Why are you crying?

15
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,180
Because she's so beautiful.

16
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:15,049
I'm just thankful she was born.

17
00:01:16,579 --> 00:01:17,750
I feel sorry too.

18
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:20,650
I don't know.
It's hard to put it into words.

19
00:01:23,859 --> 00:01:25,319
What are you thinking about?

20
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:29,590
I'm worried.

21
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,359
About what?

22
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,769
What if...

23
00:01:35,269 --> 00:01:36,769
she doesn't like me?

24
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:40,469
What are you talking about?
You're her dad.

25
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,650
Gosh, she's crying.

26
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,920
Why is she crying all of a sudden?

27
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:56,819
Probably for the same reason as us.

28
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:01,260
She must be excited and scared.

29
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:04,560
There's a lot she wants to say,

30
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,700
but it's hard to explain in words.

31

Choi Jae Seop, let go of her.
What are you doing?

43
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:46,830
You knew, didn't you?

44
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:49,930
You knew,

45
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,270
and you controlled us...

46
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:57,180

47
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,909

us.

Are you crazy, Jae Seop? Let go.

50
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:16,759
I said, let go!

51
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,000
Are you okay?

52
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,170
What's wrong with you,
Detective Choi?

Come with me.

What's going on, Detective Cha?

57
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,689
I'll be back after a talk with him.

58
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:09,279
How did you find out?

59
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:18,519
I don't know where I should
begin to explain, but...

60
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:19,889
Don't.

61
00:05:24,329 --> 00:05:27,269
I won't listen to your excuses
or explanations.

62
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,069
Just answer my questions.

63
00:05:31,339 --> 00:05:32,740
When did you find out?

64
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,709
While investigating
Park Gyung Chun's case.

65
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,550
Yes. I thought so.

66
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,550
Does Do Hyun Su know...

67
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,519
that you know?

68
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,759
No.

69
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,839
Let's do this.

70
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:10,980
You didn't know anything.

71
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,649
With the evidence I have,

72
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:17,720
we can prove Baek Hee Seong
is Do Hyun Su.

73
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:22,449
I won't make you get involved.

74
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:25,620
You're the biggest victim
of Do Hyun Su's.

75
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:29,360
You couldn't do anything
and was dragged all the way here.

76
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:31,199
Right?

77
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,370
Cha Ji Won!

78
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,470
The feelings you have now
are not real.

79
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,670
You couldn't handle
the shocking situation,

80
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,069
so you assimilated to the assailant.

81
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:45,040
You're trying to relieve the shock.
You know this, don't you?

82
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,910
No, it's not that.

83
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:49,610
The truth is different. I know.

84
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,620
What happened
to the real Baek Hee Seong?

85
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,120
Do you know that too?

86
00:06:57,019 --> 00:06:59,490
His identity was stolen
for over 10 years.

87
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,459
Do you think he'll still be safe?

88
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,629
But Baek Hee Seong's parents
helped him.

89
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,970
The biological parents gave
their son's identity to him.

90
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,069
He's not someone...

91
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:17,069
who'd hurt others.

92
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:18,310
Do you have proof?

93
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:21,449
Aside from what you believe,
do you have proof?

94
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:27,389
Please, have mercy on me.

95
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:31,360
Act like you don't know.
I'm begging you.

96
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:35,759
Do you mean it?

97
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,800
I'll prove him innocent
with my life.

98
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:43,839
He'll become a spectacle
if he gets caught by the police.

99
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:49,470
The son of a serial murderer,
a psychopath, and a police wife...

100
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,879
It's obvious how the world
will look at him.

101
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,879
Everyone will look at him like he's
a show and throw rocks at him.

102
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:58,120
You know it too.

103
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,649
No one cares about the boring truth.

104
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:03,959
How can I watch that?
How can I watch that happen?

105
00:08:16,269 --> 00:08:18,470
You'll resent me now,

106
00:08:19,269 --> 00:08:21,410
but in the end, you'll thank me.

107
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:23,170
Jae Seop, please...

108
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:27,079
Tonight,
we'll snatch Yeom Sang Chul.

109
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:31,519
I'll arrest Do Hyun Su
tomorrow morning.

110
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:36,289
I can't leave you the way it is,

111
00:08:39,389 --> 00:08:40,490
so stay out of this case.

112
00:08:42,259 --> 00:08:44,159
Keep your eyes closed...

113
00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:48,230
until everything is over.

114
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:55,139
Jae Seop. Jae Seop.

115
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:58,909
Jae Seop...

116
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,490
Once the money is handed over,
the second rendezvous will happen.

117
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,330
In that meeting,
people will be trafficked.

118
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:20,529
The police need to raid the scene.

119
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,000
If I end up...

120
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:29,070
being unable to tell the police
about this location,

121
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:33,340
you will have to do it.

122
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:36,080
How?

123
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,429
What is this?

124
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:55,870
It's a receiver.

125
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:01,070
There's a listening device
in the money bag.

126
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:03,940
But it's not visible
to the naked eye.

127
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:07,610
What if they use a detector?

128
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,850
Didn't they tell you not to bring
any communication devices?

129
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,309
Hey.

130
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:57,899
Clear.

131
00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:00,129
Sit down.

132
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:12,639
What if they use a detector?

133
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:15,879
It's simple.

134
00:11:18,549 --> 00:11:19,720
I'll turn it on...

135
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,620
later.

136
00:11:44,409 --> 00:11:47,679
Yes. That's excellent.

137
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:50,679
Hey, count the bills.

138
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,250
Yes, sir.

139
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:14,740
Where should I go
to pick up my goods?

140
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,110
Why are you in such a hurry?

141
00:12:16,409 --> 00:12:17,809
Let me count the money first.

142
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,519
(Hae Su)

143
00:12:31,789 --> 00:12:34,429
- Hey.
- How's it going?

144
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:36,990
So far, so good.

145
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:38,899
Is something wrong?

146
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:42,700
I think I found out something.

147
00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:44,870
What?

148
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:47,240
I'll explain it in detail later.

149
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:49,110
Before that,

150
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,340
I have a favor to ask.

151
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:54,279
The informant
will let us know immediately...

152
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:57,110
where the human trafficking
is taking place.

153
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,590
Yeom Sang Chul
and Sung Je Goo won't be there.

154
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:04,490
We believe Lee Tae Sub,
Jin Chang Jin,

155
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,389
Oh Gwang Sik,
and Park Chang Soo...

156
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:10,230
will be there.

157
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:13,529
Make sure you familiarize yourselves
with their names and faces.

158
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:25,509
Detective Cha won't be coming
with us today.

159
00:13:29,049 --> 00:13:30,379
What in the world is going on?

160
00:13:34,549 --> 00:13:37,389
Her daughter...

161
00:13:37,789 --> 00:13:39,059
is hospitalized.

162
00:13:39,389 --> 00:13:40,460
Eun Ha?

163
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:43,289
Yes. I think she's quite ill.

164
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,399
We were busy
since early morning,

165
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:46,929
so she could neither tell us
nor visit the hospital.

166
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:49,669
I told her
to check on her daughter first.

167
00:13:52,169 --> 00:13:53,570
Eun Ha's doing fine.

168
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:55,909
You don't need to worry.

169
00:13:57,009 --> 00:13:59,409
- Hey...
- She's sleeping at my mom's.

170
00:14:00,009 --> 00:14:01,409
Thank you for your concern.

171
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:07,320
Ji Won, I don't think
you should be doing this right now.

172
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,990
I think you should do as I say.

173
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,419
I have to take part in this mission
no matter what.

174
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,629
- Why is that?
- Because it's my work.

175
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,679
(Jaerim-ro 57-37)

176
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,919
Memorize it.

177
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,730
"Jaerim-ro 57-37".

178
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,100
Your goods will be there.

179
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,269
You can go there right now.

180
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:58,200
"Jaerim-ro 57-37".

181
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:02,570
According to the informant,
the three abducted victims...

182
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:05,139
I've received a call.
It's the informant.

183
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,580
Cha Ji Won speaking.

184
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:19,259
I'm... I'm Do Hyun Su.

185
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,759
I'm listening.

186
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:23,429
It's Jaerim-ro 57-37.

187
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:25,899
Yeom Sang Chul's boys
are waiting there...

188
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:28,100
with the abducted victims.

189
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,370
I got the address.

190
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,899
It's "Jaerim-ro 57-37".

191
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:37,539
I'll text you the address. Let's go.

192
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:38,809
- Let's go.
- All right.

193
00:15:38,809 --> 00:15:40,009
Let's get going.

194
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,279
Stay here.

195
00:15:47,419 --> 00:15:49,450
And come up with whatever reason
you need...

196
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:50,950
to drop out of the reinvestigation.

197
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,659
- It's only right.
- You know better than anyone...

198
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,759
that I want nothing more
than to solve this case.

199
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:57,899
That's the problem.

200
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,629
You're too emotionally attached
to this.

201
00:16:00,629 --> 00:16:02,529
We even requested backup.

202
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:05,440
Do you expect me
to sit here and wait?

203
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,009
Would you be able to do that
if you were me?

204
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,480
Our goal today...

205
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:15,779
is to arrest Yeom Sang Chul
and all of his men.

206
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:20,820
And Hyun Su will only want
to speak with me.

207
00:16:25,659 --> 00:16:27,759
Do you still think I'm of no use?

208
00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:31,230
Answer me.

209
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:33,529
I'll do as you say.

210
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:38,470
(Jaerim-ro 57-37)

211
00:16:46,779 --> 00:16:48,080
Where's the information
regarding the accomplice?

212
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,250
I have it with me.

213
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:57,419
Photo, name, and address.

214
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,339
(Baek)

215
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:24,680
Let's have a time out.

216
00:17:31,089 --> 00:17:33,420
Why, hello. It's been a long time.

217
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:37,329
I don't think you should be happy
to get a call from me.

218
00:17:38,259 --> 00:17:40,160
I'm not sure what you mean.

219
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,329
I'll cut to the chase...

220
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:44,029
and tell you two reasons...

221
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:45,740
why you should get rid of that guy
in front of you.

222
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,809
Number one.

223
00:17:50,309 --> 00:17:53,539
Do Hyun Su is working
with the police right now.

224
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:55,650
I see.

225
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:58,119
Number two.

226
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:02,619
I'll give you twofold
of what he paid you.

227
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:05,789
"Twofold"?

228
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:12,799
Goodness. For a second,
I forgot who was boss...

229
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,930
and almost made a huge mistake.

230
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:20,140
He's been hiding his identity
all along.

231
00:18:21,609 --> 00:18:23,140
He may be working with the police,

232
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,410
but he'll never be able to see them
in person.

233
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,049
I'm pretty sure
the police aren't there.

234
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:33,579
I see. Thank you so much
for calling. Yes.

235
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:35,720
Goodbye.

236
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,599
Hey, pack all the money in the safe.

237
00:18:51,099 --> 00:18:52,369
We should wrap up here.

238
00:18:53,069 --> 00:18:54,140
Yes, sir.

239
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,410
I'd like to know what's going on.

240
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,589
One question.

241
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:17,059
Do you like mountains or seas?

242
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,470
Where do you want to be buried,
you rat!

243
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,859
I can't sleep.

244
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,660
I'm scared.

245
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:50,430
Scared of what?

246
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,730
Do Hyun Su.

247
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,099
He'll never give up my identity.

248
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:01,710
He'll never let me live.

249
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:04,440
Don't you worry about that.

250
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,809
I won't let that happen.

251
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:19,990
Who is it?

252
00:20:22,059 --> 00:20:23,190
Who is it at this hour?

253
00:20:24,329 --> 00:20:26,200
I don't know. It's a stranger.

254
00:20:27,829 --> 00:20:28,930
Who are you?

255
00:20:31,099 --> 00:20:32,869
I'm sorry at this late hour.

256
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:37,569
My name is Do Hae Su.

257
00:20:41,779 --> 00:20:42,849
The thing is...

258
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,619
Hyun Su...

259
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,619
Do Hyun Su is my brother.

260
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,730
I have something urgent to discuss.

261
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:01,569
I know it's rude,
but I asked around for your address.

262
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:03,799
I'm very sorry.

263
00:21:27,089 --> 00:21:29,089
(Jaerim-ro 57-37,
human trafficking scene)

264
00:21:29,089 --> 00:21:30,490
Did you check the goods?

265
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,759
Yes, sir.

266
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:41,200
Who is that?

267
00:21:41,869 --> 00:21:43,769
We're from Violent Crimes Unit
of Gangsu Police Station.

268
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:45,779
We received a tip about
human trafficking.

269
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:46,779
Run!

270
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,079
Hey, stop!

271
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,079
Stop right there!

272
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,460
You punk!

273
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:02,390
Darn!

274
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:04,589
Catch them!

275
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:13,069
Come over here.

276
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,240
Don't come near me.

277
00:22:15,369 --> 00:22:17,210
- I'll kill you.
- Step aside.

278
00:22:20,109 --> 00:22:22,109
Who are you? Do you want to die?

279
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,329
You punk!

280
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:12,859
Die!

281
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,299
You little...

282
00:23:21,369 --> 00:23:23,609
Why aren't you wearing any
protective gear at a crime scene?

283
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,009
Why?

284
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:28,609
I already knew everything.

285
00:23:28,609 --> 00:23:30,950
I knew he had a knife on him.

286
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,220
What if you got stabbed?

287
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,920
Although you got lucky
during Park Gyung Chun's case,

288
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:36,549
you almost died today.

289
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,660
Don't you even think of your family?

290
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,559
You better not butt in
like that next time.

291
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,690
Do you know how startled I was?

292
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:47,329
There is no next time for me.

293
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:52,099
Yes?

294
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,970
We've arrested Lee Tae Sub.

295
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,640
I think they've arrested
everyone else over there too.

296
00:23:57,869 --> 00:23:59,579
Let's go. Let's talk on the way.

297
00:24:00,109 --> 00:24:01,180
Jae Seop.

298
00:24:04,579 --> 00:24:06,250
I still have something left to do.

299
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:05,279
Let me ask you one thing.

300
00:25:05,779 --> 00:25:07,940
What will you gain
from colluding with the police?

301
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:10,680
Who said that?

302
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,019
Who said I was colluding
with the police?

303
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:15,119
You fool. Why are you doing
something so crazy?

304
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,289
The police won't help you!

305
00:25:18,289 --> 00:25:19,819
I asked you who it is!

306
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,160
Think about it carefully.

307
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:25,430
About who you leaked this secret to.

308
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:30,470
Who sold you off to me?

309
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:31,970
I wonder who it is.

310
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,609
The police? A friend?

311
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:38,210
A girlfriend? Do you want to know?

312
00:25:39,339 --> 00:25:40,509
Too bad, though.

313
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:42,349
In order to catch the person
who betrayed you,

314
00:25:42,349 --> 00:25:43,809
you need to get out of here,

315
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:45,380
but you can't.

316
00:25:48,349 --> 00:25:49,420
You'll never get out alive.

317
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:51,349
Tie him up.

318
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:10,470
What is that sound?

319
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,140
Go check.

320
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:21,819
Who are you?

321
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:24,789
Oh, I'm just checking this.
It works well.

322
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,670
Hey, big man.

323
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:46,910
Hey, Hyun Su! Where are you?

324
00:26:47,309 --> 00:26:50,009
This thing is out of gas.
Hey, come out!

325
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:57,990
You're working as an informant
for the cops,

326
00:26:58,589 --> 00:27:01,289
but that punk is the only one
who came to save you?

327
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,490
If I were you,

328
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:07,099
I'd get the money
and get out of here now.

329
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,069
Why?

330
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:11,970
Because you're done for.

331
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:14,769
You'll be...

332
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,440
the first to go,

333
00:27:18,309 --> 00:27:19,380
not me.

334
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,640
Thank you.

335
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:27,009
I didn't know you kept in touch
with your brother.

336
00:28:28,849 --> 00:28:31,079
I didn't see him once
for 18 years.

337
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:33,519
I've only met him recently.

338
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:38,119
For us, I'm afraid this is bad news.

339
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,890
The fact that Hyun Su
talked about...

340
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:45,029
our relationship
with someone else...

341
00:28:45,859 --> 00:28:47,730
It makes us very uncomfortable.

342
00:28:51,069 --> 00:28:52,200
I'm sorry.

343
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:57,009
- Ms. Do Hae Su.
- Yes?

344
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:00,740
How did Hyun Su explain...

345
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:02,279
about us?

346
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,789
He told me your son is unconscious.

347
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:16,789
That's why you allowed Hyun Su
to take your son's identity.

348
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:21,200
He told me you two pitied him
although you know his situation.

349
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,000
That's what I heard.

350
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:29,509
Did he say anything else?

351
00:29:30,609 --> 00:29:32,109
He said that you're good people.

352
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:36,180
Hurry up and tell us.

353
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,250
What?

354
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:43,420
Why did you ask around
for our address...

355
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,990
to come and see us?

356
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,759
Right. Okay.

357
00:29:58,170 --> 00:29:59,470
Please take a look at this.

358
00:30:02,369 --> 00:30:03,470
It's...

359
00:30:04,809 --> 00:30:07,880
This is the bracelet our hospital's
overseas medical volunteers wore.

360
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:09,480
Why are you asking about this?

361
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:12,619
I'd like your help with getting
the list of the volunteers...

362
00:30:12,619 --> 00:30:16,650
and their pictures
from 1999 to 2002.

363
00:30:20,589 --> 00:30:22,890
I assume you two are also nervous...

364
00:30:23,589 --> 00:30:26,759
because of the reinvestigation
of the Yeonju Serial Murder Case.

365
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,130
Why?
Why do you think we'll be nervous?

366
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:32,640
Pardon?

367
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,410
That's because...

368
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:37,940
Yes, that's right.

369
00:30:39,609 --> 00:30:42,079
We're worried Hyun Su might get
involved in that case.

370
00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:45,450
We're nervous whenever we watch
the news.

371
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,720
Hyun Su didn't do it.

372
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:50,650
He really has nothing to do
with Father's crimes.

373
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:52,690
I know. I do.

374
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:56,490
We believe Hyun Su too.

375
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:01,160
But what does that case...

376
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,000
have anything to do
with this bracelet?

377
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:11,269
June 10, 2002. A man visited...

378
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:12,839
Father's funeral.

379
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:16,009
He was wearing that bracelet.

380
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:20,049
I recently found out...

381
00:31:20,049 --> 00:31:22,589
that the man from that day
is Father's accomplice.

382
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:30,390
If I see his face again,

383
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:35,299
I might be able to recognize him.

384
00:32:13,339 --> 00:32:14,470
Darn it.

385
00:32:33,289 --> 00:32:34,490
(It's Reporter Kim.)

386
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:38,589
Hello, everyone. I'm Kim Mu Jin
of The Hanjoogan.

387
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:43,630
No, this is not an ASMR.

388
00:32:46,769 --> 00:32:50,009
I'm currently undercover
at the scene...

389
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:51,609
of a human trafficking
organization in action.

390
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:56,950
But I'm in a really tricky position.

391
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:02,789
(He's undercover?)

392
00:33:02,789 --> 00:33:03,890
(That's crazy!)

393
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:05,019
(I'm too scared to watch.)

394
00:33:05,019 --> 00:33:06,190
(Be careful, Reporter Kim!)

395
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:12,359
If something happens to me,

396
00:33:13,259 --> 00:33:14,930
please report it to the police.

397
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:21,039
Jaerim-dong. Hakjin Building's
basement parking lot.

398
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:42,990
Everyone! Even if I die,

399
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:45,700
journalism won't die!

400
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,030
You stabbed me in the back,

401
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:27,300
so it'd wouldn't be right
to kill you so fast.

402
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:32,440
Darn you, jerk!
Look at what you made me go through.

403
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:36,809
Listen. I'm going to make you
have a painful death.

404
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:38,980
I want you to scream for mercy.

405
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,179
I'll kill you.

406
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,190
Even if I die,

407
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,090
tell me
who stabbed my back at least.

408
00:34:49,329 --> 00:34:52,500
It would make it more painful
for me, won't it?

409
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:59,070
Stop trying to pull a trick.

410
00:35:01,139 --> 00:35:03,239
I gave it a thought about...

411
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:05,409
who your bunch might be from.

412
00:35:20,659 --> 00:35:23,630
You shouldn't have messed with me.

413
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:25,730
You should blame yourself.

414
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:49,320
What is this?

415
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:32,630
Are you okay, honey?

416
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:00,820
Hurry up.

417
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,530
Darn it.

418
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,559
Stay still.

419
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,730
What did I do?

420
00:37:10,929 --> 00:37:13,539
Are you all right?
We'll drive you home.

421
00:37:15,469 --> 00:37:16,570
Wait.

422
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:20,039
In Seo, what happened?

423
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,750
Can I go home now?

424
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:27,719
- Of course.
- Then everything is fine.

425
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:30,949
It's okay as long as I can go home.

426
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,920
- Please take good care of him.
- Okay.

427
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,599
Where's Detective Cha?

428
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:53,179
Eun Ha has a fever again,

429
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:55,480
so I told Detective Cha to go.

430
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,650
I should be understanding, right?

431
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,190
Yes. Her child is sick.

432
00:38:03,989 --> 00:38:06,159
I assume you must have a reason...

433
00:38:07,019 --> 00:38:08,920
to lie to me.

434
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:20,139
I still have things to do.

435
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,110
Please let me go and check...

436
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:26,539
if he's safe.

437
00:38:35,019 --> 00:38:38,820
I'm going to go arrest Do Hyun Su
tomorrow morning no matter what.

438
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:42,860
You have until tomorrow morning.

439
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:47,730
Whatever you do tonight...

440
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:50,070
is none of my business.

441
00:38:58,039 --> 00:38:59,139
Ji... Ji Won.

442
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,579
You knew...

443
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:07,719
all along?

444
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,590
Put your hands above your head.

445
00:39:22,429 --> 00:39:23,500
Ji Won.

446
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,630
Ji Won!

447
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:28,869
Hey!

448
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:32,139
- Come here!
- Stop!

449
00:39:32,809 --> 00:39:33,880
Stop!

450
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,480
Die! Die!

451
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:55,969
Die!

452
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:25,860
Stop! I said, stop!

453
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:30,769
You shouldn't be here right now.

454
00:40:31,369 --> 00:40:33,739
We probably already received
search warrants...

455
00:40:33,769 --> 00:40:35,340
for his house, office, and store.

456
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:39,139
The police will barge in here too.

457
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:40,739
Get up.

458
00:40:41,409 --> 00:40:42,550
Hurry up!

459
00:40:42,949 --> 00:40:44,079
Get up right now.

460
00:40:47,349 --> 00:40:48,679
You can't go home either.

461
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:52,860
Detective Choi found proof
that you're Do Hyun Su.

462
00:40:53,219 --> 00:40:54,590
He's going to arrest you tomorrow.

463
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:59,429
Go.

464
00:41:01,699 --> 00:41:03,469
Go as far away as possible tonight.

465
00:41:07,539 --> 00:41:08,869
Don't you get it?

466
00:41:09,539 --> 00:41:11,269
I said, leave!

467
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:17,280
Go somewhere even I can't find...

468
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,780
and never come back.

469
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:24,019
Why are you standing here?

470
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:26,820
Aren't running away and hiding
your specialties?

471
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:29,360
You...

472
00:41:30,059 --> 00:41:32,630
Are you going to rot in prison
instead of your sister?

473
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,670
Go. I said, leave!

474
00:41:42,039 --> 00:41:43,170
Go!

475
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:21,139
Detective... Detective Cha.

476
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,940
I came here to cover a story.

477
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:29,909
This is Detective Cha Ji Won
from Gangsu Police Station.

478
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,880
I need a backup.

479
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:45,159
There doesn't need to be a reason
for falling out of love either.

480
00:43:46,659 --> 00:43:47,900
I don't love you anymore.

481
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:51,099
I just don't.

482
00:43:58,039 --> 00:43:59,039
I wish...

483
00:44:00,039 --> 00:44:02,480
you could live as me
for just one day.

484
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:07,079
That way, you'd know how much...

485
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:10,650
I love you.

486
00:44:15,389 --> 00:44:17,289
Once this case is over,

487
00:44:19,159 --> 00:44:21,059
I want to raise Eun Ha
and live quietly...

488
00:44:21,059 --> 00:44:22,530
where there's fresh air.

489
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:25,130
Would you...

490
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:27,840
like that?

491
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:08,179
(Husband)

492
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,360
(Husband)

493
00:45:34,969 --> 00:45:37,269
(Husband)

494
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:47,650
Ji Won.

495
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:49,550
Ji Won.

496
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:51,789
Please...

497
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,619
Please answer the phone, will you?

498
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:57,389
(Husband)

499
00:46:08,039 --> 00:46:09,239
How can we...

500
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:13,440
This can't be.

501
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:14,980
Okay?

502
00:47:13,969 --> 00:47:15,670
Why are you doing this to me?

503
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:18,610
Why?

504
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:23,010
You can't live
as Baek Hee Seong anymore.

505
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:25,610
Your cover has been blown.

506
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:29,820
So run away.

507
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:33,190
I'm letting you do that.

508
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:40,429
What more do you want from me?

509
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:43,800
What more can I do?

510
00:47:48,969 --> 00:47:50,170
Why?

511
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:55,280
You knew everything.

512
00:47:58,010 --> 00:47:59,949
So why didn't you leave me?

513
00:48:03,519 --> 00:48:05,150
I don't understand.

514
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:07,860
Do you really not know?

515
00:48:11,429 --> 00:48:13,199
Despite finding out everything,

516
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:16,829
I did my best to protect you.

517
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,400
Do you really not know why?

518
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:40,860
I'm sorry.

519
00:48:44,389 --> 00:48:46,530
I'm sorry, Ji Won.

520
00:48:52,199 --> 00:48:54,070
It's all my fault.

521
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,800
I hurt...

522
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,869
I hurt you.

523
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:02,039
I made you suffer.

524
00:49:10,989 --> 00:49:12,090
You knew everything...

525
00:49:14,119 --> 00:49:15,460
But you still...

526
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:20,460
I had no choice.

527
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:25,130
I just had no choice.

528
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:55,260
I want to go home, Ji Won.

529
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:03,809
Okay, let's go.

530
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:06,679
Let's go home.

531
00:50:09,079 --> 00:50:10,280
Whatever happens,

532
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:14,380
let's start over from there.

533
00:50:25,559 --> 00:50:27,159
Please look into it for me.

534
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:33,099
I'll ask around,
but don't get your hopes up.

535
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:35,639
It's been 20 years.

536
00:50:36,239 --> 00:50:38,940
I'm not sure if the information
on civilian volunteers...

537
00:50:39,269 --> 00:50:41,309
will still be left.

538
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:43,150
In the papers I gave you,

539
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:44,809
there are some notes about how
they were selected as volunteers.

540
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:47,449
They were required to submit
various amounts of papers.

541
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:51,150
I'll read them thoroughly.

542
00:50:51,949 --> 00:50:55,059
I'm so glad I can ask for your help.

543
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,690
- Thank you so much.
- Don't worry about it.

544
00:51:00,199 --> 00:51:02,829
We too are people...

545
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,030
who are inseparable from Hyun Su.

546
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,239
Then I'll get going now.

547
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:21,119
Wait, Ms. Do.

548
00:51:21,949 --> 00:51:22,980
Yes?

549
00:51:23,989 --> 00:51:27,760
About that accomplice you said
you met before.

550
00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:32,130
Was there anything peculiar
about him that you noticed?

551
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:43,869
If you know anything, it may be
helpful for my husband...

552
00:51:44,369 --> 00:51:46,340
to find him sooner.

553
00:51:52,050 --> 00:51:55,519
There wasn't anything particular
about his face.

554
00:51:56,789 --> 00:51:59,860
But his left fingernails
were strangely very short.

555
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:03,230
As if he had a habit of biting
his left fingernails.

556
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:38,730
Lady.

557
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:41,800
Don't meddle.

558
00:52:42,829 --> 00:52:44,400
You're not the only one who saw me.

559
00:52:45,769 --> 00:52:47,170
I saw you too.

560
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:49,769
You have a small, red car.

561
00:52:51,969 --> 00:52:53,809
I know where you work and live too.

562
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:31,550
- All done. Please pay the bill.
- Okay.

563
00:53:31,550 --> 00:53:32,710
It's an emergency!

564
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:34,420
Please come this way!

565
00:53:39,889 --> 00:53:41,190
Get the Ambu bag!

566
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,860
Get up. Let's go.

567
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:49,530
Come on, let's get moving.

568
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:56,269
Please...help me up.

569
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:10,059
This means...

570
00:57:10,869 --> 00:57:14,599
I still have one more chance, right?

571
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:27,349
What will you do?

572
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:29,219
Calm down.

573
00:57:30,719 --> 00:57:33,050
Nothing has happened yet.

574
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:36,989
Even if you don't find that list,

575
00:57:37,130 --> 00:57:38,789
I'm sure she'll dig it up somehow.

576
00:57:39,559 --> 00:57:41,059
I told you to calm down.

577
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,809
There's no evidence to prove
that the man Do Hae Su saw...

578
00:57:50,909 --> 00:57:53,440
at Do Min Seok's funeral
was his accomplice.

579
00:57:54,139 --> 00:57:56,210
It's just her argument.

580
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:57,880
What if Hyun Su finds out?

581
00:57:58,349 --> 00:57:59,980
He won't sit still
when he finds out.

582
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:02,619
He won't leave Hee Seong alone.

583
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:08,190
I already took care...

584
00:58:10,059 --> 00:58:11,760
of Hyun Su.

585
00:58:15,199 --> 00:58:16,199
What do you mean?

586
00:58:20,599 --> 00:58:22,039
Take your hand out of your mouth.

587
00:58:25,539 --> 00:58:27,239
I said, hand out of your mouth.

588
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:33,210
How many times did I tell you
to fix that habit?

589
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:41,320
What's the matter with you?

590
00:58:43,159 --> 00:58:44,989
Why are you hitting him?

591
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:47,500
I told you not to hit him.
Don't hit him.

592
00:58:47,530 --> 00:58:50,469
Don't you know you can't fix him
by hitting him?

593
00:58:51,130 --> 00:58:52,230
Mom.

594
00:58:56,909 --> 00:58:59,510
Why did the person who got hit
by my car that day...

595
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:04,110
have to be Do Hyun Su?

596
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:14,889
Yes, I'm on my way.

597
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,460
Should I take care of it myself?

598
00:59:18,190 --> 00:59:20,360
No, no. That's okay.

599
00:59:22,099 --> 00:59:23,630
Thank you for saying that.

600
00:59:25,329 --> 00:59:28,940
It'll be tough,
but I should face it myself.

601
00:59:30,099 --> 00:59:31,909
Okay. Do what you want.

602
00:59:32,510 --> 00:59:33,510
Hey.

603
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:36,409
How...

604
00:59:38,179 --> 00:59:39,780
did that person look?

605
00:59:41,650 --> 00:59:43,380
I don't think
the person remembers you.

606
00:59:44,989 --> 00:59:46,019
I'm glad.

607
00:59:55,530 --> 00:59:57,500
Do Min Seok won't let me go...

608
00:59:58,699 --> 00:59:59,869
even after death.

609
01:00:01,539 --> 01:00:03,139
He's trying to kill me...

610
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:07,039
by using his son.

611
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,380
I know he's capable of doing that.

612
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:17,250
I only did
what Do Min Seok told me to do.

613
01:00:19,019 --> 01:00:20,820
If I don't listen to him,

614
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:24,730
he threatened to kill you two.

615
01:00:28,030 --> 01:00:29,659
I was too scared.

616
01:00:33,369 --> 01:00:35,469
I really didn't want to do it.

617
01:00:36,239 --> 01:00:37,340
I mean it.

618
01:00:38,239 --> 01:00:39,469
Please trust me.

619
01:00:51,449 --> 01:00:52,590
Dad.

620
01:00:56,719 --> 01:00:57,860
Mom.

621
01:01:05,469 --> 01:01:08,039
You'll protect me, right?

622
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:53,150
I got you.

623
01:01:55,050 --> 01:01:57,090
Hyun Su. Listen carefully.

624
01:01:58,050 --> 01:02:00,420
You could die
if you lose your way here.

625
01:02:01,590 --> 01:02:04,829
Over there... If you go beyond that,

626
01:02:05,059 --> 01:02:06,260
it's a cliff.

627
01:02:09,730 --> 01:02:11,570
That's my first memory.

628
01:02:15,969 --> 01:02:17,570
I was 10 then.

629
01:02:18,969 --> 01:02:22,179
I don't have any memories
from before I was 10.

630
01:02:22,909 --> 01:02:25,179
Don't you remember why you were...

631
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:27,349
wandering in that forest?

632
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:31,489
No.

633
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:35,889
I felt lost...

634
01:02:36,690 --> 01:02:40,059
in a deep and dark maze.

635
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:42,530
Then,

636
01:02:43,699 --> 01:02:46,099
I felt a sense of relief
after Father found me.

637
01:02:47,869 --> 01:02:49,099
That's all.

638
01:02:51,510 --> 01:02:53,639
Why do you still have this on?

639
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:59,010
It makes me feel good to know...

640
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:01,550
that you know...

641
01:03:02,679 --> 01:03:03,820
wherever I am.

642
01:03:06,519 --> 01:03:08,460
You're a strange man.

643
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:14,059
How much did you tail me?

644
01:03:19,369 --> 01:03:21,769
When you met Ms. Do Hae Su
at the abandoned building,

645
01:03:22,469 --> 01:03:24,110
I was there too.

646
01:03:25,909 --> 01:03:27,710
That's when you said...

647
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:32,409
you never loved me
even for a moment.

648
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:38,250
I can't remember...

649
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:42,289
how I got back home
after hearing that.

650
01:03:51,030 --> 01:03:52,469
Why are you crying again?

651
01:03:53,199 --> 01:03:54,539
I don't know.

652
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:56,969
I know why.

653
01:04:00,309 --> 01:04:01,840
It's because you love me.

654
01:04:06,909 --> 01:04:09,050
No. I...

655
01:04:10,449 --> 01:04:11,920
I can't do that.

656
01:04:12,619 --> 01:04:16,219
You always wanted me to be happy.

657
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:20,090
That's because I had to fool you.

658
01:04:24,329 --> 01:04:26,230
When I was still studying,

659
01:04:26,829 --> 01:04:29,000
I'd come out late
from the library...

660
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:32,309
but still find you waiting for me.

661
01:04:33,809 --> 01:04:35,139
That's when...

662
01:04:36,179 --> 01:04:38,610
I felt...

663
01:04:39,579 --> 01:04:41,079
that you truly like me.

664
01:04:43,550 --> 01:04:46,050
When my dad suddenly passed away,

665
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:49,690
it felt like the sky fell down
and I was hopeless.

666
01:04:51,690 --> 01:04:54,800
I was always nervous and angry then.

667
01:04:56,199 --> 01:04:58,429
I'd cry over nothing.

668
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:02,739
But when I was unstable,

669
01:05:03,570 --> 01:05:06,440
you didn't pressure me
or try to counsel me like others.

670
01:05:09,210 --> 01:05:11,980
Instead, you learned how to cook
and made food for me.

671
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:14,949
They were all delicious.

672
01:05:18,789 --> 01:05:20,989
Just like that, I was okay again.

673
01:05:28,159 --> 01:05:29,760
You love me.

674
01:05:32,230 --> 01:05:33,670
That's what I feel.

675
01:05:45,710 --> 01:05:46,780
I...

676
01:05:49,050 --> 01:05:50,280
love you.

677
01:06:06,030 --> 01:06:07,269
I...

678
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:09,969
love you, Ji Won.

679
01:06:17,679 --> 01:06:19,710
Tomorrow, many people...

680
01:06:20,449 --> 01:06:24,190
will try to define and judge
the kind of person you are.

681
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:28,619
That's okay.

682
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:30,929
Things like that...

683
01:06:32,429 --> 01:06:33,889
don't scare me anymore.

684
01:06:35,329 --> 01:06:37,400
Don't ever forget.

685
01:06:38,469 --> 01:06:40,699
You're a warm person.

686
01:06:45,570 --> 01:06:46,670
You're...

687
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:50,210
even stranger than me.

688
01:06:58,119 --> 01:06:59,820
What about after that?

689
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:06,159
I started working as a deliveryman
at a Chinese restaurant.

690
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:11,269
I met a man named Nam Soo then
who had a shoe repair store.

691
01:07:11,269 --> 01:07:12,570
When do I come into the picture?

692
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:14,940
Just hang in there.

693
01:07:17,610 --> 01:07:19,239
I have to face...

694
01:07:20,570 --> 01:07:23,809
two more near-death experiences
before I meet you.

695
01:07:28,679 --> 01:07:30,320
It looks like your path to me...

696
01:07:31,619 --> 01:07:33,650
was ridiculously rough.

697
01:07:38,889 --> 01:07:40,289
Ji Won.

698
01:07:42,199 --> 01:07:45,170
You're the part in my life
that's unexplainable.

699
01:07:47,369 --> 01:07:48,639
It's unrealistic.

700
01:07:50,199 --> 01:07:51,340
It's absurd.

701
01:08:29,979 --> 01:08:31,449
Why haven't you been picking up?

702
01:08:32,210 --> 01:08:34,850
You should've told me
what happened last night.

703
01:08:35,380 --> 01:08:37,850
You know very well
that I can't call Hyun Su myself,

704
01:08:37,850 --> 01:08:39,319
so how could you not text me?

705
01:08:39,850 --> 01:08:41,260
My phone broke.

706
01:08:42,460 --> 01:08:43,789
What happened to your face?

707
01:08:44,359 --> 01:08:45,529
That was quick.

708
01:08:45,529 --> 01:08:46,859
Come in first.

709
01:08:51,470 --> 01:08:53,800
Where's Hyun Su? Is he all right?

710
01:08:56,569 --> 01:08:57,640
I don't know.

711
01:08:57,970 --> 01:09:00,880
What do you mean?
If you don't know, then who does?

712
01:09:04,109 --> 01:09:05,909
Detective Cha knows everything.

713
01:09:07,380 --> 01:09:08,449
What?

714
01:09:09,619 --> 01:09:11,090
I have no idea...

715
01:09:12,350 --> 01:09:14,090
what happened to him...

716
01:09:15,159 --> 01:09:16,560
or what the future holds for him.

717
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:27,699
Okay.

718
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,069
Jae Seop.

719
01:09:31,510 --> 01:09:32,739
I have a favor to ask.

720
01:09:35,079 --> 01:09:36,609
Please don't cuff him.

721
01:09:38,909 --> 01:09:41,479
And if you can,
please don't cause a scene.

722
01:09:45,090 --> 01:09:47,090
I'll bring him out after 30 minutes.

723
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:50,489
Thanks.

724
01:10:07,609 --> 01:10:08,779
Detective Choi...

725
01:10:10,279 --> 01:10:11,449
is in front of our house.

726
01:10:20,119 --> 01:10:25,390
(Where the Morning Star Hovers)

727
01:11:24,619 --> 01:11:29,159
(Flower of Evil)

728
01:11:29,390 --> 01:11:30,659
Do Hyun Su, why did you kill...

729
01:11:30,659 --> 01:11:34,289
the village foreman
of Gagyeong-ri in 2002?

730
01:11:34,289 --> 01:11:38,130
Mom, Hee Seong
can't pick Eun Ha up today.

731
01:11:38,270 --> 01:11:41,199
I wanted to ask your sister
why she did it and resent her.

732
01:11:41,369 --> 01:11:43,170
But I held back
because I knew it wasn't right.

733
01:11:43,270 --> 01:11:44,470
This isn't fair.

734
01:11:44,710 --> 01:11:47,170
I'm here to keep my promise.

735
01:11:47,270 --> 01:11:50,010
The one I said I'd tell you
when the time was right.

736
01:11:50,210 --> 01:11:53,109
This morning, a body was found
in the mountain,

737
01:11:53,109 --> 01:11:54,680
and it was missing a left thumbnail.

738
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:58,590
What do you know?

739
01:11:58,750 --> 01:12:00,550
What do you know?

740
01:12:00,949 --> 01:12:03,819
We're going to do our best
so you won't be falsely accused.
