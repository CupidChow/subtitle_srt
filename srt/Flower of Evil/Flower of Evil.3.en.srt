I'm back.

11
00:01:16,579 --> 00:01:19,480
It seemed like you liked
this beer brand,

12
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,319
so I took some
without my mom knowing.

13
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,760
Where did you learn to do that?

14
00:01:27,829 --> 00:01:29,459
You said you didn't go to college.

15
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,500
Is there an academy
where you learn these things?

00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,280
What are you doing?

17
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,450
Can I upload this
on my social media?

18
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,879
The caption will be
"My Good-Looking Friend".

Delete it this instant.

Okay, I will.

22

I'll delete it right now.

23
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:18,280
I didn't know you didn't like
being photographed.

24
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,710
What's your deal?

25
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:23,520
- What?
- Why are you looking into me?

26
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:26,889
I did?

27
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:32,490
Do you think I didn't notice
how you looked into me...

28
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:33,860
so nonchalantly?

29
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,229
You asked about my blood type,
sign, birthday,

30
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,259
and my favorite
and least favorite foods.

31
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:43,030
You even asked my neighbor
for my number.

32
00:02:44,469 --> 00:02:45,569
What is it?

33
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:47,909
Did someone tell you...

34
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:49,870
to look into me?

35
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,400

Reject, accept, or tell me to wait.

38
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:52,439
Say something.

39
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,509
- You.
- My name is Cha Ji Won.

40
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:01,110
Don't you ever come back here.

41
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,020
- What?
- Get out right now.

42
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:11,719
What's wrong?
Do you want me to drag you out?

43
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,810
Why are you already up?

44
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,579
Where did you go at this hour?

45
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,149
It's raining.

46
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,790
I couldn't sleep,
so I decided to work.

47
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,750
Then I ran out of beer.

48
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:21,060
You were worried about having
a beer belly recently.

49
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,399
What?

50
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,300
What is it?

51
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:30,069
Remember when I first confessed
my feelings to you?

52
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,569
You got extremely upset with me.

53
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:37,839
"Do you want me to drag you out?"

54
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:41,879
Gosh, why would you bring that up?

55
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:45,579
Why did you dislike me so much
back then?

56
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,750
It's not that.

57
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,160
It was just awkward.
No one confessed to me before.

58
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,800
Look at how innocent you are.

59
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:02,829
This is why I can't open up
about my past.

60
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:04,399
Your past?

61
00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:08,209
- Tell me.
- You'll be shocked.

62
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,339
- It's that bad?
- I'm a woman with a past.

63
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:14,110
- I was deceived all along, right?
- Yes.

64
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:16,810
Tell me. You're making me curious.

65
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,009
Does it suit your taste?

66
00:06:46,209 --> 00:06:47,449
I said, does it suit your taste?

67
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,449
I'm not eating this
because it's tasty.

68
00:06:53,649 --> 00:06:54,790
I'm just trying not to die.

69
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:59,220
Eat up. You will like it.

70
00:07:00,829 --> 00:07:02,730
I bought this near your house.

71
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,430
Simply put,
when they perform your autopsy,

72
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,870
they'll find out that this gimbap...

73
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,139
was the last food you ate.

Hey, what is that?

76
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:37,959
Are you...
Are you seriously going to kill me?

77
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,129
Is killing someone
that easy for you?

78
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:43,699
Of course not.

79

to carry you to your car...

Also, he showed how close he is
to Do Min Seok,

169
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,120
and how different he is
from Park Seo Young.

170
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,690
He's someone extremely dangerous.

171
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:50,429
For your record, Do Min Seok
killed seven people.

172
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,129
Do you mean...

173
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:57,100
this could be a serial murder case?

174
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,070
Should we transfer the case
to the regional investigation unit?

175
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,750
Section Chief Yoon.
What do you think?

176
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:11,750
It'd be too good to pass over.
He's always on the front page.

177
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:14,990
It's not like a serial murder case
already happened.

178
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:20,360
Woo Chul,
do you think you can handle it?

179
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:27,899
What if it grows into a serial
murder case as we're working on it?

180
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:31,269
I think we can catch him.

181
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:36,110
The way he picks his victims
is rather rash.

182
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,940
Victim Nam Soon Gil was
a built middle-aged man...

183
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:43,350
who lived a routined life
between his work and family.

184
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:47,450
From a criminal's perspective,
he's too risky to kill.

185
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,289
I'm sure there's room
for us to dig into.

186
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,330
What does the victim's
family tree look like?

187
00:16:00,629 --> 00:16:03,970
Just a minute. Let's see.

188
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,740
- Ho Joon.
- Yes?

189
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:09,539
If this becomes a serial murder
case, Captain Lee will lose his job.

190
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:10,669
Let's do a good job.

191
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,940
- He must be so anxious.
- Okay.

192
00:16:14,379 --> 00:16:15,909
Nam Soon Gil was an orphan,

193
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:18,019
so he doesn't have
any families or relatives.

194
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,279
But he has a spouse.

195
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,289
She's currently six months pregnant.

196
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:24,250
She fainted due to the shock
and is resting at a hospital.

197
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:26,759
Have you figured out who
he talked to on the phone last?

198
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,659
Detective Oh is looking into it.

199
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,470
I've identified the last person
Nam Soon Gil talked to on the phone.

200
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:37,070
It was Kim Mu Jin. He's a reporter
of a weekly publication.

201
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:38,700
Reporter Kim Mu Jin?

202
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,169
Do you know him?

203
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:43,909
Yes. I met him last Sunday night.

204
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,080
He was writing an article
on Kim Sang Jin's case.

205
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,179
Kim Mu Jin can't be reached
right now. His phone's off too.

206
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,850
He made his last call yesterday
around 5pm.

207
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:53,980
The person he called...

208
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:56,190
was the victim, Nam Soon Gil.

209
00:17:02,259 --> 00:17:03,389
What are you doing?

210
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,400
Detective Choi,
go to the control center...

211
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,130
to analyze
the criminal's escape route.

212
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,500
The two of you need to hurry up
and find Kim Mu Jin's whereabouts.

213
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,869
- Hurry.
- Yes, sir.

It's normal for Mu Jin.

329
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,109
He's not a kid.
He'll take medication...

330
00:30:36,109 --> 00:30:37,569
or go to the hospital.

331
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:39,839
It won't take long.
Can you drop me off over there?

332
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:42,210
Hello, is this
Mr. Park Gyung Chun?

333
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:44,650
Hello,
I'm Detective Choi Jae Seop...

334
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:45,880
from Gangsu Police Station's
violent crimes unit.

335
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,650
Didn't you pick up
a customer in a raincoat...

336
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:51,349
in Hwesin-dong at around 3:30am?

337
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:54,519
You're a very important testifier.

338
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:57,289
Goodness, thank you.

339
00:30:57,289 --> 00:30:59,730
Once you arrive, give me a call.

340
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:01,660
I'm back.

341
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,640
Where's Reporter Kim?

342
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:08,470
What are you talking about?
Weren't you looking for him?

343
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:10,569
He's not here?

344
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,309
- Hello.
- Hello.

345
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,549
The workshop's closed again.
Is your husband okay?

346
00:31:20,619 --> 00:31:22,420
He often closes his workshop
these days.

347
00:31:23,789 --> 00:31:25,619
- He does?
- Yes.

348
00:31:26,089 --> 00:31:27,559
- I'll come back next time.
- Okay.

349
00:31:48,779 --> 00:31:49,910
What's wrong with your face?

350
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:53,180
Oh, something happened.
It's nothing serious.

351
00:31:53,779 --> 00:31:56,049
- What do you mean?
- Detective Cha.

352
00:31:56,619 --> 00:31:57,890
Weren't we meeting at the station?

353
00:31:58,289 --> 00:32:00,059
What is this?
Are you here to pick me up?

354
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:22,710
Hey.

355
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:26,420
Do you think
you'll get away with this?

356
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:29,920
- How dare you deceive me?
- Just kill me.

357
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:33,059
Go on. Kill me!

358
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:36,390
I'm a reporter.

359
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:39,230
I'm not on the same level
as a village foreman.

360
00:32:48,569 --> 00:32:49,670
I can't kill you.

361
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:53,380
The police are looking for you.

362
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:04,089
They are?

363
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,859
- Why?
- I don't know the details.

364
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:10,930
So...

365
00:33:12,259 --> 00:33:14,099
you need to head there right now.

366
00:33:15,769 --> 00:33:19,269
Tidy your hair and wash off
that blood on your wrists.

367
00:33:27,809 --> 00:33:30,950
So the tables have been turned.

368
00:33:31,549 --> 00:33:32,650
Is that right?

369
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:37,490
Hey, why should I listen to you?

370
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:40,420
I guess you forgot.

371
00:33:40,859 --> 00:33:42,630
But up until just now,
you were going to kill me,

372
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:44,359
you psychopath.

373
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,769
First, I'd like to hear...

374
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:56,269
a polite and sincere apology.

375
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:05,950
There's no time.

376
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:15,019
If I go to the station right now,

377
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:18,659
I'll be dying
to put you behind bars.

378
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,739
About that camcorder...

379
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:31,769
It was quite interesting.

380
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:40,179
What?

381
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:49,659
I'm sure it's somewhere.

382
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:53,230
It's just not in his laptop.

383
00:35:34,139 --> 00:35:35,670
This is amazing.

384
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:40,440
Mu Jin, we need to check
and leave soon. Time's ticking.

385
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:44,550
My dad will kill me
if we get caught.

386
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:47,449
Hae Su, you look pretty on camera.

387
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:48,579
Do you want to die?

388
00:35:48,989 --> 00:35:51,119
I told you not to talk casually
to my sister.

389
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:54,420
Come on, my brother-in-law.
Loosen up, will you?

390
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:57,889
- Be quiet. Let's go check.
- Gosh, he's so annoying.

391
00:35:58,329 --> 00:36:00,000
Ghosts don't exist.

392
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,530
I swear I heard something.

393
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:03,900
Tell Mu Jin to go downstairs alone.

394
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:06,170
You're too scared to do that, right?

395
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:08,639
Hey, you just wait here.

396
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:10,539
I'll interview the ghost
and come back.

397
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:12,480
Watch out.

398
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:16,449
All right. Reporter Kim, moving in.

399
00:36:16,809 --> 00:36:17,809
Let's go.

400
00:36:24,489 --> 00:36:25,590
What is this?

401
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,460
That's creepy.

402
00:37:02,889 --> 00:37:03,929
Did you watch it?

403
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:06,730
I'll keep the tape.

404
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,599
If I reveal that tape to the world,

405
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,940
you'll have to quit your job.

406
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,869
Better yet,

407
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:19,610
you'll have to leave the country.

408
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,050
Had you made a different decision
on that day,

409
00:37:28,449 --> 00:37:31,150
the serial murders would've stopped
then and there.

410
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:35,360
How many more victims
did you create?

411
00:37:42,829 --> 00:37:44,300
You must watch that video often.

412
00:37:47,369 --> 00:37:48,440
What is it?

413
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,679
Do you relive that moment...

414
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:56,679
and become excited?

415
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,789
Do you think I'm a monster like you?

416
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,449
So what will it be?

417
00:38:05,619 --> 00:38:08,420
Will you do as I say?

418
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,360
Or shall we destroy
each other's lives?

419
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,210
What do I need to do?

420
00:38:31,449 --> 00:38:32,579
First,

421
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:36,349
I'd like to hear...

422
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:39,190
a polite and sincere apology.

423
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,369
Don't worry about me. I'm fine.

424
00:39:00,179 --> 00:39:01,539
Reporter Kim.

425
00:39:02,849 --> 00:39:05,110
I said,
there was a plausible reason.

426
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:07,820
Wait. He will explain everything.

427
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:10,650
Mr. Kim Mu Jin,
you are under arrest for assault...

428
00:39:10,889 --> 00:39:12,860
in accordance
with Article 206, Clause 1.

429
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,489
Say something, will you?

430
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:15,789
Ji Won.

431
00:39:16,659 --> 00:39:18,190
We've already talked it out.

432
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:21,760
And I started it. It's my fault.

433
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:24,900
I did something wrong
and made him upset.

434
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:26,670
Don't be ridiculous.

435
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,840
At times,
you need to be coldhearted.

436
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:32,139
He kept asking for a freebie
in return for writing an article,

437
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,610
so I got mad.

438
00:39:34,179 --> 00:39:36,510
I had no idea
you two knew each other.

439
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:39,750
I pushed his shoulder
and told him to leave.

440
00:39:40,019 --> 00:39:41,179
It's my fault.

441
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:48,159
You just cursed me in your head,
didn't you?

442
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:50,429
I have a lot to say,

443
00:39:51,329 --> 00:39:52,900
but I have nothing to say.

444
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,630
Let me apologize to you
one more time. Sorry, Reporter Kim.

445
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:00,900
I was too rude.

446
00:40:01,969 --> 00:40:04,070
I would have treated you better...

447
00:40:04,409 --> 00:40:06,010
if I knew
you two were acquaintances.

448
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:09,679
Gosh. Really.

449
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,849
That's really...

450
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:15,050
Reporter Kim. He apologized
to you when he was hit.

451
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:16,849
Shouldn't you apologize to him
for hitting him first?

452
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:23,659
I'm sorry.

453
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,960
Honey, does it hurt a lot?

454
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,800
Let me see your mouth. Open up.

455
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,170
Okay. Here.

456
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:34,400
Why did you come looking for me,
Detective Cha?

457
00:40:36,909 --> 00:40:37,969
Ma'am.

458
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:39,840
Do you know Nam Soon Gil?

459
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,210
Nam Soon Gil
of Soon Gil Chinese Restaurant?

460
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,510
He was murdered early this morning.

461
00:40:53,989 --> 00:40:57,230
Yes, Reporter Kim. I'm Nam Soon Gil.

462
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:01,059
There's something I forgot
to tell you earlier.

463
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,929
You'll be interested to hear this.

464
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:07,000
This is something I heard recently.

465
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:11,269
Do Hyun Su actually did it
with his father.

466
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:13,380
I mean, the serial killing.

467
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,349
Are you surprised?

468
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:20,050
I think I was hypersensitive
because I heard this.

469
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:23,849
(Gimbap)

470
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:30,760
Please call me anytime
if you want to hear it in detail.

471
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:35,969
Reporter Kim.

472
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:39,070
Do... Do Hyun Su.

473
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:42,400
Do Hyun Su is here!

474
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,210
What did I tell you? I told you
he'd come to avenge me!

475
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:52,280
The victim knows the criminal.

476
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:54,420
He called him Do Hyun Su.

477
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,150
Who's Do Hyun Su?

478
00:41:56,619 --> 00:41:58,119
I think you know him.

479
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:01,519
What is this? It looks like
the case will resolve easily.

480
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,659
We just need to catch
that guy named Do Hyun Su.

481
00:42:03,659 --> 00:42:05,929
And Reporter Kim Mu Jin
knows who he is.

482
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:07,360
Reporter Kim.

483
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:12,099
- What?
- I said, who is Do Hyun Su?

484
00:42:15,369 --> 00:42:16,769
Yes.

485
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,440
Yes...

486
00:42:20,739 --> 00:42:23,510
Have you heard of Do Min Seok?

487
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:26,750
Do Min Seok of
the Yeonju Serial Murder Case?

488
00:42:26,849 --> 00:42:27,920
Yes.

489
00:42:28,949 --> 00:42:32,590
Do Hyun Su is the son
of the serial killer Do Min Seok.

490
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:37,929
I wrote an article
about the two of them.

491
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:41,860
I used to live close to Do Min Seok.

492
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,469
Didn't you say Do Hyun Su
killed the village foreman...

493
00:42:44,829 --> 00:42:48,139
and fled town three months
after his father passed away?

494
00:42:49,369 --> 00:42:50,570
Inside Do Hyun Su's bag...

495
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:52,840
- Detective, did you find something?
- Yes. Yes.

496
00:42:54,179 --> 00:42:55,909
was the weapon that was used
to kill the village foreman.

497
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:59,380
I believe he's still wanted
because of that case.

498
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:01,719
Is he still wanted after 18 years?

499
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,250
Is this a long-term cold case?

500
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:08,190
How is he connected to Nam Soon Gil?

501
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:13,099
After reading my article,
Mr. Nam called me...

502
00:43:13,099 --> 00:43:14,929
saying he has something to report.

503
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:18,269
He told me that for about 3 years
starting from 2002 fall,

504
00:43:18,869 --> 00:43:21,300
the two of them worked together
to deliver Chinese food.

505
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:25,570
This is all I know.

506
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,380
I mean it.

507
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:31,750
What did he mean when he said
Do Hyun Su murdered with his father?

508
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:36,719
That's just an urban myth.

509
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:42,519
After Do Min Seok committed suicide,
this rumor just went around.

510
00:43:42,889 --> 00:43:44,389
Why did such a rumor go around?

511
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:46,699
Well...

512
00:43:48,429 --> 00:43:50,969
Because Do Hyun Su
was a little strange.

513
00:43:51,429 --> 00:43:53,599
We didn't know
the exact terminology back then,

514
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:56,070
so we just said he was possessed
by a ghost.

515
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:57,170
What terminology?

516
00:44:00,139 --> 00:44:01,909
Antisocial personality disorder.

517
00:44:01,909 --> 00:44:03,780
Why? What did he do?

518
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:07,780
If anyone got on his nerves,

519
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,079
he'd avenge them.

520
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:12,690
At the time, we thought he'd get
better with age, but he's still...

521
00:44:13,019 --> 00:44:14,590
Yes. My goodness.

522
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,030
"At the time"?

523
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,159
You sound like you know
how he's like now.

524
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:20,360
No, no.

525
00:44:20,659 --> 00:44:23,400
I mean I didn't know I'd meet him
again through a murder case...

526
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,099
I didn't know I'd hear his news.

527
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:38,809
Yes? Okay.

528
00:44:40,619 --> 00:44:42,889
Mr. Nam Soon Gil's wife,
Lee Kang Ok, woke up.

529
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:50,690
It must be difficult,
but I'll ask you one thing.

530
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:55,030
Is there anyone who might
have a grudge against your husband?

531
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,199
Do Hyun Su.

532
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:01,269
Pardon?

533
00:45:01,739 --> 00:45:04,070
He received
threat calls every night.

534
00:45:04,739 --> 00:45:05,809
You're...

535
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:08,579
Do Hyun Su, aren't you?

536
00:45:09,179 --> 00:45:11,880
I clearly remember him
saying "Do Hyun Su".

537
00:45:16,449 --> 00:45:19,719
Do you remember the customer
in a raincoat early this morning?

538
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:23,489
He told me he'd be quick...

539
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:26,699
and asked me
to wait just 30 minutes.

540
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,360
That's why I waited.

541
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:32,469
He got back in about 30 minutes
or so.

542
00:45:33,099 --> 00:45:34,769
Where did he get off?

543
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:36,469
Well...

544
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:39,239
In a residential area in Osung-dong.

545
00:45:39,539 --> 00:45:42,280
"Osung-dong"? Osung-dong...

546
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:45,880
Is that where New Sun Villa is?

547
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:48,019
How did you know that?

548
00:45:48,019 --> 00:45:49,820
Because there are
no security cameras there.

549
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:53,659
I see. I didn't know.

550
00:45:58,659 --> 00:46:01,159
Mr. Park Gyung Chun.
You live alone, don't you?

551
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:03,699
How did you know that?

552
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:06,340
That's the free tumbler you get
when you buy single-portioned...

553
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:07,969
short rib soups
on the shopping channel.

554
00:46:07,969 --> 00:46:10,940
I saw it in passing,
but I remember it.

555
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:16,079
You're really amazing.
How could you connect that?

556
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:17,579
Why are you clapping?

557
00:46:19,349 --> 00:46:21,550
Do you remember anything else?

558
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:25,250
Perhaps the way he talks
or a tattoo?

559
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:26,519
Did he smell like anything?

560
00:46:27,059 --> 00:46:28,760
Perhaps he talked about his job.

561
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:29,989
"His job"?

562
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:33,099
I wonder if this might be helpful.

563
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:38,800
What do you do for a living, sir?

564
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:46,840
He told me he does the same thing
as his father.

565
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:53,480
Dad.

566
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,590
- Yes?
- Are you thinking of egg tarts?

567
00:46:58,389 --> 00:46:59,989
No. Why?

568
00:47:00,389 --> 00:47:01,619
Then why are you smiling?

569
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:06,400
Was I smiling?

570
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,500
Yes.

571
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:13,170
It must be because
this tea tastes good.

572
00:47:16,269 --> 00:47:17,469
You did this one well.

573
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:24,880
I'll be keeping the tape.

574
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:29,750
Gosh.

575
00:47:34,389 --> 00:47:36,260
My body's aching.

576
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:41,829
Home, sweet home.

577
00:47:46,099 --> 00:47:48,699
I'm certain Do Hyun Su
met with Nam Soon Gil yesterday.

578
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:54,710
No way. He's not that evil.

579
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:00,079
I better tell the police.

580
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:06,489
No, forget it.
I'll get locked up again.

581
00:48:07,519 --> 00:48:08,619
Don't do it.

582
00:48:12,429 --> 00:48:13,599
He went instead of me.

583
00:48:14,699 --> 00:48:15,929
What if I get blamed instead?

584
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,170
(Cha Ji Won)

585
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:20,500
(Gangsu Police Station Cha Ji Won)

586
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:21,500
(Ms. Kang)

587
00:48:24,139 --> 00:48:27,039
(Ms. Kang)

588
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:30,309
(The Hanjoogan)

589
00:48:31,809 --> 00:48:34,420
Drink it.
This is top grade kopi luwak.

590
00:48:34,619 --> 00:48:37,019
You know the coffee beans
that come from cat feces, right?

591
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:41,619
The cats that roam freely
ate the beans when they wanted...

592
00:48:41,619 --> 00:48:43,260
and defecated when they wanted.

593
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,159
It's all natural. Drink it.

594
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:53,969
What are you doing?

595
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:56,539
What do you think?
I'm giving you my love.

596
00:48:56,739 --> 00:48:57,809
What?

597
00:48:58,969 --> 00:49:00,639
You're going to release
an exclusive, aren't you?

598
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:03,210
Who? Me?

599
00:49:03,349 --> 00:49:05,010
Come on. Don't be so sly.

600
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:06,780
I already know.

601
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,920
My eyes and ears are everywhere.

602
00:49:14,389 --> 00:49:17,190
Today at three in the morning,
an unidentified armed man...

603
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:19,059
entered a Chinese restaurant
ran by the victim.

604
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:20,630
Before the victim could resist...

605
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:23,570
Hwesin-dong Chinese Restaurant
Murder Case,

606
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:26,199
and the Yeonju Serial Murder Case
from 18 years ago.

607
00:49:26,599 --> 00:49:29,039
I hear you knew the connection
between them.

608
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:30,969
There's something there, right?

609
00:49:31,739 --> 00:49:32,840
Is this a big scoop?

610
00:49:33,539 --> 00:49:35,239
- This is...
- Do you need a team?

611
00:49:35,909 --> 00:49:38,750
- Ms. Kang.
- What? Do you have to act alone?

612
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:42,119
I got involved in this case
by chance.

613
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:43,449
I don't intend on writing...

614
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:45,750
Wait.

615
00:49:46,659 --> 00:49:47,760
Did they say three in the morning?

616
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:56,260
Today at three in the morning,
an unidentified armed man...

617
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:58,369
entered a Chinese restaurant
ran by the victim.

618
00:49:58,369 --> 00:49:59,469
Hyun Su.

619
00:50:00,739 --> 00:50:02,500
I won't tell anyone.

620
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:05,840
I promise.

621
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:12,110
I want security,

622
00:50:12,679 --> 00:50:13,980
not a promise.

623
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:15,550
Do you understand?

624
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:27,030
It wasn't him.

625
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:28,159
What?

626
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,329
- Ma'am.
- What?

627
00:50:31,869 --> 00:50:33,139
I think...

628
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,170
I'm about to come up
with an exclusive.

629
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:45,179
(Refreshing Nurungji Soup
Made with Dried Pollack!)

630
00:50:50,550 --> 00:50:52,119
- Do you want to taste it?
- Yes.

631
00:50:58,289 --> 00:51:00,400
How could it taste so refreshing?

632
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,030
I made the broth with dried pollack.

633
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:04,869
What are you doing?

634
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:07,000
- What?
- Are you hungry?

635
00:51:08,269 --> 00:51:11,610
No, that's just very similar to
what my husband made me.

636
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:12,710
How strange.

637
00:51:13,010 --> 00:51:14,639
That's a pretty common dish.

638
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:18,010
Sorry for making you wait.

639
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:19,980
Please take a seat. This way.

640
00:51:24,619 --> 00:51:28,119
Soon Gil and Hyun Su
worked for me for about three years.

641
00:51:28,159 --> 00:51:31,989
Can we see the bank account
where you wired Do Hyun Su's money?

642
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:34,099
We're urgently looking for him.

643
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:38,599
Actually, Hyun Su didn't have...

644
00:51:38,599 --> 00:51:41,199
any ID on him,
so I paid him in cash.

645
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:43,610
Did you pay him properly?

646
00:51:44,539 --> 00:51:45,739
Of course.

647
00:51:46,510 --> 00:51:49,179
Soon Gil even brought me
10,000 dollars.

648
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:50,550
You can ask him.

649
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,050
10,000 dollars?

650
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:53,820
What do you mean?

651
00:51:54,019 --> 00:51:56,789
Soon Gil said he wanted to learn
how to cook,

652
00:51:56,849 --> 00:51:58,989
so I gave him my recipe
for 10,000 dollars...

653
00:51:58,989 --> 00:52:01,219
and even promised to help him
open up a restaurant.

654
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:02,659
What about Do Hyun Su?

655
00:52:02,889 --> 00:52:04,429
What happened to him?

656
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:07,099
How could he be so ungrateful?

657
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,360
He left without even saying goodbye.

658
00:52:10,199 --> 00:52:13,900
Shall I say he didn't seem like
a normal human being?

659
00:52:14,539 --> 00:52:17,769
One day, I fell down in the hall,
and he laughed.

660
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:20,679
I asked him why he was laughing,

661
00:52:21,610 --> 00:52:24,650
and he said the sound I made
when I fell down was funny.

662
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:26,980
Because Do Hyun Su
was a little strange.

663
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:29,519
We didn't know
the exact terminology back then,

664
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:32,590
so we just said he was possessed
by a ghost.

665
00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:33,820
What terminology?

666
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:36,730
Antisocial personality disorder.

667
00:52:37,389 --> 00:52:38,889
That crazy fool.

668
00:52:39,329 --> 00:52:41,960
I still can't forget...

669
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:44,000
that face of his.

670
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:14,130
- What are you doing?
- I need your money.

671
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:16,969
Darn it!

672
00:53:33,349 --> 00:53:34,519
Hyun Su.

673
00:53:35,619 --> 00:53:36,690
Hyun Su.

674
00:53:37,449 --> 00:53:40,260
I... I must've lost my mind
for a second.

675
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:41,719
Don't kill me.

676
00:53:43,090 --> 00:53:44,659
I'll kill you.

677
00:53:45,329 --> 00:53:47,530
You're not someone
who can do this.

678
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,170
You shouldn't do this.

679
00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:53,199
You still don't know me.

680
00:54:00,039 --> 00:54:01,280
Kill him.

681
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:35,309
Hyun Su.

682
00:54:39,050 --> 00:54:41,280
Kill him.

683
00:55:35,539 --> 00:55:36,809
Dad.

684
00:55:39,010 --> 00:55:41,840
Are you angry I spilled juice?

685
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:47,079
No. I'm not angry.

686
00:55:52,090 --> 00:55:53,119
(Kim Mu Jin)

687
00:55:56,219 --> 00:55:58,829
Eun Ha, can you go to
the living room and watch TV?

688
00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:00,199
I have to take this call.

689
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:01,400
Okay.

690
00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:12,139
What is it?

691
00:56:12,269 --> 00:56:14,880
I'm precious to you
since I can prove your alibi.

692
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,210
What on earth
are you talking about?

693
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:19,250
That's right. You're not the type
to kill someone so brutally.

694
00:56:19,579 --> 00:56:21,880
I've experienced it myself.
That's not like you.

695
00:56:23,349 --> 00:56:25,949
It seems like you're asking
for more, blabbering such nonsense.

696
00:56:26,519 --> 00:56:28,559
Let's meet. I need to talk to you.

697
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:31,630
I told you not to come near me
ever again.

698
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,389
Nam Soon Gil whom you met
yesterday, died.

699
00:56:33,389 --> 00:56:34,699
Doesn't it feel strange?

700
00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:36,400
Why should it feel strange?

701
00:56:37,099 --> 00:56:39,030
Someone who bothered me just died
on his own.

702
00:56:39,269 --> 00:56:41,269
I actually want to celebrate
with some champagne.

703
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:42,670
You really don't know anything?

704
00:56:43,909 --> 00:56:45,909
If you annoy me one more time,

705
00:56:46,409 --> 00:56:48,809
I'll go find you. Do you understand?

706
00:57:12,269 --> 00:57:14,300
Hey, I'm telling you
this is a murder case.

707
00:57:14,869 --> 00:57:16,199
Watch your mouth,
my daughter might hear you.

708
00:57:17,070 --> 00:57:18,739
Who are you, mister?

709
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:21,280
Oh, I'm your dad's friend.

710
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:23,750
We have no time to waste.

711
00:57:26,309 --> 00:57:27,550
Watch this.

712
00:57:27,679 --> 00:57:30,289
Today at three in the morning,
an unidentified armed man...

713
00:57:30,289 --> 00:57:32,250
entered a Chinese restaurant
ran by the victim.

714
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:36,289
Before the victim could resist,
he was attacked brutally.

715
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:39,429
The police have determined Mr. Do,
who used to work with the victim...

716
00:57:39,429 --> 00:57:41,599
as a deliveryman as the suspect...

717
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:44,699
Who do you think Mr. Do is?

718
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,170
The moment Nam Soon Gil died,
he pointed out you...

719
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:52,070
He pointed out Do Hyun Su
as the killer.

720
00:57:52,769 --> 00:57:54,380
Who is Do Hyun Su?

721
00:57:58,610 --> 00:57:59,880
Let's talk outside.

722
00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:06,889
Darn it.

723
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:09,360
What is going on?

724
00:58:10,789 --> 00:58:13,730
Who killed the village foreman
18 years ago?

725
00:58:14,599 --> 00:58:17,429
I told you it was me.
Why are you asking me that now?

726
00:58:18,269 --> 00:58:19,329
What about Nam Soon Gil?

727
00:58:20,869 --> 00:58:21,940
It wasn't me.

728
00:58:23,369 --> 00:58:26,539
Right. Although you may kill,
you don't lie.

729
00:58:26,570 --> 00:58:28,280
You're a very honest scumbag.

730
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,349
What are you trying to pull?

731
00:58:36,349 --> 00:58:39,619
Let go. You need to let go
for me to talk.

732
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:49,900
Do you want to talk in the basement?

733
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:53,800
Nam Soon Gil claimed that
Hyun Su continuously threatened him.

734
00:58:54,170 --> 00:58:56,199
Was it you? Did you do that?

735
00:58:56,340 --> 00:58:57,440
Why would I do such a thing?

736
00:58:58,139 --> 00:58:59,409
Before you and I met,

737
00:58:59,409 --> 00:59:01,079
the thought of him
never crossed my mind.

738
00:59:02,510 --> 00:59:05,110
The killer knows Hyun Su so well
for Soon Gil to mistake them.

739
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:07,650
And Hyun Su must know who it is.

740
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:11,289
Who could it be? Who has
deep-rooted resentment toward you?

741
00:59:11,719 --> 00:59:12,789
Think hard.

742
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,489
I don't know.

743
00:59:17,159 --> 00:59:19,989
You're wrong. It's in your memory.

744
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,469
Look at this.

745
00:59:25,170 --> 00:59:28,070
The "Yeonju Serial Murder Case"
is the most-searched term.

746
00:59:28,769 --> 00:59:30,099
Second is "Do Min Seok's son".

747
00:59:30,099 --> 00:59:31,710
Third is "Chinese restaurant
murder case".

748
00:59:31,809 --> 00:59:33,309
See? It's the talk of the town.

749
00:59:33,710 --> 00:59:36,039
(Yeonju Serial Murder Case,
Do Min Seok's son)

750
00:59:42,619 --> 00:59:44,320
Is this entertaining for you?

751
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:48,159
Hyun Su. I mean, Mr. Baek.

752
00:59:48,889 --> 00:59:52,260
You and I can get to the bottom
of this before anyone else can.

753
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:53,590
This is going to be amazing.

754
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:56,900
"Amazing"? Okay.

755
00:59:58,329 --> 01:00:00,369
- But for whom?
- What?

756
01:00:02,070 --> 01:00:04,940
For you and me.

757
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:06,980
Let's share what we know.

758
01:00:07,809 --> 01:00:10,449
Your name will be cleared,
and I'll get an exclusive.

759
01:00:10,579 --> 01:00:11,780
It'll benefit both of us.

760
01:00:11,949 --> 01:00:13,110
It's a win-win situation.

761
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:16,849
In the heart of Seoul,

762
01:00:16,849 --> 01:00:19,190
a husband in his 40s
who had an expecting wife...

763
01:00:19,219 --> 01:00:21,019
was killed in the same way
as the victims...

764
01:00:21,019 --> 01:00:22,960
of a serial murder case
from 18 years ago.

765
01:00:23,489 --> 01:00:25,460
This has to be solved.

766
01:00:26,489 --> 01:00:29,900
Do you think it'll be that difficult
for the police to find Do Hyun Su?

767
01:00:41,039 --> 01:00:42,440
Who in the world did it?

768
01:00:47,219 --> 01:00:48,250
("Exclusive: A Chinese Restaurant
Owner in His 40s...")

769
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:49,250
("Murdered in Hwesin-dong")

770
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:30,289
- Don't skip your meals.
- Okay. Goodbye.

771
01:01:30,389 --> 01:01:31,489
Goodbye.

772
01:01:31,489 --> 01:01:33,260
The police are doing their best.

773
01:01:33,659 --> 01:01:36,059
Meanwhile, Do,
the key suspect of the murder...

774
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:39,300
of a village foreman in Gagyeong-ri
18 years ago,

775
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:42,869
is still at large
and has shocked the people.

776
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:47,139
Around the time Do Hyun Su
had disappeared in 2005,

777
01:01:47,139 --> 01:01:49,510
Nam Soon Gil suddenly had
10,000 dollars.

778
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:52,980
Until the moment he died,
he was afraid of Hyun Su.

779
01:01:53,409 --> 01:01:55,880
I believe the two
had resentment toward each other...

780
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:57,619
due to money-related issues.

781
01:01:57,619 --> 01:01:58,849
By the way,

782
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:00,960
what's that picture of Hyun Su?

783
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:02,420
It's his middle school
graduation photo.

784
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:06,130
In 2002, Hyun Su was 18
when he killed...

785
01:02:06,130 --> 01:02:07,760
the village foreman and ran away.

786
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:09,559
And he set his house on fire.

787
01:02:10,130 --> 01:02:13,000
I believe he was trying to erase
all of his traces.

788
01:02:13,869 --> 01:02:16,739
Due to his unsociable personality,
he didn't have any friends.

789
01:02:16,739 --> 01:02:18,110
When investigating
the village foreman's murder,

790
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:19,909
the police couldn't get
a single photo of him.

791
01:02:21,079 --> 01:02:22,739
We'll need to get
a facial composite...

792
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:24,079
based on
Mr. Noh Man Sik's description...

793
01:02:24,079 --> 01:02:25,380
since he knows
how Hyun Su looks now.

794
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:26,880
This guy is a ghost.

795
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:29,880
He didn't get an ID card either.

796
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:32,619
He has no records
of using a credit card, a phone,

797
01:02:32,619 --> 01:02:35,190
or a transaction history. Nothing.

798
01:02:35,619 --> 01:02:37,460
How is he living?

799
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:38,559
What about his family?

800
01:02:54,610 --> 01:02:55,739
I'll do it.

801
01:02:59,210 --> 01:03:01,119
Why are they talking about you
on TV?

802
01:03:01,449 --> 01:03:03,989
What are you doing these days?

803
01:03:05,849 --> 01:03:07,420
I'm looking into it.

804
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:09,190
You should be lying low,

805
01:03:09,590 --> 01:03:11,190
so how dare you get involved
in a murder case?

806
01:03:11,630 --> 01:03:12,829
Have you gone insane?

807
01:03:13,059 --> 01:03:14,300
It has nothing to do with me.

808
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:18,099
Had I known you were this sloppy,

809
01:03:18,269 --> 01:03:20,800
I wouldn't have chosen you
to be Baek Hee Seong.

810
01:03:59,110 --> 01:04:00,239
Hee Seong.

811
01:04:22,599 --> 01:04:24,269
(Baek Hee Seong)

812
01:04:24,269 --> 01:04:25,269
(Identity Card Application Form)

813
01:04:28,769 --> 01:04:29,769
(Baek Hee Seong, Do Hyun Su)

814
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:06,170
(Flower of Evil)

815
01:05:06,269 --> 01:05:08,840
I told you! I warned you!

816
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:10,809
The culprit was caught on CCTV...

817
01:05:10,909 --> 01:05:12,510
and left his blood
at the crime scene.

818
01:05:12,510 --> 01:05:13,750
This will get solved.

819
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:16,650
Chasing after Do Hyun Su
won't lead them to Baek Hee Seong.

820
01:05:16,719 --> 01:05:18,719
Do Min Seok had a daughter.

821
01:05:18,719 --> 01:05:20,989
I've never seen Hyun Su
for the past 18 years.

822
01:05:20,989 --> 01:05:22,690
When will you believe me?

823
01:05:22,690 --> 01:05:23,889
You know who Ms. Bok Ja is, right?

824
01:05:23,889 --> 01:05:25,989
She has a photo of you
from five years ago.

825
01:05:26,489 --> 01:05:28,260
The police will visit her soon,

826
01:05:28,630 --> 01:05:29,800
and it'll be Detective Cha herself.

827
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,230
Your wife is on her way
to catch you.

828
01:05:34,469 --> 01:05:35,570
Do Hyun Su!
