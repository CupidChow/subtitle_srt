(Baek Hee Seong)

10
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,010
I can't remember very well.

11
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,150
I wanted to die...

12
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,950
after getting my report card.

13
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,189
I can't...

14
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:29,930
remember after that.

15
00:01:34,629 --> 00:01:35,700
The puppy...

16
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,969
The puppy died because of me, right?

17
00:01:42,709 --> 00:01:43,980
I'm so sorry.

18
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,510
Hee Seong,

19
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,609
will you go wait in the lobby?

20
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,019
I need to speak to your mom.

21
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:05,859
It's...

22
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,400
all my fault.

23
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:12,199
He's normally not like this.

24
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:17,539
He acts strangely whenever
his report card comes out.

25
00:02:39,729 --> 00:02:40,800
Hyun Su.

26
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,000
Do Hyun Su.

27
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,539
Let's go draw together.

28
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:48,669
Here.

29
00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:04,490
It's you, right?

30
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:09,960
The kid who threw a brick
from the rooftop.

31
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,969
Do you know why you did that?

32
00:03:18,669 --> 00:03:19,740
Yes.

33
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:23,680
It's youth depression
caused by academic stress.

34
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:32,550
You were curious about
what would happen, right?

35
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:37,919
Like throwing a stone
into a tranquil pond,

36
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,360
you threw a stone
into your tranquil life.

37
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,659
You wanted to find out...

38
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:48,030
how the world would shake
around you.

39
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,840
Aren't I right?

40
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,979
Why would I do that?

41
00:04:00,979 --> 00:04:02,650
Because you don't know how to play.

42
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:11,219
You've never met someone
like yourself before.

43
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,730
You must've been...

44
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,899
quite lonely.

45
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,300
Do Hyun Su.

46
00:04:59,569 --> 00:05:00,670
He's here.

47
00:05:15,089 --> 00:05:17,860
Why are you here?
We weren't expecting you.

48
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,759
I have something to tell you
and Director Baek.

49
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,959
We're a bit tired today.

50
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,170
You should go back home.

51
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:31,170
I know everything.

52
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:35,939
Everything? What do you mean?

53
00:05:37,009 --> 00:05:38,810
About what happened here.

54
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,149
What?

55
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,550
Do you truly want us to leave?

56
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,180
(Episode 13)

57
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,259
What are you doing?

58
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:34,600
Sit down.

59
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:50,379
You canceled our dinner plan
because of your business trip.

60
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,649
Why are you here all of a sudden?

61
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:56,750
Both of you, at that.

62
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:01,889
Since we were supposed
to meet tonight,

63
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:04,160
I knew you'd be home.

64
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:06,759
How much...

65
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,129
do you know?

66
00:07:10,939 --> 00:07:14,839
How much are you hiding?

67
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:19,180
So you're saying...

68
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:23,350
that you know everything...

69
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,779
about your husband, right?

70
00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:31,759
Despite that, you're here with him.
What does this mean?

71
00:07:32,089 --> 00:07:35,259
Does this mean that you're willing
to accept everything?

72
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:40,870
First of all,

73
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,800
I'd like you to know
I'm on his side no matter what.

74
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:49,639
Okay.

75
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:54,050
I think us four will have...

76
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,379
a lot to talk about tonight.

77
00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:01,319
It's not just four of us.

78
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:05,490
What?

79
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:09,689
There's one more person
in this house.

80
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:14,470
Where is he?

81
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:52,139
(Overseas Medical Volunteer Work
of Ilsin University Hospital)

82
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:06,450
We weren't...

83
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:10,090
on good terms to begin with.

84
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:11,919
Even that day,

85
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,190
we had gotten into an argument
regarding the car accident.

86
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:23,529
Then an unforeseen accident
occurred.

87
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:28,169
Whether he's conscious or not
doesn't matter anymore.

88
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,340
Every time his life was in danger,

89
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,820
we administered medication
in order to keep him alive.

90
00:09:39,049 --> 00:09:40,720
Because of that,
his kidneys have deteriorated.

91
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,289
As of now, he's suffering
from multiple organ failures.

92
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,429
In other words,

93
00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:50,559
it wouldn't be a surprise...

94
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:52,299
if his heart stopped beating
after ten minutes.

95
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,200
We've disclosed...

96
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,809
all our secrets right now.

97
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,110
Let me make a promise.

98
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:07,080
I'm going to make sure...

99
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,409
your husband lives as Baek Hee Seong
until the day he dies.

100
00:10:11,419 --> 00:10:12,419
So...

101
00:10:13,549 --> 00:10:15,889
I hope you won't be worried
about that anymore.

102
00:10:18,789 --> 00:10:19,860
No.

103
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,230
You've misunderstood her.

104
00:10:22,929 --> 00:10:23,929
Misunderstood?

105
00:10:24,129 --> 00:10:27,669
Ji Won just wanted
to confirm the truth...

106
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:30,299
with her own eyes.

107
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,240
We didn't come here...

108
00:10:34,169 --> 00:10:36,909
to make you promise anything.

109
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,679
It's time.

110
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:42,679
To do what?

111
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,279
To reveal...

112
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:49,720
the accomplice's identity.

113
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:16,779
Hide over there.

114
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:53,879
Now, tell us.

115
00:11:56,149 --> 00:12:00,120
Like you wanted,
we've all gathered here.

116
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,259
Don't tell me...

117
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:08,899
you think I know...

118
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,669
who the accomplice is.

119
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:16,409
It's 10pm.

120
00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:19,840
If things went as planned,

121
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:23,549
I would've arrived
at the villa in Gapyeong.

122
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,019
So?

123
00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:33,190
The only people who know
about this are me, Ji Won,

124
00:12:35,429 --> 00:12:36,659
and you.

125
00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:41,669
What are you getting at?

126
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,899
I'm sure you know.

127
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,139
You have your opportunity.

128
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:53,210
You better not fail.

129
00:12:57,049 --> 00:12:58,450
Tonight at 10pm.

130
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,889
- 351 Gyeongjinsan-gil...
- If Yeom Sang Chul is spotted...

131
00:13:01,889 --> 00:13:02,950
at the villa,

132
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:05,659
that would mean
that you were the one...

133
00:13:07,389 --> 00:13:09,159
who tipped him off.

134
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,600
The police are on a stakeout
outside of your villa...

135
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,100
as we speak.

136
00:13:48,269 --> 00:13:49,330
Yeom Sang Chul!

137
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,870
Put down your weapon and
raise your hands when I ask nicely.

138
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:06,750
The day I had a deal
with Yeom Sang Chul,

139
00:14:07,549 --> 00:14:09,120
someone offered him...

140
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:12,789
twice the amount of what I offered
in return for killing me.

141
00:14:14,289 --> 00:14:15,389
The only person...

142
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:18,429
who knew I was dealing
with Yeom Sang Chul that night,

143
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:22,669
and also knew the exact amount
of money I paid him...

144
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:24,740
was you,

145
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,240
the one who prepared
that money for me.

146
00:14:29,809 --> 00:14:33,080
You wanted me to kill
Park Gyung Chun...

147
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,909
and hoped I would leave on my own.

148
00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:39,779
You were afraid...

149
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:44,820
of your identity being exposed,
rather than mine.

150
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:47,759
Because...

151
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:50,889
you are...

152
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:55,129
the accomplice of the
Yeonju Serial Murder Case.

153
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,500
What are you talking about?

154
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:00,840
Sit down.

155
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:03,840
If you show the slightest signs
of violent behavior,

156
00:15:03,909 --> 00:15:06,309
I have no choice but
to fulfill my duty as a detective.

157
00:15:06,909 --> 00:15:07,980
You.

158
00:15:09,549 --> 00:15:12,549
Are you thinking the same thing
as him?

159
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:16,419
The moment we confirm your
relation with Yeom Sang Chul,

160
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:18,590
you'll have to come with me
to the police station.

161
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,659
What?

162
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:30,500
(Detective Choi)

163
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:44,450
Yes, Detective Choi.

164
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,879
It seems like you were wrong.

165
00:15:47,889 --> 00:15:49,950
I'm just the keeper of this villa.

166
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:52,789
Director Baek told me his son
would be coming to work tonight,

167
00:15:52,789 --> 00:15:55,490
and asked me to make sure
his stay was comfortable.

168
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,460
I just brought those scissors
to cut some branches...

169
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,360
while I was here.

170
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:07,600
Yes.

171
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,370
I understand.

172
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,549
I cannot believe...

173
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:24,049
this situation.

174
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:31,129
How could you suspect me
as a serial murderer?

175
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:38,370
What did Detective Choi say?

176
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,370
He said Director Baek sent
a keeper to the villa.

177
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,240
So he could tend to me all night.

178
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,120
I guess I have...

179
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,019
underestimated you.

180
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,130
It isn't me.

181
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:13,400
Hyun Su.

182
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,069
It isn't me.

183
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,480
There's no other possibility...

184
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,480
besides you.

185
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,619
How can I prove that it isn't me?

186
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:28,789
Ji Won.

187
00:17:31,859 --> 00:17:34,289
Can you be doing this
as a detective?

188
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:38,799
You have no proof whatsoever,
yet you're threatening me...

189
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,900
by using your authority
as a detective.

190
00:17:44,269 --> 00:17:47,839
You just pointed me out
as the culprit,

191
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,579
and is now trying to force
the pieces of the puzzle together.

192
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,210
No.

193
00:17:57,579 --> 00:17:59,279
This whole situation...

194
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:02,319
is telling me
that you're the culprit.

195
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,359
I'm certain.

196
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:08,089
It's me.

197
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:20,700
The person you're looking for is me.

198
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:37,960
From now on,

199
00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:41,589
you'll be playing...

200
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,359
the game I've prepared for you,

201
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,000
Do Hyun Su.

202
00:18:56,339 --> 00:18:59,140
It was me who leaked our secret.

203
00:19:00,609 --> 00:19:01,880
What do you mean?

204
00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:03,980
Leaked what secret?

205
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,079
It rained this afternoon,

206
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,579
and I guess the circuit breaker
switched off.

207
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,119
Let me go check.

208
00:20:02,539 --> 00:20:03,710
You have your opportunity.

209
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:07,779
Tonight at 10pm, at my villa.

210
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,079
It's me, Baek Hee Seong.

211
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:16,089
Cut the chitchat.

212
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,119
Just answer my question honestly.

213
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,289
Did you ever...

214
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:24,230
leak our information...

215
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,700
to Do Hyun Su?

216
00:20:27,099 --> 00:20:28,869
Do you think I'm crazy?
Why would I...

217
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:36,140
Did you?

218
00:20:38,509 --> 00:20:40,140
I didn't tell him directly.

219
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:44,210
I just mentioned that someone
paid me to kill him.

220
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:47,680
Mr. Yeom.

221
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:51,019
Don't do...

222
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:53,359
anything from now on.

223
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:56,460
Know your place.

224
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,230
What did you say?

225
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,900
I don't need you anymore.

226
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:05,440
What do you think you're doing?

227
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:10,940
Do Hyun Su set a trap.

228
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,410
To kill two birds with one stone.

229
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,950
A trap?

230
00:21:16,049 --> 00:21:17,109
Think about it.

231
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:20,720
Who is the one that made
the golden opportunity...

232
00:21:21,049 --> 00:21:22,250
to kill Do Hyun Su?

233
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:27,660
We're just being played like fools
in a game that he made.

234
00:21:28,589 --> 00:21:29,589
It's obvious.

235
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:35,700
The moment Yeom Sang Chul
arrives at the villa,

236
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,400
you'll go down too.

237
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,900
That's what he wanted to check.

238
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,769
Then...

239
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:46,910
we should stop Yeom Sang Chul
from going to the villa.

240
00:21:47,109 --> 00:21:49,349
Then it won't be a problem.

241
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:53,680
That won't stop him
from doubting me.

242
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,289
That's the kind of person
Do Hyun Su is.

243
00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:58,589
Wait.

244
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:02,960
That means he doesn't have
any proof yet.

245
00:22:09,099 --> 00:22:10,730
Let's get ready to receive
some guests.

246
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,539
What do you mean?

247
00:22:14,869 --> 00:22:17,309
Since he doesn't have proof,
he'll try to corner you...

248
00:22:18,009 --> 00:22:19,509
and make you confess.

249
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:23,309
If Do Hyun Su wants to play
like this,

250
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:28,150
we should prepare a gift as well.

251
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,940
(I want to quit. Thank you for being
warm to me all this time...)

252
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,220
I thought the caregiver
couldn't talk...

253
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,519
because of a hearing impairment.

254
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:04,450
The accomplice talked
with Yeom Sang Chul on the phone.

255
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,789
Relating the caregiver with
Do Min Seok or Yeom Sang Chul...

256
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:10,390
is too far-fetched.

257
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:15,029
What I want to say is
that the secret...

258
00:23:15,029 --> 00:23:16,569
has already been leaked.

259
00:23:17,069 --> 00:23:20,140
There may be someone else
who made a mistake like me.

260
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,809
What about that reporter?

261
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,880
He knows your secret too.

262
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:28,380
- So does your sister.
- Mother.

263
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:32,180
You are...

264
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,789
trying to protect Director Baek
right now.

265
00:23:35,589 --> 00:23:37,690
- Am I right?
- No.

266
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,059
I swear that's not true.

267
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:42,029
No.

268
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:45,099
I'm sure you know something
right now.

269
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:48,970
What is it?

270
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,170
Don't you trust me?

271
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:01,579
Why should I trust you?

272
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,289
Right.

273
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,089
There's no reason
for you to believe me.

274
00:24:16,029 --> 00:24:19,099
I'll switch off the circuit breaker.

275
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:24,470
When the blackout happens,
Dad, you can make it an excuse...

276
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,670
to look at the breaker to earn time.

277
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:31,140
In the meantime,
Mom can take out some candles.

278
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,380
It must be taking him long.

279
00:24:39,819 --> 00:24:41,019
I better light some candles.

280
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:53,000
Something's off.

281
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:56,869
What is?

282
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:00,769
Something's bugging me,

283
00:25:02,069 --> 00:25:03,609
but I'm not sure what it is.

284
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:05,539
Gosh!

285
00:25:15,089 --> 00:25:16,089
Are you okay?

286
00:25:18,019 --> 00:25:19,160
I'm okay.

287
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:32,670
Hyun Su.

288
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:39,210
I thought of you
as my son until now.

289
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:42,049
I was sincere about that.

290
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:57,390
No matter how you thought of me,

291
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,400
there was never a time...

292
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:06,299
I was curious about
your true feelings.

293
00:26:41,569 --> 00:26:43,509
Shouldn't you check on your son?

294
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:46,210
What? Why?

295
00:26:46,579 --> 00:26:48,880
All medical equipment
rely on electricity.

296
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:52,579
He must be in a dangerous state
right now.

297
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:57,019
Well... I mean...

298
00:26:57,019 --> 00:26:58,890
There are backup batteries,
so it's okay.

299
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,759
With those,
we're good up to six hours.

300
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,299
What are you doing? Let's sit down.

301
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,470
Let's finish
what we were talking about.

302
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:09,250
I'm sorry.

303
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:12,759
Ever since fourth grade
when I had first seen you,

304
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:14,819
my feelings have never changed.

305
00:29:18,029 --> 00:29:20,230
How can he still have this...

306
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,170
like a fool?

307
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:42,049
It'd be best if you don't
personally get involved now.

308
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:46,880
I don't want you to keep on
getting more enemies.

309
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:50,619
Whether Director Baek Man Woo
is the culprit or not,

310
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:53,920
he'll start to be hostile
towards you starting today.

311
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,460
Leave it to the police now.

312
00:30:59,299 --> 00:31:02,369
I better meet with that caregiver.

313
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:05,200
Didn't you hear what I just said?

314
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:07,700
Mother's right too.

315
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:11,339
We don't know how much
the caregiver knows,

316
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,339
and how much the secret leaked.

317
00:31:14,309 --> 00:31:15,450
I need to check.

318
00:31:15,509 --> 00:31:18,779
I said, it's not a good idea
for you to be involved.

319
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:21,650
I want to get out
of this situation...

320
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:25,089
as fast as possible.

321
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:32,529
He's a serial murderer.
Someone who enjoys killing.

322
00:31:34,029 --> 00:31:35,130
It means someone like that...

323
00:31:36,329 --> 00:31:37,930
is around me.

324
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,440
I'm afraid his malice...

325
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,309
will reach...

326
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:47,309
you, me, and even Eun Ha.

327
00:31:49,509 --> 00:31:50,809
Whenever I think about that,

328
00:31:54,619 --> 00:31:55,720
it scares me.

329
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:14,900
Guess what our station's arrest rate
is for murder cases this year.

330
00:32:18,109 --> 00:32:19,309
It's 120 percent.

331
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:25,519
We caught someone this year
we couldn't last year.

332
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,549
We catch every single person
if they killed anyone.

333
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:35,730
As long as we catch Yeom Sang Chul,
we'll be successful...

and evidence.

Don't be afraid.

Once they get caught,

338
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:52,910
you'll be ashamed of the fact...

339
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:54,440
that you were once afraid
of such a loser.

340
00:32:56,079 --> 00:32:58,579
We're stronger than them, okay?

341
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:09,630
It's strange.

342
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:12,660
Every time you say something,

343
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:15,230
I can't help but believe it.

Soon.

348
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:34,819
Should I count to ten?

349
00:33:37,089 --> 00:33:38,720
Wait for just ten minutes.

350
00:33:39,789 --> 00:33:41,859
That means you're not close.

351
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:43,529
You're still far away.

352
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:47,160
No, we'll be there soon.

353
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,799

She has no family,
so it won't be difficult.

Have you forgotten all the money
I've paid you up until now?

That's for watching her.

Hello. I'm sorry for calling
so late at night.

00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:30,369
I was wondering if I could check
your dashcam footage.

I'm currently on a vacation.

Are you Mr. Baek Hee Seong?

Your wife's name is Cha Ji Won.

She's a violent crimes detective
from Gangsu Police Station.

Am I right?

412
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:00,030
Do you know why he died?

413
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:02,829

I'm sorry.

419

Don't come here.

- Yes.

426
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,869
Here.

00:41:43,269 --> 00:41:44,269
How pretty.

428
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:48,179
Dad, where did you go last night?

429
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:52,519
- What?
- I woke up and went to pee.

430

Well...

434
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:08,400
You're getting a call.
Answer that first.

435

Okay.

Okay.

440
00:42:22,679 --> 00:42:24,079
Good luck, Mom.

441
00:42:25,949 --> 00:42:27,579
But that's not our jurisdiction.

442
00:42:28,849 --> 00:42:30,889
Okay, I'll go to the scene
immediately.

443
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,059
Eun Ha, look at me.

444
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:42,699
Have you ever talked with
a stranger lately?

445
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:44,130
No.

446
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,969
You didn't even think about it.

447
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:51,510
No.

00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:55,739
The "Don't Follow Strangers Rule".

449
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:59,010
"I will never follow a stranger."

450
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:02,449
"An adult never asks a child
for help."

451
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:06,320
"Dad, Mom, and Grandma
will never ask someone else..."

452
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:09,530
"to come pick me up."

453
00:43:12,929 --> 00:43:14,059
Good job.

454
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,570
Dad, my stomach growled again.

455
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:19,000
Did you hear it?

456
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,539
Let me hear it.

457
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:27,780
- Do you want some egg soup?
- Yes!

458
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:29,679
- We were collecting trash.
- Yes.

459
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:31,179
- And I found a scarf.
- I see.

460
00:43:31,179 --> 00:43:33,349
But it seemed stuck in the ground.

461
00:43:33,349 --> 00:43:34,679
So I pulled on it...

462
00:43:35,019 --> 00:43:36,250
And it was a body?

463
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:38,190
- Yes.
- Thank you very much.

464
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:39,920
- You're here.
- Jae Seop.

465
00:43:40,989 --> 00:43:43,130
I'm really sorry about yesterday.

466
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:47,159
Let's talk about that later. Come.

467
00:43:48,099 --> 00:43:50,500
- Did you hear about the body?
- Yes.

468
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:55,199
I'm Producer Woo Han Soo
of "Uncovering the Case".

469
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:57,670
I enjoy watching your program.

470
00:43:58,269 --> 00:44:00,409
- Why don't we sit and talk?
- Okay.

471
00:44:03,079 --> 00:44:04,510
I'll cut to the chase.

472
00:44:05,449 --> 00:44:06,650
I came to invite you as our
panel member.

473
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:10,619
Me? Why?

474
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:12,519
It's because of that live broadcast.

475
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:15,860
Mr. Kim, that was really awesome.

476
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:18,559
Really?

477
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:20,500
The exclusive about the
accomplice's voice...

478
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:22,699
to the stakeout regarding
the human trafficking gang lately.

479

How can you always be
one step ahead of the police?

480
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:32,110
Well, I always try my best,
and I have very good informants.

481
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:35,780
And whenever I read my fortune,
I have great luck with connections.

482
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,519
A body has been found
in a mountain in Makmun-dong.

483
00:44:42,449 --> 00:44:44,190
I think you should go, Mr. Kim.

484
00:44:44,949 --> 00:44:46,019
Me?

485
00:44:46,219 --> 00:44:47,820
Why should he go?

486
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,190
The victim's left thumb fingernail
is removed.

487
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:58,269
Her left thumb fingernail
is removed.

488
00:44:58,969 --> 00:45:00,440
How are we supposed to take this as?

489
00:45:01,139 --> 00:45:03,210
It happened right after
Yeom Sang Chul escaped.

490
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:04,769
He's provoking us for sure.

491
00:45:05,809 --> 00:45:06,880
One thing's for certain.

492
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,340
He's trying to interfere
with our investigation.

493
00:45:10,849 --> 00:45:12,880
- Did you find out who she is?
- Not yet.

494
00:45:13,449 --> 00:45:16,090
Since there is no wallet, bag,
or phone near her,

495
00:45:16,349 --> 00:45:18,250
we can assume she was killed
somewhere else and brought here.

496
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,329
What is that?

497
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:31,269
What do you mean?

498
00:45:31,869 --> 00:45:33,639
It might not be
Director Baek Man Woo?

499
00:45:34,969 --> 00:45:37,469
When you were meeting
him last night,

500
00:45:38,909 --> 00:45:41,679
someone was secretly watching me.

501
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:56,530
Did you call the police?

502
00:45:57,659 --> 00:46:01,360
But nothing has happened yet,
so there's nothing they can do.

503
00:46:05,099 --> 00:46:06,199
Actually,

504
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:09,510
I received a strange call
last night too.

505
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:11,369
A strange call?

506
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:13,440
Yes.

507
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,079
I'm certain it wasn't
Director Baek Man Woo.

508
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:19,780
But...

509
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:23,250
Whenever I think about that voice,

510
00:46:24,289 --> 00:46:27,219
it reminds me of the accomplice's
voice Mu Jin revealed.

511
00:46:32,829 --> 00:46:34,000
Did you hear it or not?

512
00:46:35,329 --> 00:46:36,469
Hear what?

513
00:46:36,469 --> 00:46:39,329
The body that was found
in the mountain this morning.

514
00:46:43,369 --> 00:46:44,710
Her left thumb fingernail
is missing.

515
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:10,869
(I never told anyone.
I have no one to talk to anyway.)

516
00:47:10,969 --> 00:47:13,869
(How can you be so rude?
Don't ever touch me again.)

517
00:47:14,139 --> 00:47:17,309
(If you do this again, I'll tell
the director and his wife.)

518
00:47:17,309 --> 00:47:20,110
These were the last messages
that were found in her notebook.

519
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:22,239
It seems like a conversation...

520
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:24,280
that took place
right before she was killed.

521
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:25,679
Does that really belong
to the victim?

522
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,750
We only found her fingerprints
on the notebook.

523
00:47:28,849 --> 00:47:30,489
If it's a conversation between
the culprit...

524
00:47:30,489 --> 00:47:32,119
and the victim who had
a hearing impairment,

525
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:34,260
that means they knew each other.

526
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:35,889
(Contents of notebook)

527
00:47:36,489 --> 00:47:39,860
Who do you think "the director"
and "his wife" is?

528
00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:44,199
Yes, sir.

529
00:47:45,869 --> 00:47:48,369
Oh, yes. Hold on.
They confirmed her identity.

530
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:52,940
Seoul, Makmun-gu, Makmun-2 dong?

531
00:47:53,409 --> 00:47:56,250
Jangmi Villa unit 303,
Park Soon Young?

532
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:00,119
What? Okay.

533
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,119
They found fingerprints from the
tape the victim was tied up with.

534
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:07,159
The tape that was used
for the crime?

535
00:48:07,619 --> 00:48:10,559
- Then it's a no-brainer.
- I know.

536
00:48:11,289 --> 00:48:14,059
Did they check?
Have they confirmed the identity?

537
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:15,559
They're running it through
AFIS right now.

538
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:18,630
As soon as they get the results,
the inspector will check it himself.

539
00:48:18,699 --> 00:48:20,039
Detective Cha and Detective Im,

540
00:48:20,039 --> 00:48:21,969
go to Forensics
and wait for the results.

541
00:48:21,969 --> 00:48:23,670
Move as soon as the results are out.

542
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,110
Detective Choi,

543
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,780
- go to Park Soon Young's home.
- Yes, sir.

544
00:48:30,849 --> 00:48:34,079
(If you do this again, I'll tell
the director and his wife.)

545
00:48:37,849 --> 00:48:39,659
("Body Found in Mountain
in Makmun-dong")

546
00:48:43,289 --> 00:48:45,590
(The police is investigating after
finding a body this morning...)

547
00:48:51,329 --> 00:48:52,400
Sir.

548
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:57,269
These are the applications
for the medical volunteer team.

549
00:48:57,570 --> 00:48:59,809
From 1999 to 2002.

550
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:01,780
Okay, thank you.

551
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:11,619
The fingerprints have not been
registered?

552
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:14,389
No. It's not even
a partial fingerprint.

553
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,659
It's a clean fingerprint
with distinctive features,

554
00:49:17,659 --> 00:49:19,489
yet our system can't make a match.

555
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:21,860
That means it's not on our database.

556
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:26,539
Does that mean the culprit
doesn't have an identification card?

557
00:49:26,539 --> 00:49:29,639
Right. He may be under 17,

558
00:49:29,639 --> 00:49:32,639
or someone who just wanders
around with no fixed address,

559
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:35,039
without any identification.

560
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:38,210
That's why the culprit
must've been sloppy...

561
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:40,079
when cleaning his fingerprints.

562
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:44,650
I knew it. Things seemed to be going
too smoothly.

563
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:54,960
Yes, Jae Seop.

564
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,300
You really don't know anything
about Park Soon Young?

565
00:49:59,469 --> 00:50:00,500
Why?

566
00:50:01,099 --> 00:50:03,739
Park Soon Young was a caregiver.

567
00:50:05,110 --> 00:50:06,639
Don't you want to know
where she worked at?

568
00:50:11,909 --> 00:50:14,980
Is it...

569
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:19,050
Yes. The home of Baek Man Woo,
the director of Ilsin Hospital.

570
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:20,519
Your in-laws' place.

571
00:50:25,159 --> 00:50:28,699
Dad, where did you go last night?

572
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:32,070
I better meet with that caregiver.

573
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:40,380
I'll call you later.

574
00:50:41,909 --> 00:50:43,880
Ho Joon, give me the car key.

575
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,349
What? Why?

576
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:47,679
I need to check something urgently.

577
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:09,769
The prank call this morning
was from Do Min Seok's accomplice?

578
00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:12,070
Are you sure?

579
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:14,510
I think so.

580
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:17,880
Why would he call you?

581
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:22,019
He also gave me
Jung Mi Sook's fish keychain.

582
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:26,090
I can feel his obsession with me.

583
00:51:27,989 --> 00:51:31,360
But why did he suddenly appear
like this?

584
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:33,760
After 18 years?

585
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:36,929
Serial murderers can never stop
killing on their own.

586
00:51:38,369 --> 00:51:42,000
Maybe he didn't commit murders
because he couldn't for 18 years.

587
00:51:42,769 --> 00:51:45,210
For instance, he could've been
in prison...

588
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:47,380
like the culprit of the
Hwaseong Serial Murder Case.

589
00:51:52,449 --> 00:51:53,579
Look into it.

590
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,380
If there's anyone who was
arrested right after 2002,

591
00:51:57,050 --> 00:51:58,219
and released recently.

592
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,019
Okay.

593
00:52:02,489 --> 00:52:03,590
Hae Su,

594
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:06,360
you should stay at
Mu Jin's place for the time being.

595
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:08,829
Until you feel safe.

596
00:52:14,199 --> 00:52:15,769
You saw the culprit's face.

597
00:52:16,739 --> 00:52:18,739
You may be his next target.

598
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:26,679
Mu Jin, promise me.

599
00:52:28,579 --> 00:52:30,519
That you'll never leave her alone.

600
00:52:33,659 --> 00:52:35,159
Yes. I promise.

601
00:52:40,829 --> 00:52:44,030
I'm going to meet Yeom Sang Chul.

602
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:46,900
What?

603
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:51,170
I'll approach him
through Yeom Sang Chul.

604
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:05,190
Step over it.

605
00:53:20,969 --> 00:53:23,170
Come in. Sit down.

606
00:53:37,219 --> 00:53:40,590
Can I really meet my family here?

607
00:53:43,329 --> 00:53:44,659
Do you not remember anything at all?

608
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:48,360
Nothing at all?

609
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:50,829
I just...

610
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,070
remember walking endlessly.

611
00:54:02,579 --> 00:54:05,050
I didn't even know
why I was walking.

612
00:54:06,849 --> 00:54:08,849
I was just walking.

613
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:13,719
After that,

614
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:17,559
I was sent here and there...

615
00:54:17,559 --> 00:54:19,590
before I was sent to the hospital.

616
00:54:22,659 --> 00:54:25,329
You have such a bitter life too.

617
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:29,639
Thank you...

618
00:54:31,309 --> 00:54:33,309
for finding my family for me.

619
00:54:33,639 --> 00:54:34,840
You don't have to thank me.

620
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:37,510
I'm earning money for this.

621
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:40,619
Jung Mi Sook.

622
00:54:42,519 --> 00:54:43,920
You're a very important person.

623
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:48,360
To all of us.

624
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,329
(Fingerprint Sample)

625
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:12,239
(Fingerprint Sample)

626
00:56:23,719 --> 00:56:27,090
(Mom)

627
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:34,230
Mom, it's me.

628
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:40,570
Hee Seong can't pick
Eun Ha up today.

629
00:56:44,239 --> 00:56:46,010
Can I ask you to go instead?

630
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:03,860
The body was found.

631
00:57:07,829 --> 00:57:09,630
The police will contact you soon.

632
00:57:12,130 --> 00:57:13,539
Just keep on doing well...

633
00:57:15,139 --> 00:57:16,440
as you have until now.

634
00:57:57,409 --> 00:58:01,050
Mom, you're not weak at all.

635
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:06,550
You gave birth to me,

636
00:58:08,090 --> 00:58:09,690
killed me,

637
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:13,429
then brought me back to life.

638
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:20,639
To me, you're like a deity.

639
00:58:58,309 --> 00:59:01,510
No, you can't meet Yeom Sang Chul.

640
00:59:02,179 --> 00:59:03,750
He's trying to kill you.

641
00:59:03,849 --> 00:59:04,880
Exactly.

642
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:07,750
He won't be able to ignore my call.

643
00:59:08,449 --> 00:59:10,449
He has to kill me to get paid.

644
00:59:11,219 --> 00:59:12,920
Isn't it too dangerous?

645
00:59:14,219 --> 00:59:15,690
Once I drag him out,

646
00:59:16,519 --> 00:59:18,429
I'll be able
to get the police's help.

647
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:04,610
Yeom Sang Chul?

648
01:00:07,079 --> 01:00:08,079
I'm...

649
01:00:09,309 --> 01:00:11,610
Jung Mi Sook.

650
01:00:14,619 --> 01:00:16,650
Are you my family?

651
01:00:17,949 --> 01:00:20,389
What did you say your name was?

652
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:23,119
"Jung Mi Sook"?

653
01:00:24,030 --> 01:00:25,059
Yes.

654
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:29,659
The man went to the washroom
just a bit ago.

655
01:00:29,659 --> 01:00:32,400
Where... Where are you right now?

656
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:40,679
I see a lot of trees.

657
01:00:46,449 --> 01:00:47,519
Hello?

658
01:00:58,260 --> 01:01:01,429
The phone is turned off. Please
leave a message after the beep.

659
01:01:10,099 --> 01:01:12,440
(Where the Morning Star Hovers)

660
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:18,079
You're here.

661
01:01:24,489 --> 01:01:26,420
Where did you go last night?

662
01:01:27,690 --> 01:01:28,760
What?

663
01:01:30,929 --> 01:01:32,159
Did you go to Makmun-dong?

664
01:01:37,369 --> 01:01:38,599
How...

665
01:01:39,699 --> 01:01:41,000
did you know that?

666
01:01:47,110 --> 01:01:50,380
A body was found
in one of the mountains there.

667
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:53,309
The victim's name
was Park Soon Young.

668
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:57,420
She was deaf
and was working as a housekeeper.

669
01:01:58,449 --> 01:02:00,889
She took care
of an unconscious patient.

670
01:02:05,429 --> 01:02:07,059
Her employer...

671
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:11,599
was Director Baek Man Woo.

672
01:02:16,469 --> 01:02:18,510
We found the killer's print
on the tape...

673
01:02:23,309 --> 01:02:24,909
that was used to tie her.

674
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:30,320
And it belonged...

675
01:02:37,059 --> 01:02:38,090
to you.

676
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:50,710
What time did Ms. Park leave
yesterday?

677
01:02:54,809 --> 01:02:56,409
It was around 7:30pm.

678
01:02:58,150 --> 01:02:59,610
She was feeling ill,

679
01:03:00,309 --> 01:03:01,849
so I even called a cab for her.

680
01:03:19,329 --> 01:03:21,099
We need the camera
in the alleyway...

681
01:03:22,099 --> 01:03:24,909
to record Park Soon Young
leaving our house.

682
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:28,239
You just need to take the cab...

683
01:03:29,210 --> 01:03:31,210
and get off in front of her house.

684
01:03:32,710 --> 01:03:33,849
Simple, right?

685
01:03:37,619 --> 01:03:40,349
(I never told anyone.
I have no one to talk to anyway.)

686
01:03:41,090 --> 01:03:43,090
This was the last thing
she had written.

687
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:45,530
We believe she was speaking
to the killer.

688
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:56,469
(I never told anyone.
I have no one to talk to anyway.)

689
01:03:59,469 --> 01:04:02,539
(If you do this again, I'll tell
the director and his wife.)

690
01:04:02,539 --> 01:04:05,579
She wrote
"The director and his wife".

691
01:04:05,579 --> 01:04:08,320
By "his wife", she meant you, right?

692
01:04:10,719 --> 01:04:11,750
Yes.

693
01:04:11,750 --> 01:04:14,119
It seems like you and the killer
know each other.

694
01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:17,190
Does anyone come to mind?

695
01:04:27,269 --> 01:04:28,269
Ms. Gong?

696
01:04:34,409 --> 01:04:35,409
Yes.

697
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:38,349
There's someone.

698
01:04:40,150 --> 01:04:41,150
Just one.

699
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:45,650
Ho Joon, are you with Ji Won
right now?

700
01:04:45,650 --> 01:04:48,920
After talking with you on the phone,
her face turned pale.

701
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:50,420
She left,
saying she had to check something.

702
01:04:51,889 --> 01:04:54,760
If you get in touch with her,
call me first.

703
01:04:55,059 --> 01:04:56,429
Did something happen to her?

704
01:04:57,099 --> 01:04:58,400
You know something, don't you?

705
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:05,639
Jae Seop, what are you
and Detective Cha hiding?

706
01:05:06,670 --> 01:05:08,739
I've reached my limit
of feigning ignorance.

707
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:11,510
Jae Seop.

708
01:05:12,380 --> 01:05:13,710
Tell me.

709
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:21,760
Captain. I'm afraid...

710
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:26,690
I'll have to tell you something
that'll be hard to believe.

711
01:05:40,070 --> 01:05:41,139
Are you telling me...

712
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:44,780
to believe that?

713
01:05:48,519 --> 01:05:49,579
How...

714
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:56,719
How is Detective Cha's husband
Do Hyun Su?

715
01:06:04,570 --> 01:06:07,099
- It wasn't me.
- Let's go to the station.

716
01:06:08,070 --> 01:06:10,840
- I said, it wasn't me.
- Come with me to the station...

717
01:06:12,110 --> 01:06:13,670
and reveal the truth.

718
01:06:14,179 --> 01:06:15,280
I'm...

719
01:06:16,510 --> 01:06:17,809
We're going to do our best...

720
01:06:17,809 --> 01:06:19,349
so that you won't be
wrongfully accused.

721
01:06:27,219 --> 01:06:28,489
Since you've become...

722
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:32,460
a suspect for a murder case,

723
01:06:34,829 --> 01:06:36,530
I must carry out
an immediate arrest.

724
01:06:40,530 --> 01:06:42,400
I need to cuff you.

725
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:47,809
Please cooperate with me.

726
01:06:57,820 --> 01:06:58,849
Please.

727
01:07:53,769 --> 01:07:54,840
I truly loved...

728
01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:57,750
your mom.

729
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:09,590
And I believed she loved me too.

730
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:15,929
But what she loved was my illusion.

731
01:08:17,029 --> 01:08:19,300
She couldn't accept my true self.

732
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:25,239
In the end, she abandoned you guys
and me as well.

733
01:08:30,039 --> 01:08:31,079
Love...

734
01:08:32,250 --> 01:08:34,010
is cunning.

735
01:08:35,579 --> 01:08:36,619
It's very crafty.

736
01:08:37,649 --> 01:08:40,649
It makes you think
that it's the answer to everything.

737
01:08:41,890 --> 01:08:43,989
Then it leaves you feeling betrayed.

738
01:08:47,130 --> 01:08:50,060
Hyun Su, remember this.

739
01:08:53,029 --> 01:08:56,970
If you ever feel the desire
to trust someone,

740
01:08:58,109 --> 01:09:01,479
that's proof of you becoming weak.

741
01:09:02,609 --> 01:09:04,710
Nothing more, nothing less.

742
01:09:18,359 --> 01:09:19,390
Honey.

743
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:32,909
Tell me.

744
01:09:35,810 --> 01:09:36,909
Do you trust me?

745
01:09:40,210 --> 01:09:42,220
- What?
- Or...

746
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,720
do you have the slightest doubt...

747
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:50,359
that I may have killed her?

748
01:09:57,300 --> 01:09:58,899
If you don't believe me,

749
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:03,899
then who on earth will?

750
01:10:12,649 --> 01:10:14,449
- Hey, Jae Seop.
- Where are you?

751
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:18,090
I'm at our workshop.

752
01:10:19,949 --> 01:10:21,489
I'm with my husband.

753
01:10:25,289 --> 01:10:26,789
I'll bring him to the police...

754
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:48,649
What...

755
01:10:50,149 --> 01:10:51,189
are you doing?

756
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:55,359
I refuse to trust anyone...

757
01:10:57,989 --> 01:10:59,390
from now on.

758
01:11:30,789 --> 01:11:31,890
The CCTV camera.

759
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:33,390
Check the CCTV footage.

760
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,000
There.

761
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:48,710
Hold on.

762
01:12:06,029 --> 01:12:07,359
Walk toward the monitor.

763
01:12:29,979 --> 01:12:33,020
Take out all the video cables
plugged into the recorder.

764
01:12:34,250 --> 01:12:35,289
Four in total.

765
01:13:30,579 --> 01:13:34,979
(Flower of Evil)

766
01:13:35,250 --> 01:13:36,250
What's most important is that...

767
01:13:36,250 --> 01:13:38,390
one of our detectives
is being held hostage.

768
01:13:39,289 --> 01:13:41,960
No matter how much Do Hyun Su
pleads his innocence,

769
01:13:42,689 --> 01:13:44,630
it's a fact that he's being
wanted for murder.

770
01:13:45,029 --> 01:13:46,560
Do Hyun Su is already guilty.

771
01:13:47,689 --> 01:13:50,800
Do you think it will go along
as we planned?

772
01:13:51,470 --> 01:13:53,000
We'll meet again soon.

773
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:55,100
Don't look at me like
you'll never see me again...

774
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:56,239
and wish me luck.

775
01:13:56,569 --> 01:13:58,539
I didn't want to do this either.

776
01:13:59,439 --> 01:14:01,039
But you concern me.

777
01:14:01,409 --> 01:14:03,310
You're just too unpredictable.
