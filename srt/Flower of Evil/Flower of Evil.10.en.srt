Hee Seong, I passed!

What?

12
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,239
I passed. I passed!

13
00:01:13,609 --> 00:01:14,680
Really?

14
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,150
I'm a police officer now.

15
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:19,420
Are you that happy?

16
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,989
Yes.

17
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,560
I'm so happy
my heart is about to explode.

18
00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:25,659
Are you happy too?

19
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:27,590
Of course.

20
00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:32,359
Hey. Mom told me earlier...

21
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:34,400
that my childhood dream
was to become a police officer.

22
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:38,870
Not only did I get a job, but
my childhood dream also came true.

23
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,409
Are you really happy?

24
00:01:44,739 --> 00:01:45,909
I told you, yes.

(Flower of Evil)

00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,349
I'll give you an hour.

27
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:57,260
Come to me within an hour.

28
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:01,530
I miss you.

29
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,069

(Episode 10)

31
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,819
I'm Yeom Sang Chul.

32
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,889
You can call me Mr. Yeom.

33
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:44,270
You're more gullible than I thought.

34
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,750
It's the opposite.

35
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,250
It doesn't matter who you are
and what your intentions are.

36
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,080
I don't care why you're taking...

37
00:02:59,419 --> 00:03:00,789
our good.

38
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,189
The thing with our deal...

39
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:06,719
is that it's more important
that you trust me than I trust you.

40
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,259
What do you mean by that?

41
00:03:47,969 --> 00:03:50,439

42
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,469

(Husband)

45
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,780
Yes, honey.

46
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:03,150
Where should I go?
To the police station?

47
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,919
Meet me at the park
in front of the station.

48
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,029
Right.

49
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:28,139
Put a drop of this on your pillow
before you go to bed.

50
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,810
You'll get a good night's sleep.

51
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,579
I'll leave
after assembling this one.

52
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,879
What are you doing?

53
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,519
I'll be quick.
Just wait a little bit.

54
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,120
That's not what I'm talking about.

55
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,459
I'll really be quick.

56
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,009
Hey, this creates a nice mood,

57
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:03,509
doesn't it?

58
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,920
You ran away
when I needed you the most.

59
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,180
You acted like
you forgot everything,

60
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:47,550
but you didn't.

61

(Kim Mu Jin)

62
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,660
I don't want...

63
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,769
to apologize to you
for what happened then.

64
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,500
I never asked for an apology.

65
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,240
I'm telling you
I don't need you anymore.

66
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:48,009
There isn't a thing
you can do for me.

67
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,420
I ran away then.

68
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,189
That's why I'm confident...

69
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,829
I'll be able to understand you
better than anyone now.

70
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,100
I killed someone.

71
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,269
If that wasn't enough,

72
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,110
I made Hyun Su responsible
for what I did.

73
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:19,139
The person
Hyun Su cherishes the most...

74
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:22,850
thinks Do Hyun Su
is a brutal murderer.

75
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,750
I need to reveal the truth,

76
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,389
so don't make me get weak.

77
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:33,420
Hae Su,

78
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:35,360
that can't be the best way.

79
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,759
I said, don't make me get weak!

80
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:46,199
Hey.

81
00:07:46,939 --> 00:07:50,209
If you shut yourself in your room
and cry alone like that,

82
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,209
that's being really foolish.

83
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,680
You know that?

84
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:10,430
Why can't I do anything for you?

85
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:15,300
You might feel sick,

86
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:18,399
your toilet could get clogged,

87
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,839
you might need
to move something heavy,

88
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:24,709
and you might suddenly get scared
for no reason...

89
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:26,810
to the point it strangles you.

90
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:29,750
It doesn't matter...

91
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,550
if it's day or night to me.

92
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,090
If that ever happens, call me.

93
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:37,659
Okay?

94
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,490
It's not pity.

95
00:08:43,129 --> 00:08:45,230
I don't want us to go back
to the way we were either.

96
00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:48,870
I...

97
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:52,500
I just don't want you
to endure it alone.

98
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:56,309
That's all.

99
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:20,230
(Do Hae Su)

100
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,740
This is Cha Ji Won speaking.

101
00:09:26,669 --> 00:09:28,570
I'd like to tell you...

102
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:30,710
what I couldn't last time.

103
00:09:32,179 --> 00:09:33,279
Sorry?

104
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,049
I know...

105
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,320
who the real killer...

106
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,850
of the Gagyeong-ri Village Foreman
Murder Case is.

107
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,120
The real killer?

108
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:47,730
Hyun Su...

109
00:09:49,929 --> 00:09:51,929
Do Hyun Su is innocent.

110
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,000
He didn't kill anyone.

111
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:56,929
Someone else was the killer.

112
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:02,210
When it's time...

113
00:10:04,409 --> 00:10:06,210
When I finish what I must do,

114
00:10:08,509 --> 00:10:11,879
I'll tell you everything
about that night.

115
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,549
Please remember...

116
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:18,720
this promise I've made.

117
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:58,129
It took me exactly 58 minutes.

118
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:04,970
I was the only one...

119
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,240
you had.

120
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,879
Even now,

121
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,539
I'm the only one you have.

122
00:11:16,179 --> 00:11:17,210
Ji Won.

123
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,320
Are you hurt anywhere?

124
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:23,250
Why would I be?

125
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:30,799
- About that call...
- When I said I wanted to break up,

126
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,730
I didn't mean it.

127
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,799
When I said I got sick of you,

128
00:11:40,539 --> 00:11:42,039
that was definitely a lie.

129
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,610
Yes. I know.

130
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,509
No, you don't.

131
00:11:55,389 --> 00:11:56,419
I wish...

132
00:11:57,289 --> 00:11:59,720
you could live as me
for just one day.

133
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:05,259
That way, you'd know how much...

134
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:09,029
I love you.

135
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,570
If that happened,
I wouldn't feel this upset.

136
00:12:20,009 --> 00:12:21,149
Something's...

137
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,450
going on,

138
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:26,919
right?

139
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:46,740
Do you even know
what you're saying right now?

140
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:49,639
You're saying that
a human-trafficking broker...

141
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:51,340
is involved in a serial murder case!

142
00:12:53,309 --> 00:12:54,679
Can you take responsibility
for what you've said?

143
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,580
Do you have proof?

144
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,549
This is just a speculation, sir.

145
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:01,389
I need more time.

146
00:13:01,389 --> 00:13:02,590
Time?

147
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,490
What if Hwang Jung Soon dies?
How will you find the mastermind?

148
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,559
The surgery is over.

149
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,429
Tonight will be half the battle.

150
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:18,539
Gosh, I can't believe
this mess we're in.

151
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,509
We can only continue
our investigation...

152
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,710
once she regains consciousness.

153
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,679
Anyway, let me know
if she's doing any better.

154
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,509
Okay, bye.

(Gangsu Police Station)

156
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,889
Detective Choi Jae Seop
of Gangsu Police Station speaking.

157
00:13:43,129 --> 00:13:44,929
Who? Ms. Oh Bok Ja?

158
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:47,799
I'm Oh Bok Ja
from Homi Village, Gagyeong-ri.

159

Homi Village, Gagyeong-ri,
Namchun-myeon.

160
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:53,899
Pardon?

161
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,039
Pardon? You have a picture
of Do Hyun Su...

162
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:57,210
from five years ago?

163
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:00,809
- Don't you remember me?
- Of course, I do, ma'am.

164
00:14:00,809 --> 00:14:03,450
Hello, ma'am. What is it?

165
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:07,889
I had returned home today
after staying with my daughter.

166
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:11,360
I was cleaning the house...

167
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,759
and found a strange-looking object.

168
00:14:20,429 --> 00:14:21,500
What is this?

169
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,139
(Gangsu Police Station)

170
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:28,139
Why didn't I think
that Hwang Jung Soon...

171
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:31,210
could've climbed out of the window
while I was away?

172
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,210
I was too conceited.

173
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,250
(Gangsu Police Station)

174
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,779
I feel too ashamed
to see my teammates.

175
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,320
Is the situation that bad right now?

176
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,419
I'm too exhausted
to continue working.

177
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,029
You should be
the breadwinner instead.

178
00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:55,100
I mean...

179
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:59,039
In two years,
Eun Ha will be attending school.

180
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,940
I had been thinking about this
for a while now.

181
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,379
How about sending her
to a school in the countryside?

182
00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:06,139
That's the trend nowadays.

183
00:15:08,549 --> 00:15:10,409
Once this case is over,

184
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,789
I want to raise Eun Ha
and live quietly...

185
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:17,220
where there's fresh air.

186
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:20,259
Would you...

187
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:22,830
like that?

188
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,570
(Cha Ji Won, National Police Agency)

189
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:35,740
I can still vividly remember
the time...

190
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,779
when you were so elated
to have this around your neck.

191
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:42,450
(Cha Ji Won, National Police Agency)

192
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:43,509
That's okay.

193
00:15:44,419 --> 00:15:45,549
It's become a boring job now.

194
00:15:47,419 --> 00:15:50,889
You seem a bit off today.

195
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,559
Don't be ridiculous.

196
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:57,090
Go home, now. I should go in.

197
00:15:57,899 --> 00:15:59,200
I have loads of work.

198
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,200
Bye.

199
00:16:56,389 --> 00:16:57,419
I'm sorry,

200
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:00,019
but I have to go.

201
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:22,880
Wait for my call
at midnight tonight.

202
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,930
Talk.

203
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,700
We'll make our deal tomorrow
at midnight.

204
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:45,039
But first, bring 100,000 dollars
to my office.

205
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,019
If you pick one of them,
I can bring them to you by tomorrow.

206
00:18:07,589 --> 00:18:10,089
If you want to make an order,
it'll take some time.

207
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,500
Do none of them interest you?

208
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:18,599
That kid.

209
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:21,039
I'll take the kid.

210
00:18:50,769 --> 00:18:53,240
Do Min Seok's accomplice's name
and photo.

211
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:56,769
I want them too.

212
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,289
You're making it...

213
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,160
difficult to refuse.

214
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,829
Get our new customer a phone.

215
00:19:28,369 --> 00:19:29,509
It's a burner phone.

216
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,039
We'll only keep in touch using this.

217
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,150
I'll explain the rules
of our deal, so listen carefully.

218
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:39,349
If you disobey the rules,
our deal is off immediately.

219
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,220
If our deal is called off,
I will not hesitate for a second...

220
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:44,819
to get rid of all the evidence.

221
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,559
And what I mean by evidence,

222
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,859
it includes people as well.

223
00:20:12,619 --> 00:20:14,549
So...

224
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:20,519
The person who I hit...

225
00:20:21,589 --> 00:20:23,859
with my car...

226
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,130
is living...

227
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,430
as me right now?

228
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:37,109
We determined that it was
hard for you to survive.

229
00:20:39,309 --> 00:20:41,579
Then... Then...

230
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,849
What about me?

231
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,990
How do I live...

232
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:51,359
from now on?

233
00:20:56,059 --> 00:20:57,730
What will happen...

234
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:02,269
to my life?

235
00:21:04,869 --> 00:21:07,140
Just tell me that.

236
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:11,480
I'll live the way...

237
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:15,309
you and Mom want me...

238
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,319
to live.

239
00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:27,220
Dad.

240
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:32,400
Can't you...

241
00:21:33,029 --> 00:21:34,799
ask him?

242
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:39,099
To give me back my name?

243
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,740
I will...

244
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,279
I will meet him and ask him.

245
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:52,349
Let me meet him.

246
00:21:58,059 --> 00:22:01,660
(Hee Seong)

247
00:22:09,069 --> 00:22:10,970
Why are you calling so late?

248
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,400
I have a favor to ask you.

249
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,769
A favor?

250
00:22:16,009 --> 00:22:19,240
I need money.
100,000 dollars in cash.

251
00:22:19,779 --> 00:22:20,940
What do you need it for?

252
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:26,250
I think I can find the accomplice
of the Yeonju Serial Murder Case.

253
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,289
How?

254
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:38,359
I found someone who knows about
the accomplice.

255
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,900
They want money in trade
for the information.

256
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,230
You don't want...

257
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:47,440
Do Hyun Su's name being mentioned
anymore either.

258
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:50,970
I'll see you tomorrow.

259
00:22:51,809 --> 00:22:53,039
Come to the hospital.

260
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,980
What is it? What did Hee Seong...

261
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:04,390
What did Hyun Su say?

262
00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:08,059
It's nothing.

263
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:17,299
Dad.

264
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,539
Let me meet him.

265
00:23:25,309 --> 00:23:26,539
Never.

266
00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:28,480
Why not?

267
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:33,680
If he sees me in person,

268
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:37,589
he might feel pity.

269
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,390
He's not someone
you can underestimate.

270
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,660
If he finds out you're awake,

271
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:51,000
your presence will bother him.

272
00:23:59,609 --> 00:24:00,910
Then...

273
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:04,309
what will you do?

274
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:07,619
What can I do?

275
00:24:09,789 --> 00:24:11,019
I'll just...

276
00:24:12,089 --> 00:24:15,460
have to hope we get lucky.

277
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:23,190
Let's learn about happy expressions.

278
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:26,000
Number one, wrinkles develop
around your eyes.

279
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:29,569
Number two, your cheeks go up.

280
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,940
Number three, you can feel
the wrinkles around your eyes...

281
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,369
move slightly.

282
00:26:23,819 --> 00:26:25,890
Are you leaving already?
You didn't get enough sleep.

283
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:29,559
Something urgent came up.
Hwang Jung Soon died.

284
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:31,289
What? Ji Won.

285
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,500
Wait.

286
00:26:38,869 --> 00:26:39,940
Why aren't you asking me?

287
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:42,670
Ask you what?

288
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,140
What I did last night with whom.

289
00:26:45,579 --> 00:26:47,480
And why I answered
the phone like that.

290
00:26:49,309 --> 00:26:51,549
Tell me when you really want to.

291
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:55,049
I'm ready to listen anytime.

292
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:04,089
See you later.

293
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:07,559
Everything will go well.
Don't worry too much.

294
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,730
I'm Chief Yoon Sang Pil
of the violent crimes unit.

295
00:27:41,029 --> 00:27:42,269
I'll head today's briefing...

296
00:27:42,269 --> 00:27:44,700
for the reinvestigation of the
Yeonju Serial Murder Case.

297
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,470
We've already provided you
with the press release.

298
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:50,140
We'll receive any questions
you may have now.

299
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,240
Yes?

300
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:55,180
I'm Park Jin Gyu of K-news.

301
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,210
It's difficult to determine how
Hwang Jung Soon is related...

302
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:00,920
to the serial murder case
based on this press release only.

303
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,549
Also, we want to hear your position
on whether your sting operation...

304
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,390
was legitimate when it led to
someone's death.

305
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:18,329
Did you check Hwang Jung Soon's
bank account?

306
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,869
There's nothing special.
What stands out...

307
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:25,109
is that she wired money once a month
regularly to a sanatorium.

308
00:28:25,509 --> 00:28:27,309
Her mother has Alzheimer's.

309
00:28:30,109 --> 00:28:31,819
Did you find out
where she went yesterday?

310
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:37,150
She went to a market in Jaerim-dong,
and that's as far as I know.

311
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:39,059
Jaerim-dong?

312
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,660
Yes. Why?

313
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:42,960
It's nothing.

314
00:28:45,329 --> 00:28:47,200
There's no one coming
to collect her body,

315
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,670
let alone hold a funeral.

316
00:28:55,369 --> 00:28:57,670
By the way, didn't you go
to Gagyeong-ri yesterday?

317
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,240
That? It was nothing much.

318
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,109
Why did you go there?

319
00:29:04,349 --> 00:29:05,750
Well, just...

320
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:17,730
Yes?

321
00:29:17,829 --> 00:29:20,430
I'm Detective Cha Ji Won
from Gangsu Police Station.

322
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:25,299
Hello?

323
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,269
Please go ahead.

324
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:32,710
I have something important to report
about the Yeonju Serial Murder Case.

325
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,450
May I ask who's calling?

326
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:40,750
I'm Do Hyun Su.

327
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,829
May I ask who's calling?

328
00:29:52,029 --> 00:29:53,130
I'm Do Hyun Su.

329
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:00,869
Who?

330
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:13,420
I'm Do Hyun Su.

331
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,890
What is it, Ji Won?

332
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,559
Hello?

333
00:30:32,369 --> 00:30:33,500
Please go ahead.

334
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,339
Who?

335
00:30:38,609 --> 00:30:41,210
"Do Hyun Su"? The Do Hyun Su?

336
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,450
Do Min Seok's son Do Hyun Su?

337
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:49,319
How many times are you making me
introduce myself?

338
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:53,619
You punk. You'll get in trouble
if you prank call the police.

339
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:57,630
I'm going to help you
catch the accomplice,

340
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,160
but you're being too rude.

341
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,059
Now I want to hang up.

342
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:04,470
Wait. Please hold on.

343
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:07,539
He says he's Do Hyun Su.

344
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,210
He identified himself as Do Hyun Su.

345
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:20,319
Rule one. Do not carry any wireless
devices right after the deal.

346
00:31:20,549 --> 00:31:21,650
Rule two.

347
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:24,019
I'll check the money first.

348
00:31:24,089 --> 00:31:26,460
Rule three.
Once I've checked the money,

349
00:31:26,859 --> 00:31:29,289
you're to move to
a designated place to get your good.

350
00:31:29,289 --> 00:31:30,430
Simple, right?

351
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,529
The picture of the man you want...

352
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:36,400
will be handed to you on the spot
after I check my money.

353
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,440
Mr. Do Hyun Su.

354
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,509
We'll put you on speakerphone
from now on. Is that okay?

355
00:31:54,019 --> 00:31:55,049
Okay.

356
00:31:57,019 --> 00:32:00,390
How many detectives
am I speaking to right now?

357
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:02,460
Four.

358
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:06,759
No one else should know about
this phone call.

359
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:09,569
Can you promise me?

360
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,640
I promise.

361
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:27,450
I'd like to inform you
that I'm also recording this call.

362
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:30,890
What information do you have?

363
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:38,089
There's a human trafficking
organization that abducted...

364
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:39,559
and sold people to Do Min Seok
and his accomplice.

365
00:32:41,029 --> 00:32:43,069
I know about the organization.

366
00:32:52,109 --> 00:32:54,710
Do Min Seok and the accomplice
were supplied...

367
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:57,049
with the victims
through that organization.

368
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:03,950
Tonight, I'll be making
a deal with that organization.

369
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:08,789
I'll be getting a victim
who was confined,

370
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:12,130
as well as some information
about the accomplice.

371
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:18,740
I can create the golden opportunity
for you to raid the scene.

372
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,509
What time is it happening? Where?

373
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:27,039
Now...

374
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,079
I'll tell you my conditions.

375
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,549
As you might have guessed,

376
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,119
this phone was registered
under someone else.

377
00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:37,089
Also,

378
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:42,390
even if you track my location now,

379
00:33:44,529 --> 00:33:46,430
it won't be easy to find me.

380
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:50,670
I'll share all the information
I know...

381
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,670
so you can close
the Yeonju Serial Murder Case.

382
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:59,880
I want you to swear on your honor
and promise...

383
00:34:00,109 --> 00:34:02,210
to keep my identity a secret.

384
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,349
Also, all the information
you collect from this call...

385
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:09,389
must be discarded
when the investigation closes.

386
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:14,289
Anything else?

387
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:18,190
- That's all.
- Wait.

388
00:34:18,829 --> 00:34:20,000
That's all?

389
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:23,030
You've been on the run
for almost 20 years.

390
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:26,039
Did you call the police
just for the sake of justice?

391
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:27,769
Do you expect us to believe that?

392
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:33,239
I'm not Do Min Seok's accomplice.

393
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,510
I want to prove that.

394
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:41,519
I guess he really isn't
the accomplice.

395
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,349
How can we trust that?

396
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:48,789
I'm not even sure
if you're really Do Hyun Su...

397
00:34:48,889 --> 00:34:51,389
or if you're a lunatic.

398
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,630
Mr. Do Hyun Su.

399
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,199
Yes?

400
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:00,199
Let's do it this way.

401
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:06,340
Tell us about the person
who sold people to Do Min Seok.

402
00:35:07,409 --> 00:35:09,480
After we verify the information,

403
00:35:10,409 --> 00:35:13,280
we'll determine if your report
is reliable or not.

404
00:35:14,019 --> 00:35:15,849
Then, we'll ask
for the next information.

405
00:35:16,789 --> 00:35:20,719
If we end up getting
additional information from you,

406
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:22,059
we'll meet your demands.

407
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,099
All right.

408
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,539
I'll give you some information
about Yeom Sang Chul.

409
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:37,840
"Yeom Sang Chul"?

410
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:40,409
Please act with caution.

411
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,010
If he catches on,

412
00:35:45,349 --> 00:35:47,380
all the confined victims will die.

413
00:35:48,449 --> 00:35:49,449
And...

414
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,260
I'll be gone as well.

415
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:19,719
Yes, Ji Won.

416
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:24,690
What are you doing?

417
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,320
I'm out to get supplies. What is it?

418
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:29,230
Honey.

419
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,889
Can you pick me up later?

420
00:36:32,699 --> 00:36:34,199
Let's have dinner together.

421
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:39,199
Let's go to that spicy noodle place
we went to last time.

422
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:40,539
I'm craving it.

423
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:48,309
Right.
I don't think I can go home tonight.

424
00:36:51,179 --> 00:36:52,349
Why not?

425
00:36:52,349 --> 00:36:53,880
I have to go to a funeral.

426
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,489
The father of a client passed away.

427
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:58,090
Don't go.

428
00:37:01,389 --> 00:37:02,530
Why not?

429
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:05,230
Don't go. I don't want you to go.

430
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,670
Ji Won.

431
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:17,769
Actually,

432
00:37:20,909 --> 00:37:23,179
I had a really bad dream last night.

433
00:37:27,619 --> 00:37:31,219
See? It's because you didn't get
any proper sleep.

434
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:35,090
Are you going to go?

435
00:37:35,889 --> 00:37:38,030
Yes. I have to.

436
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,000
Do whatever you want.

437
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,630
- I'm hanging up.
- Ji Won.

438
00:37:46,099 --> 00:37:47,199
I...

439
00:37:48,469 --> 00:37:50,110
want to become someone
that's good enough...

440
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,610
for you.

441
00:37:54,909 --> 00:37:56,349
Someone good enough.

442
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,820
I have to go back to work.

443
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,429
I'll call you...

444
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,500
around 10pm later.

445
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:18,099
Okay. Sure.

446
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:57,739
Aren't you cold?

447
00:38:58,739 --> 00:39:00,440
It's okay.

448
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:03,710
I can be outside.

449
00:39:25,469 --> 00:39:27,699
Would you like a cup of warm tea?

450
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:30,510
Thank you.

451
00:39:38,349 --> 00:39:39,619
How much...

452
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:42,380
does she know?

453
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:51,289
We purposely hired someone
who couldn't read lips.

454
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:53,960
She also signed
a confidential agreement.

455
00:39:55,969 --> 00:39:59,170
Even if she knew something,
she wouldn't tell it to anyone.

456
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:06,539
Hee Seong.

457
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,050
Who was the person...

458
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:14,920
you said you had...

459
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:16,849
to meet?

460
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:23,630
A woman.

461
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:25,690
A woman?

462
00:40:27,059 --> 00:40:29,699
Had there not been an accident
that day,

463
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:33,969
we would've met.

464
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:37,469
And if we had met,

465
00:40:40,309 --> 00:40:42,239
our fates...

466
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:47,349
would've changed completely.

467
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:57,829
(The Three Mysteries about
Jung Mi Sook's Disappearance)

468
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:04,670
"The Three Mysteries about
Jung Mi Sook's Disappearance."

469
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:11,139
Everyone knows this information.
It's just the title that's enticing.

470
00:41:11,409 --> 00:41:14,139
That's exactly the point.
It's enticing.

471
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:22,619
- What?
- You're quite the wily type.

472
00:41:23,289 --> 00:41:24,750
Don't beat around the bush
and just give it to me.

473
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:27,559
- Give what?
- Do Hae Su's exclusive interview.

474
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,690
There's no such thing.

475
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:32,360
She came here saying
she'd only talk with you.

476
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,400
If you didn't interview her,
then what did you do?

477
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:36,699
Confess my feelings?

478
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:39,739
Are you saying
you two are going out?

479
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:41,969
No.

480
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,539
Did she reject you?

481
00:41:43,809 --> 00:41:44,840
Yes.

482
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:46,280
That's great.

483
00:41:46,539 --> 00:41:48,380
Just interview her.
What's stopping you?

484
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:51,449
How can you be so inhumane?

485
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:57,619
Let's meet. It's important.

486
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,619
I'm going to do some legwork.

487
00:42:00,659 --> 00:42:02,059
Mu Jin.

488
00:42:04,489 --> 00:42:06,130
I fell in love
while interviewing someone...

489
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:07,400
and even got married to him.

490
00:42:08,199 --> 00:42:09,369
But you divorced him.

491
00:42:10,329 --> 00:42:13,139
You said you were too rash
and told me to be careful.

492
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:15,369
That's a different issue.

493
00:42:15,369 --> 00:42:17,610
- Get lost right now!
- Yes, ma'am.

494
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,579
Ms. Do, you're the wind.

495
00:42:23,949 --> 00:42:25,809
You can go wherever you want.

496
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,880
When I count to three,

497
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:32,690
you'll arrive
at your father's funeral.

498
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,059
One,

499
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:37,329
two,

500
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:39,300
three.

501
00:42:49,369 --> 00:42:50,409
Ms. Do?

502
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,980
You have more than enough time.

503
00:42:53,809 --> 00:42:56,610
Take your time
to observe the culprit.

504
00:43:05,619 --> 00:43:06,789
Something's strange.

505
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:10,559
His left fingernails...

506
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:14,000
are too short.

507
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:18,469
It must be uncomfortable for him.

508
00:43:18,969 --> 00:43:20,170
You're doing well.

509
00:43:24,369 --> 00:43:26,239
What? I think I've seen...

510
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,710
that design before.

511
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:31,980
Where did I see it?

512
00:43:34,519 --> 00:43:36,789
How does the culprit look?

513
00:43:44,929 --> 00:43:46,030
He is...

514
00:43:46,829 --> 00:43:49,469
looking at me slowly.

515
00:43:51,329 --> 00:43:52,500
He's studying...

516
00:43:53,639 --> 00:43:55,570
every inch of my face.

517
00:43:58,739 --> 00:44:00,610
He's trying to remember my face.

518
00:44:03,309 --> 00:44:04,349
I'm scared.

519
00:44:05,349 --> 00:44:06,679
Get me out of here.

520
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:09,420
Ms. Do, open your eyes
on the count of three.

521
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:11,250
1, 2, 3.

522
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:17,760
He was trying to remember my face.

523
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:21,000
Don't you know what that means?

524
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:26,300
He's going...

525
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:28,639
to kill me.

526
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,010
Ms. Do, calm down.

527
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:34,340
What you just experienced...

528
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:35,909
happened 18 years ago.

529
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:38,880
You're fine. Nothing will happen.

530
00:44:39,949 --> 00:44:41,250
Trust me.

531
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:45,389
I don't think you should drive
back home.

532
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:48,360
Do you have anyone to call?

533
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,360
I'm fine.

534
00:44:50,429 --> 00:44:51,530
I need a break.

535
00:44:56,929 --> 00:45:00,500
(Mu Jin)

536
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:01,699
(Yeom Sang Chul's
Organizational Chart)

537
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:03,840
Yeom Sang Chul, born in 1973.

538
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:05,739
In 1990 at the age of 17,

539
00:45:05,739 --> 00:45:07,340
he was sentenced
to ten years of prison...

540
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:08,710
for attempted murder and arson.

541
00:45:08,909 --> 00:45:10,380
However, he was released on parole
in 1997...

542
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:12,050
on the condition of doing
community service.

543
00:45:12,179 --> 00:45:15,219
What's important is that
after he was released,

544
00:45:15,219 --> 00:45:16,650
he did community service...

545
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:20,659
at Deep Spring
Child Guidance Clinic.

546
00:45:21,789 --> 00:45:23,530
Is that...

547
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:27,130
That's where Do Hyun Su
was treated from 1997 to 1999.

548
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,769
That means Yeom Sang Chul
and Do Min Seok could've met.

549
00:45:31,469 --> 00:45:32,530
Exactly.

550
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,139
What about him and Hwang Jung Soon?

551
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:38,909
Yeom is running an employment agency
in Jaerim-dong.

552
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:40,380
Ho Joon.

553
00:45:41,909 --> 00:45:43,280
This was yesterday.

554
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:46,619
The CCTV camera in the parking lot
across his employment agency...

555
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:47,880
caught her.

556
00:45:49,019 --> 00:45:52,789
This means Do Hyun Su's tip-off
is credible.

557
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:55,590
Yes, I'm sure of it.

558
00:45:56,789 --> 00:45:58,230
How could
a human-trafficking gang...

559
00:45:58,230 --> 00:46:00,730
get involved
in a serial murder case?

560
00:46:01,329 --> 00:46:03,530
This is unbelievable.

561
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:06,469
If we catch all of them,

562
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,739
every single one of us
will receive a special promotion.

563
00:46:10,639 --> 00:46:12,710
Don't get ahead of yourself.

564
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:16,349
We're catching Do Hyun Su too,
right?

565
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:26,659
Are you okay?

566
00:46:27,989 --> 00:46:29,860
Let me come with you from now on.

567
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,260
You're not supposed to drive
after receiving hypnotherapy.

568
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,130
I'm going to find another therapist.

569
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:38,630
I can't trust someone who answered
my phone without my consent.

570
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:41,769
She only picked up...

571
00:46:42,139 --> 00:46:44,840
because the name you saved me as
sounded very friendly.

572
00:46:48,110 --> 00:46:49,809
(Mu Jin)

573
00:46:50,909 --> 00:46:52,510
(Reporter Kim)

574
00:46:57,519 --> 00:46:58,849
Open up your heart, will you?

575
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:01,019
Why should I open my heart to you?

576
00:47:02,059 --> 00:47:03,889
Not to me but your therapist.

577
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:10,570
She said your suspicions
and anxiety toward others...

578
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:11,869
are deeply rooted.

579
00:47:12,570 --> 00:47:16,039
Because of that, she said
you may be creating your own fears.

580
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:22,409
Why did Hyun Su contact you?

581
00:47:23,949 --> 00:47:25,050
I'm not sure.

582
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:27,980
Yesterday, he said
he remembered something and left.

583
00:47:28,219 --> 00:47:29,750
Perhaps, it's about that.

584
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:34,460
You're going to deceive Do Hyun Su?

585
00:47:35,059 --> 00:47:37,690
Didn't we promise to keep him safe
in exchange for the information?

586
00:47:37,829 --> 00:47:40,929
What kind of detective
protects murderers?

587
00:47:41,059 --> 00:47:43,670
There's no such law. Aren't I right?

588
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:46,800
You're right about that.

589
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:49,239
The more we talk on the phone,

590
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,309
the higher the chance we get
in locating him.

591
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:53,440
If we get him on the phone often,

592
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:57,079
we'll be able to get
a rough location of his residence.

593
00:47:57,210 --> 00:47:59,849
We'll ask men in that area
in their 30s and 40s...

594
00:47:59,849 --> 00:48:02,550
and collect their DNA.

595
00:48:03,019 --> 00:48:06,420
Then we'll compare them
to Do Hae Su's DNA.

596
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:09,320
- Since they're siblings...
- Exactly!

597
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:12,159
We can identify him!

598
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:15,530
Why are you so quiet?

599
00:48:15,929 --> 00:48:17,099
I'm sure you're up for this.

600
00:48:19,369 --> 00:48:21,869
You called the police
and gave them a tip?

601
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:23,239
Yes.

602
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:27,980
And you told them
you were Do Hyun Su?

603
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:34,219
That's how they'll move quickly.

604
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,420
We don't have time.

605
00:48:36,889 --> 00:48:39,789
Have you lost your mind?

606
00:48:40,289 --> 00:48:42,119
If my tip turns out to be true,

607
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,590
they promised to protect me.

608
00:48:44,829 --> 00:48:45,989
How can you trust that?

609
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:48,730
How can you trust the police?

610
00:48:49,329 --> 00:48:52,170
They'll just suck you dry
and backstab you.

611
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:54,170
Are you stupid?

612
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:56,000
All you need to do is...

613
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,269
make Yeom Sang Chul
tell you about the accomplice.

614
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:01,340
Once the police get involved,

615
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:03,380
he'll find out you betrayed him.

616
00:49:03,809 --> 00:49:04,980
Do you think he'll let you live?

617
00:49:14,659 --> 00:49:16,019
You know, those people
who are confined.

618
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:20,829
I thought about what Ji Won
would've done...

619
00:49:22,199 --> 00:49:23,329
if she were me.

620
00:49:25,269 --> 00:49:26,539
If it was Ji Won,

621
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:30,510
she would never have left
those people like that.

622
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:37,409
Mu Jin, I need your help.

623
00:49:40,179 --> 00:49:43,519
Things might not turn out
as planned.

624
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:46,960
We need to consider
something unexpected happening too.

625
00:49:47,389 --> 00:49:49,829
What about me? I want to help too.

626
00:49:50,059 --> 00:49:51,260
What can I do?

627
00:49:53,099 --> 00:49:54,159
Nothing.

628
00:49:54,829 --> 00:49:56,130
I want to do something too.

629
00:49:56,429 --> 00:49:58,900
I don't trust you enough
to entrust you...

630
00:49:59,269 --> 00:50:00,500
with something important.

631
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:02,199
What?

632
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:04,409
You're unstable.

633
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:08,110
You almost made a mistake
in front of Ji Won last time.

634
00:50:09,949 --> 00:50:13,480
You might get too emotional
and ruin everything.

635
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:16,550
Hey, how could you be so rude?

636
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:18,349
It's okay, Mu Jin.

637
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:20,289
I know how much
you think of Hyun Su.

638
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:22,519
This punk doesn't even know that.

639
00:50:23,630 --> 00:50:25,130
What Hyun Su said isn't wrong.

640
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:39,980
It's Ji Won's number.

641
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:42,110
Don't answer it.

642
00:50:58,730 --> 00:50:59,900
Yes?

643
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:04,070
This is Detective Cha Ji Won
of Gangsu Police Station.

644
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:06,840
I'll put you on speakerphone now.

645
00:51:07,869 --> 00:51:09,400
I'm Captain Lee Woo Chul.

646
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:13,239
We will believe the tip you gave us.

647
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:19,610
Let me explain one more time.
There are two steps to the deal.

648
00:51:21,079 --> 00:51:22,679
At the first rendezvous point,

649
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:24,449
I will hand over the money
to Yeom Sang Chul.

650
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:27,159
After he checks the money,

651
00:51:27,659 --> 00:51:29,960
he will give me the information
on the second rendezvous point.

652
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:34,559
I will go to the second
rendezvous point,

653
00:51:35,159 --> 00:51:37,130
and the victims will be handed over
to me.

654
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:40,469
If there's a problem
during the first meeting,

655
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:43,909
the second meeting itself
will be canceled, and your chance...

656
00:51:45,239 --> 00:51:48,039
to raid a human trafficking scene
will go down the drain.

657
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:52,949
So after you meet Mr. Yeom
at first...

658
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:55,650
and inform us of the
second rendezvous point,

659
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:59,250
we'll raid the scene when
the victims are handed over, right?

660
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:01,389
I will be responsible
for the first meeting...

661
00:52:01,719 --> 00:52:05,059
and the police must make no mistake
at the second meeting.

662
00:52:05,329 --> 00:52:09,130
That's how you'll be able to catch
Yeom Sang Chul's whole gang.

663
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:10,630
Mr. Do.

664
00:52:11,869 --> 00:52:15,400
No matter how much I think about it,
doing this on your own is too risky.

665
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,309
You need police protection.

666
00:52:19,139 --> 00:52:21,610
Where is the first rendezvous point?

667
00:52:22,179 --> 00:52:24,909
No. I won't get involved
with the police...

668
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:27,019
no matter what happens.

669
00:52:27,719 --> 00:52:30,550
Mr. Do. I said...

670
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:33,119
we're going to protect you.

671
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:35,760
Trust us, we won't arrest you.

672
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:42,059
Mr. Do.

673
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:45,469
Trust us.

674
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:54,179
What's important is to keep
Do Hyun Su on the phone...

675
00:52:54,179 --> 00:52:56,679
in order for us to find out
his location.

676
00:52:58,179 --> 00:53:01,179
Ji Won is perfect for that job.

677
00:53:03,989 --> 00:53:05,320
I can't do that.

678
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:11,730
Do Hyun Su gave us a tip
to save abducted victims...

679
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:14,260
despite putting himself at risk.

680
00:53:15,929 --> 00:53:19,630
But if we have to backstab
an informant like that...

681
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:21,969
If that's our job,

682
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,340
I'll leave this investigation team.

683
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:32,480
We're not some lowly thugs
who backstab informants...

684
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,449
who provide important tips.

685
00:53:34,679 --> 00:53:36,480
You can trust us.

686
00:53:38,849 --> 00:53:41,690
Your safety is not guaranteed
in this operation.

687
00:53:41,690 --> 00:53:43,559
That's what we're concerned about.

688
00:53:45,059 --> 00:53:46,559
We'll do our best...

689
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:49,800
to protect your identity.

690
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,400
So please put your safety first.

691
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,840
I won't get involved with
the police in any way whatsoever.

692
00:53:58,969 --> 00:54:02,210
You can save the abducted people.

693
00:54:03,309 --> 00:54:05,280
I'll take care of
my part of the deal.

694
00:54:24,969 --> 00:54:26,300
How are the goods?

695
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:28,769
One of them has an eye problem.

696
00:54:29,269 --> 00:54:30,739
It's diabetes.

697
00:54:32,210 --> 00:54:33,309
What about the kid?

698
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,780
He's a bit dehydrated,
but he'll be okay.

699
00:54:37,409 --> 00:54:39,679
- Just make sure the kid is okay.
- Yes, sir.

700
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,019
Are you sure
Hwang Jung Soon is dead?

701
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:43,389
Yes, I checked.

702
00:54:44,619 --> 00:54:45,989
It turned out for the better.

703
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:47,960
We don't have to deal with her now.

704
00:54:51,389 --> 00:54:53,659
She fell into the trap
set by the police.

705
00:54:54,599 --> 00:54:56,500
Man, she was so stupid.

706
00:54:57,869 --> 00:55:01,369
She was getting a bit cocky,
and was starting to annoy me.

707
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:05,369
Why are you laughing?

708
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,280
She was still one of ours.

709
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:10,780
I'm sorry, sir.

710
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:13,250
We better lay low for a while
after this deal.

711
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:17,289
Load the rest of the goods
on the boat now.

712
00:55:17,889 --> 00:55:18,889
Yes, sir.

713
00:55:22,159 --> 00:55:23,260
I'm back, sir.

714
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:37,670
It's nice to see him again
after so long.

715
00:55:39,070 --> 00:55:41,210
He used to hang out
with Do Min Seok so much.

716
00:55:41,909 --> 00:55:43,610
But he literally vanished lately.

717
00:55:56,090 --> 00:55:57,230
I'm a man who believes...

718
00:55:58,630 --> 00:56:02,599
that money can solve
the easiest problems in life.

719
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:04,369
But...

720
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:07,800
I'm worried this won't solve
anything...

721
00:56:07,969 --> 00:56:10,440
but only make matters worse.

722
00:56:11,909 --> 00:56:13,070
I'll solve it.

723
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:16,039
Hyun Su.

724
00:56:18,809 --> 00:56:20,820
I'll give you ten times this amount.

725
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:26,420
Just leave without anyone
knowing about it.

726
00:56:28,219 --> 00:56:30,019
Don't worry about your family.

727
00:56:31,489 --> 00:56:33,659
I'll take care of the rest.

728
00:56:40,639 --> 00:56:41,800
No.

729
00:56:43,139 --> 00:56:44,269
Why?

730
00:56:45,269 --> 00:56:49,440
I don't want to entrust you
with my family.

731
00:56:51,050 --> 00:56:53,519
What do you think of me?

732
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,719
You're a similar human being
like me.

733
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:00,789
What?

734
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,260
A human being...

735
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:06,530
who does whatever it takes
in order to get what he wants.

736
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:13,969
What about you?

737
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:18,170
Will you be able to leave
your family in my trust?

738
00:57:20,110 --> 00:57:21,179
Good.

739
00:57:23,010 --> 00:57:24,809
I feel more relaxed...

740
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:27,480
hearing your honest remarks.

741
00:57:30,449 --> 00:57:33,960
Thank goodness people like us...

742
00:57:34,889 --> 00:57:36,320
have the same goal.

743
00:57:41,929 --> 00:57:43,670
I'll get going.

744
00:57:44,469 --> 00:57:45,469
Okay.

745
00:57:50,369 --> 00:57:51,409
Hyun Su.

746
00:57:59,150 --> 00:58:00,179
Take care.

747
00:58:19,070 --> 00:58:20,900
I said, who reported it?

748
00:58:20,969 --> 00:58:22,000
I can't tell you.

749
00:58:24,610 --> 00:58:26,340
You won't tell me the identity
of the informant,

750
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,039
yet you want backup?

751
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:29,510
Yes.

752
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:31,250
Please give us as many men
you can afford.

753
00:58:32,949 --> 00:58:36,550
In order to solve the Yeonju
Serial Murder Case flawlessly,

754
00:58:37,619 --> 00:58:39,019
we must catch Yeom Sang Chul.

755
00:58:40,619 --> 00:58:42,590
Woo Chul.
Look straight into my eyes.

756
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,059
You're sure of this, right?

757
00:59:04,949 --> 00:59:05,949
Ji Won.

758
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,980
I'll only say this once,
so listen to me carefully.

759
00:59:11,489 --> 00:59:13,989
I think we're lucky to have you
on our team.

760
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:17,789
I felt it again today.

761
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:23,969
What's this?

762
00:59:25,929 --> 00:59:27,670
Are you a little moved?

763
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:30,809
You're so slow.

764
00:59:31,039 --> 00:59:34,480
It's not that. She's feeling sick...

765
00:59:35,079 --> 00:59:36,139
from your corny lines.

766
00:59:36,679 --> 00:59:38,710
It's okay, you can throw up.

767
00:59:39,050 --> 00:59:41,349
You, come here. Come over here.

768
00:59:42,349 --> 00:59:44,019
I'll talk to you after this call.

769
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:47,960
Yes.

770
00:59:48,059 --> 00:59:51,559
I finished restoring
the formatted recorder.

771
01:00:19,849 --> 01:00:20,860
(Accept, Decline)

772
01:00:35,070 --> 01:00:37,309
- Yes?
- I'm curious about something.

773
01:00:38,639 --> 01:00:41,909
I received your bag
from Nam Soon Gil's wife.

774
01:00:44,949 --> 01:00:47,420
I listened to the recorder
from the bag.

775
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:52,219
Can you tell me...

776
01:00:54,190 --> 01:00:55,559
whose voice it was?

777
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:03,800
- If you don't want to tell me...
- It's my mom.

778
01:01:06,369 --> 01:01:07,440
What?

779
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:09,969
1997.

780
01:01:11,909 --> 01:01:14,010
It was just before Mom went missing.

781
01:01:16,579 --> 01:01:20,210
I was given that recorder
to cherish Mom's voice.

782
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:24,650
Father reported Mom missing,

783
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:28,489
and the police took away her stuff.

784
01:01:29,559 --> 01:01:30,690
I thought...

785
01:01:31,989 --> 01:01:34,159
they'd take everything from me
if I said anything.

786
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:39,070
You must have...

787
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:42,969
really loved your mother.

788
01:01:44,809 --> 01:01:46,269
A psychiatrist...

789
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:50,210
told me I lack emotional empathy.

790
01:01:52,349 --> 01:01:54,880
It's impossible for me
to have such feelings.

791
01:01:57,820 --> 01:02:00,519
Then why did you cherish it
for such a long time?

792
01:02:03,789 --> 01:02:05,130
I'm not sure about that.

793
01:02:07,099 --> 01:02:09,800
I was never diagnosed about
the motive for such behavior.

794
01:02:11,329 --> 01:02:13,130
I won't be able
to explain that for you.

795
01:02:17,170 --> 01:02:18,269
It's because...

796
01:02:25,849 --> 01:02:27,679
I don't want to lie to you.

797
01:02:31,349 --> 01:02:32,389
Mr. Do Hyun Su.

798
01:02:35,789 --> 01:02:36,860
Yes?

799
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:41,500
Please...

800
01:02:46,469 --> 01:02:47,699
don't get hurt.

801
01:02:51,739 --> 01:02:52,739
What?

802
01:02:53,670 --> 01:02:55,139
I'm hanging up.

803
01:03:10,090 --> 01:03:11,389
I'll call you...

804
01:03:12,460 --> 01:03:14,260
around 10pm later.

805
01:03:43,590 --> 01:03:44,960
In my opinion,

806
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:47,530
the sound recorded
on the cassette tape...

807
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:50,530
incites Hyun Su's aggression
and violent behavior,

808
01:03:50,769 --> 01:03:52,099
and even triggers it.

809
01:03:59,139 --> 01:04:00,239
Detective Cha?

810
01:04:01,210 --> 01:04:02,610
Why didn't you know?

811
01:04:03,110 --> 01:04:04,110
What?

812
01:04:04,210 --> 01:04:07,619
Why didn't you think that recording
could be something...

813
01:04:07,619 --> 01:04:08,920
his mother left behind?

814
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:11,719
What are you talking about,
Detective Cha?

815
01:04:12,019 --> 01:04:14,760
At the time you consulted him,
his mother just went missing.

816
01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:18,760
It's obvious what a young child
would get obsessed over.

817
01:04:18,989 --> 01:04:20,900
It's natural for any ordinary kid.

818
01:04:21,199 --> 01:04:23,659
- Detective Cha.
- You should've known.

819
01:04:24,630 --> 01:04:27,369
You were the only person
who could've helped him then.

820
01:04:27,869 --> 01:04:29,969
- What?
- You should've known!

821
01:04:41,449 --> 01:04:43,820
Why is everyone coming to me?

822
01:04:44,090 --> 01:04:46,349
The police have the forensics team
to do work like this.

823
01:04:46,389 --> 01:04:49,159
I hate leaving records.

824
01:04:49,889 --> 01:04:52,030
By the way, what do you mean
by "everyone"? Who else came?

825
01:04:52,130 --> 01:04:54,199
That detective you brought
with you last time.

826
01:04:54,530 --> 01:04:55,559
The female detective.

827
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:58,130
Cha Ji Won? Why did she come?

828
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:01,269
Come on. I can't stay
in this business if I tell you.

829
01:05:01,539 --> 01:05:02,840
You're a professional.

830
01:05:02,969 --> 01:05:04,639
This is why I like you.

831
01:05:04,869 --> 01:05:06,170
Anyway, thank you.

832
01:05:07,710 --> 01:05:10,480
He tends to have a firm attitude.
My husband...

833
01:05:11,079 --> 01:05:14,050
doesn't like it
when his plan is altered.

834
01:05:14,119 --> 01:05:16,780
He has a fixation for his plans.

835
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:20,420
Are you already thinking of
a headline, Mr. Kim?

836
01:05:24,889 --> 01:05:27,090
- Hurry up.
- Hey.

837
01:05:28,059 --> 01:05:29,829
Do you think we'll get there first?

838
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:31,570
I'm certain.

839
01:05:31,829 --> 01:05:32,900
How so?

840
01:05:34,739 --> 01:05:38,369
Firstly, I want to thank Team 2
for coming to support us.

841
01:05:40,539 --> 01:05:42,210
I'll brief the operation.

842
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:46,150
As you know, there will be
a human trafficking deal tonight.

843
01:05:46,250 --> 01:05:49,480
I'll first explain
the human trafficking organization.

844
01:05:49,579 --> 01:05:52,849
Hyun Su. How did you become...

845
01:05:52,849 --> 01:05:54,159
Baek Hee Seong?

846
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:03,599
Forget about everyone else.
How did you dupe Detective Cha?

847
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:07,340
- Mu Jin.
- Yes? Go on.

848
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:09,769
I won't judge.

849
01:06:10,369 --> 01:06:12,639
Ji Won doesn't know anything
about me.

850
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:16,710
She doesn't know about my past
or that I'm not normal.

851
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:21,619
Hyun Su.

852
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:25,489
How did you become Baek Hee Seong?

853
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:30,659
I'm against it.

854
01:06:31,030 --> 01:06:33,559
Being obsessed with a ghost
like him...

855
01:06:33,559 --> 01:06:35,699
means there's no actual lead
that we can investigate.

856
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,400
He's not the accomplice.

857
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:40,400
I'm positive. Trust me on this.

858
01:06:40,699 --> 01:06:42,039
Mr. Do.

859
01:06:43,969 --> 01:06:45,340
Trust us.

860
01:06:46,139 --> 01:06:47,809
We'll do our best...

861
01:06:48,539 --> 01:06:50,750
to protect your identity.

862
01:06:52,650 --> 01:06:54,480
So please put your safety first.

863
01:07:33,650 --> 01:07:34,789
Why are you looking at me?

864
01:07:37,190 --> 01:07:39,760
Did you have to say that to Hae Su?

865
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:42,599
Do you know how hurt she was?

866
01:07:44,230 --> 01:07:47,230
Of course not.
There's no way you'd know.

867
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,699
I said that
because this was dangerous.

868
01:07:50,969 --> 01:07:53,139
Then you should've said that
instead.

869
01:07:53,139 --> 01:07:55,239
You should've told her that
you didn't want her to get hurt.

870
01:07:56,409 --> 01:07:57,650
Right now,

871
01:07:58,349 --> 01:08:00,780
she's more than willing to dive in
if it's dangerous.

872
01:08:02,519 --> 01:08:03,920
Then what about me?

873
01:08:05,389 --> 01:08:07,460
Why did you drag me into this
if it's that dangerous?

874
01:08:08,989 --> 01:08:10,260
I only asked.

875
01:08:11,059 --> 01:08:12,590
You were the one who said yes.

876
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:17,000
You're right. Why in the world
did I agree to help you?

877
01:08:18,329 --> 01:08:20,500
Because I asked for your help
in front of Hae Su.

878
01:08:22,439 --> 01:08:25,010
You can never say no to me
when she's around.

879
01:08:26,340 --> 01:08:27,810
You want her to like you.

880
01:08:30,710 --> 01:08:33,649
What? Are you saying
that I was manipulated by you?

881
01:08:34,420 --> 01:08:36,920
Yes. You were always like that,

882
01:08:38,020 --> 01:08:39,250
and you'll probably continue
to do so.

Yeom Sang Chul targeted those
who had no families...

894
01:09:38,479 --> 01:09:41,880
or had a history
of running away from them.

895
01:09:42,149 --> 01:09:44,420
It's highly likely that those
who are abducted right now...

896
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:48,020
may also have never been
reported missing.

897
01:10:00,770 --> 01:10:03,239
- Come out.
- What?

898
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:05,640
I said, come out.

899
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:08,039
You have no right to be here.

900
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:12,850
- Sir.
- What's going on?

901
01:10:14,449 --> 01:10:15,479
Detective Choi.

902
01:10:16,350 --> 01:10:18,720
Let me go. Let go and talk.

903
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:20,189
Choi Jae Seop, let her go.

904
01:10:20,449 --> 01:10:21,659
What are you doing right now?

905
01:10:24,789 --> 01:10:26,130
You knew, didn't you?

906
01:10:30,529 --> 01:10:31,630
About what?

907
01:10:32,899 --> 01:10:34,399
You knew everything, didn't you?

908
01:10:40,939 --> 01:10:42,140
How could you?

909
01:10:44,180 --> 01:10:46,109
How could you do this?

910
01:10:49,180 --> 01:10:50,319
You knew everything.

911
01:10:52,390 --> 01:10:53,590
We were manipulated by you...

912

all along.

913

don't get hurt.

923
01:12:00,689 --> 01:12:02,789
I want you off this case.
It's only right.

924
01:12:02,890 --> 01:12:04,489
I'm sorry for visiting
at such late hours.

My name is Do Hae Su.

Don't go home.

927
01:12:08,529 --> 01:12:10,229
Go as far away as possible tonight.

928
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:13,229
Detective Choi found proof
that you're Do Hyun Su.

929
01:12:13,430 --> 01:12:15,670
Go somewhere even I can't find...

930
01:12:16,199 --> 01:12:18,140
and never come back.
