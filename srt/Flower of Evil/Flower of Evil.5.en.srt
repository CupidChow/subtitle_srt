Where's the lighter?

00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,569
Excuse me.

13
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:36,670
During the last blackout,

14
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,000
a burglar robbed the fruit store
just across us.

15
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:42,739
But the burglar wasn't caught.

You're the one
who made a move on me first!

24

When I tell my friends that story,

25
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,469
they tell me
you're interested in me.

26
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:57,479
I became the bigger person
and confessed first.

27
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,009
How dare you play hard to get?

28
00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:01,750
I hate playing hard to get.

29

32
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,050
or sleep out here?

33
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:12,460
Who are you to tell me what to do?

34
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:15,060
Why do you care where I am?

35
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:18,529
Why do you call me?

When you don't go home, your mother
keeps getting anxious with me.

Give me a piggyback.

38

- What?
- I have no energy to walk home.

39
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:34,850
Give me a piggyback
and take me home.

40
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,350
Mister.

41
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,319
Just go on your way.

42
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,560
You shouldn't talk to a woman
you're not interested in.

44

at a farming equipment storage

Did you call a taxi?

59

No. I didn't call one.

60
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:38,439
Then why is that taxi
idling in front of our place?

61
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:44,110
I'll go ask them since I needed one.

62
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:58,689
Get in.

63
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,129

66
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:16,839
Should I forward this watch
to forensics?

67
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:39,060
Hi.

68
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,129
I truly wanted to meet you.

69
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:46,000
How were you so well hidden?

70
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:49,410
What do you want?

71
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,310
Jung Mi Sook.

72
00:07:55,579 --> 00:07:56,750
"Jung Mi Sook".

73
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,750
"Jung Mi Sook".
I swear it sounds familiar.

74
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:03,189
"Jung Mi Sook"?

75
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,319
- Isn't that the woman?
- What?

76
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,990
Her body wasn't found.

77
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:12,060
Gosh, I'm scared to even
say her name out loud.

78
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:14,329
You're right.
She was Do Min Seok's last victim.

79
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:17,769
Darn it. Stop moving.

80
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:22,139
I know neither you nor Jung Mi Sook.

81
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:25,040
Oh, dear. I guess you don't.

82
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,139
I feel bad.

83
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:30,410
I killed Nam Soon Gil for nothing.

84
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:40,259
Either pick it up or reject it.

85
00:08:52,669 --> 00:08:55,039
- Yes?
- I know who Jung Mi Sook is.

86
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:57,240
She was Do Min Seok's last victim.

87
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,179
What?

88
00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:01,909
That means
the culprit is her husband.

89
00:09:02,379 --> 00:09:03,450
Where are you right now?

90
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,690
- I'm...
- Tell me.

91
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,490
You don't need to know.
I'm hanging up.

92
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:21,000
Your kid must've grown
quite a bit. Is it a girl or a boy?

A murder fugitive got married
and even has a kid.

94
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,720
I have nothing to do
with what Do Min Seok has done.

95
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,519
Of course, you don't.

96
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,460
However,

97
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:49,860
tell me what kind of compensation
you want, and I'll give it to you.

98
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:52,700
Who knows?

99
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:55,799
We could find a middle ground.

100
00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:44,809
Goodness, what's going on?

101
00:11:48,009 --> 00:11:49,149
It's mine.

102
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:54,820
I had been looking for it.
I must've dropped it there.

103
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,250
Thank you.

104
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,159
No problem. Goodbye, then.

"Wiretapped"?
You were wiretapped by a culprit?

109
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:15,539
Why don't you ask him to catch
other suspects for you as well?

110
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,309
I'm so mortified.

111
00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:19,779
Please don't get so worked up.
We should catch Park Gyung Chun.

- We'll have to endure them.

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,320
Hey.

116
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,259
Chief!

117
00:12:32,259 --> 00:12:34,529
I'm going to kill him
before I kill myself!

118
00:12:34,529 --> 00:12:36,990
Don't you know how many cases
I've solved so far?

119
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,929
How could you be so harsh
because of one mistake I made?

120
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,070
"Mistake"? How could a detective
make a mistake?

121
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:44,539
- Let me go!
- That's enough, sir.

122
00:12:44,669 --> 00:12:46,570
Fine. I'll stop, so let me go.

123
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,139
Hey, aren't you going
to investigate?

124
00:12:48,139 --> 00:12:49,669
- You should, right?
- Yes, sir.

125
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:51,940
Hey!

126
00:12:57,379 --> 00:12:59,980
How dare you humiliate
the police like this?

127
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,450
I have a sensitive scalp! Let me go!

128
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:05,120
How could you let a culprit use you?

129
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,860
- Let me go on the count of three.
- No.

130
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,389
- 1, 2, 3.
- 2, 3.

131
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:10,789
Let me go.

132
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,600
How dare you grab
your superior's hair?

133
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,759
This is an act of self-defense!

134
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,129
- This is excessive self-defense!
- Please stop...

135
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,669
- How dare you rip my hair out?
- Please stop...

136
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,309
I said, stop, you pigs!

137
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,149
We need to catch Park Gyung Chun
by tonight.

138
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:37,090
The press is going
to ridicule us tomorrow.

139
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:38,590
We should at least
catch the culprit...

140
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:40,990
so that we can save face
and give our briefing.

141
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,100
So what's your plan?

142
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,769
Park Gyung Chun
works for a taxi service.

143
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,269
We've already contacted
that tachograph manufacturer.

144
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,570
We've already gotten...

145
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,340
his call records
and credit card statement.

146
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:56,269
Team Five is looking...

147
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:58,440
into his family
and financial affairs.

148
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:02,950
Listen carefully.
We must catch him at all costs.

149
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:05,820
If some other station catches him...

150
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,990
or if you fail to catch him
by tonight,

151
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,220
you'll be the first one
to shave your head...

152
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,659
in front of the public, got it?

153
00:14:13,659 --> 00:14:17,090
And about the wiretapping incident,
make sure words don't spread.

154
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:18,700
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

155
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:20,759
Find him! I don't want to see
any of you. Go work now.

156
00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:22,669
- Hey, look into it again.
- Okay.

157
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,100
Let's hurry.

158
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,610
Darn it.

159
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:30,309
Where are you right now?

160
00:14:30,909 --> 00:14:34,039
We got a call about a taxi driver
abducting a civilian,

161
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,210
so we're on our way.

162
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,580
We'll be able to track
Park Gyung Chun soon.

163
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:39,820
Be on standby so that
you can move immediately.

164
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,649
Yes, sir.

165
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,950
Do Hyun Su!

166
00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:09,110
Ji Won.

167
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:12,379
About that watch
the constable gave you...

168
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:17,049
- What?
- Since when did you carry around...

169
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:18,190
a spare watch?

170
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,230
Oh, that? The strap tore off,

171
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:28,169
so I brought it with me
to get it fixed.

172
00:15:28,169 --> 00:15:30,029
I put it in my pocket
and forgot about it.

173
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,870
I've never seen it before.

174
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,570
When did you get it?

175
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,470
It looked quite expensive.

176
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:38,639
It's my husband's.

177
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,009
I told him I'd get it fixed
on my way to work.

178
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,649
Didn't you say it was yours
a while ago?

179
00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:53,259
What's mine is his and vice versa.

180
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,330
Why are you obsessing
over something so trivial?

181
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:57,960
We have no time for this.

182
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,870
By the way...

183
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,440
Can you please stop?

184
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,610
What? What is it?

185
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:11,409
Why are you so curious
about that watch?

186
00:16:11,409 --> 00:16:14,110
No... No, that's not why.

187
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,779
You're not wearing the seat belt.
Wear it.

188
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,419
Why would you cut me off like that?

189
00:16:30,929 --> 00:16:32,029
Come on.

190
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:34,570
Take good care
of that head of yours. I'm done.

191
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,740
"That head of yours"?

192
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,940
I'm no longer the Kim Mu Jin
from the past.

193
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,610
This head
that you stitched up today...

194
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:49,549
wasn't injured
due to some competition.

195
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:53,649
I injured it while chasing
after a killer.

196
00:16:54,049 --> 00:16:57,919
That man was determined
to find his late wife's killer,

197
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,059
and he's finally done it.

198
00:17:01,289 --> 00:17:03,429
I'm sure the problem is in his mind.

199
00:17:04,259 --> 00:17:06,200
I should go work now.

200
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,829
I hope Do Hyun Su
gets caught soon.

201
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,269
What does this have to do with him?

202
00:17:12,269 --> 00:17:14,539
They need to catch him
in order to find her body.

203
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,039
Why?

204
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,940
Gosh, you're so dense.

205
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,910
He must know where the body
is buried since he was in on it...

206
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,250
alongside his dad.

207
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,549
That's what you call a witch-hunt.

208
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:29,250
They concluded it
as Do Min Seok's singlehanded crime.

209
00:17:29,819 --> 00:17:33,789
You know, Do Hyun Su isn't
a serial murderer.

210
00:17:33,789 --> 00:17:34,789
He's just a murderer.

211
00:17:34,789 --> 00:17:36,930
They killed together.
What are you talking about?

212
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:39,230
Implicating someone
in a crime like that...

213
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:41,059
isn't the recent trend, sir.

214
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:43,569
How could you be so ignorant
when you're a reporter?

215
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,769
Come on, you should know better
than to make false rumors.

216
00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:50,910
Do you really not know?

217
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:53,109
Know what?

218
00:17:54,579 --> 00:17:55,779
Well...

219
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:59,680
My goodness, how frustrating.

220
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,490
Man, I'm the one who's frustrated
right now.

221
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:03,849
What? What do I not know?

222
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,089
Was it this person?

223
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,829
Yes, it was him.

224
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,730
He was assaulting my guest
and dragged him somewhere.

225
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,359
I was terrified.

226
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:19,140
Yes, sir. It was Park Gyung Chun.

227
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,480
Do you know who the victim is?

228
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:27,339
No. He seemed like someone
out of town.

229
00:18:27,609 --> 00:18:29,579
He said he just came
to clear his head.

230
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,009
How did he pay?

231
00:18:31,549 --> 00:18:33,779
- With cash.
- Did he ask for a receipt?

232
00:18:33,849 --> 00:18:34,990
No, he didn't.

233
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:24,230
I think that phone belongs to him.

234
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,400
They got into a scuffle
at this very spot.

235
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,509
What is it?

236
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,339
Ho Joon, how could this...

237
00:19:34,109 --> 00:19:35,549
I think the abducted victim...

238
00:19:37,849 --> 00:19:39,150
is my husband.

239
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,549
What? What are you talking about?

240
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:45,460
I don't know what I'm saying either.

241
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:49,859
This phone belongs to my husband.

242
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,559
What? How could this...

243
00:19:59,369 --> 00:20:00,599
Was the person who was abducted...

244
00:20:01,569 --> 00:20:02,940
this man?

245
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:06,940
Yes, it's him. I'm certain it's him.

246
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,849
Yes, Detective Choi.

247
00:20:11,049 --> 00:20:13,220
Park Gyung Chun is still nearby.
Where are you guys?

248
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:14,819
We're at the bed and breakfast
beside the fishing spot.

249
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:20,420
Can you track down the location
of Park Gyung Chun's taxi?

250
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,089
What are you doing? Get going now!

251
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,799
Can you move that car?

252
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:32,869
Ji Won!

253
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:54,519
This punk Park Gyung Chun
isn't speeding that much.

254
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:56,329
You seem pretty laid-back.

255
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:59,700
Take the road near the reservoir.
You can catch up to him.

256
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,970
Ji Won, wait!

257
00:22:43,769 --> 00:22:45,069
Ji Won!

258
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:36,019
Ho Joon, wake up. Ho Joon!

259
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:41,190
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

260
00:23:43,329 --> 00:23:44,430
No.

261
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,299
I'm sorry.

262
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:49,730
I forgot you were beside me
for a second.

263
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,539
I must've lost my mind.

264
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:57,210
What is the matter with me?

265
00:23:57,539 --> 00:23:59,140
We don't have time to waste.

266
00:24:00,009 --> 00:24:01,309
We need to find Baek Hee Seong.

267
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:03,509
We do.

268
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,549
Come on, what do I not know?

269
00:24:08,349 --> 00:24:10,420
Tell me what it is.

270
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,559
Why are you so impatient?

271
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:14,859
Hold on.

272
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:17,559
It's time for my medication,

273
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:19,960
so I'll tell you after I take this.

274
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:25,569
Have a seat. Sit down.

275
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,420
So...

276
00:24:42,289 --> 00:24:43,450
The thing is...

277
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:49,960
Are you feeling all right?

278
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:53,700
I'm from Yeonju Police Station.

279
00:24:54,529 --> 00:24:56,500
I need to ask you questions
regarding...

280
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,970
the trespassing and burglary case
at Ms. Oh Bok Ja's residence.

281
00:24:59,099 --> 00:25:00,140
I need to take your statements too.

282
00:25:00,369 --> 00:25:02,039
- Okay.
- Hey, Kyung Sik.

283
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,309
You tell him.

284
00:25:04,539 --> 00:25:05,609
What?

285
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,579
When he was a constable,

286
00:25:07,579 --> 00:25:09,680
he was a member of the
serial murder investigation team.

287
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:13,779
And this is a reporter from Seoul.

288
00:25:16,049 --> 00:25:17,720
Why don't you tell him?

289
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:20,160
He says he won't go home
until I tell him.

290
00:25:21,089 --> 00:25:22,289
Tell him what?

291
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,230
You know, about that.

292
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,569
Oh, that?

293
00:25:30,569 --> 00:25:31,640
Sir.

294
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:34,569
I can't tell civilians about that.

295
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:38,140
Come on, it's been 18 years.
What's the big deal?

296
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:43,009
Well...

297
00:25:46,619 --> 00:25:47,950
It's quite strange.

298
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:49,589
It really is.

299
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:52,019
This is driving me nuts.

300
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,559
Can you please let me in on it too?

301
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,099
A witness.

302
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:03,329
A witness?

303
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:05,970
What witness?

304
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,450
Baek Hee Seong.

305
00:27:03,259 --> 00:27:04,559
"Baek Hee Seong".

306
00:27:11,869 --> 00:27:14,769
Why does Do Hyun Su have
a driver's license...

307
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,309
under Baek Hee Seong's name?

308
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:20,180
Why is that?

309
00:27:37,829 --> 00:27:39,799
Did you change your identity?

310
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,170
No one would've imagined...

311
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:53,509
that a serial murderer...

312
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:57,049
would have changed his identity,
got married,

313
00:27:57,049 --> 00:27:58,349
and had a child.

314
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,849
Who would've thought you would...

315
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:04,150
get a haircut on a regular basis?

316
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,329
Should I tell you something
to make you even more jealous?

317
00:28:17,069 --> 00:28:18,869
I have a two-story house in Seoul.

318
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:20,700
I own it.

319
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:23,240
Of course...

320
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:26,880
the bank has a bigger share for now.

321
00:28:32,819 --> 00:28:33,980
Are you laughing?

322
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:41,990
It's so pathetic.

323
00:28:44,589 --> 00:28:46,029
What's pathetic?

324
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:52,440
The one you wanted to avenge died,

325
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:56,940
and you have yet to find a channel
to let out your rage.

326
00:28:57,869 --> 00:29:01,480
Do Min Seok's son Do Hyun Su
must have been the best target.

327
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,750
"He's just like his father."

328
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:10,690
"He's possessed by an evil spirit."

329
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:12,359
"He went to see a psychiatrist."

330
00:29:12,619 --> 00:29:14,220
"He doesn't have the heart
of a human."

331
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:16,160
"The two of them
stay together all day long."

332
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,690
The two of them
stay together all day long.

333
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:19,200
He's just like his father.

334
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,759
- He's possessed by an evil spirit.
- I heard he saw a psychiatrist.

335
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:24,500
"He knew everything about
what his father did."

336
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:26,440
"They did it together."

337
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,210
Am I wrong?

338
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:38,079
You're just as I heard.

339
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:41,549
Are you really fearless?

340
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:43,990
Don't you know...

341
00:29:44,789 --> 00:29:47,319
I could kill you
with a single stroke?

342
00:29:52,329 --> 00:29:55,529
Of course,
I'm not scared of an opponent...

343
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:58,170
whom I can see right through.

344
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,109
It's boring.

345
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:11,920
You can feel pain though, right?

346
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:22,160
I'll...

347
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:26,500
continue to exert pain on you
until you give me the right answer.

348
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,599
Tell me.

349
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,700
Where's Jung Mi Sook?

350
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:41,039
It was really risky...

351
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,109
What?

352
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,019
Say that again.

353
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:50,250
It was really...

354
00:31:14,779 --> 00:31:15,849
Revenge?

355
00:31:20,549 --> 00:31:23,119
You failed completely.

356
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,990
You'll fail even if you kill me.

357
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:28,990
Even if you cut my limbs off...

358
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:32,029
and make holes in my body,
you'll still fail.

359
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:33,700
Because...

360
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,970
you don't have the ability...

361
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:40,039
to prove...

362
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,710
what I didn't do
and what I don't know about.

363
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,539
Do you understand?

364
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:00,759
It's obvious what you'll do to me.

365
00:32:03,029 --> 00:32:04,130
But...

366
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:09,069
I'm curious to see...

367
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:12,500
how you'll break down.

368
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:17,240
Why don't you show me?

369
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:53,880
Hey, are you okay?
Are you guys okay?

370
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,309
We're okay.

371
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:57,680
More than that, we must find...

372
00:32:58,079 --> 00:32:59,650
Park Gyung Chun as soon as possible.

373
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:00,779
We increased the inspection points.

374
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:03,950
We have detectives on stakeouts
at Park Gyung Chun's house,

375
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:05,019
work, and acquaintances
he's been in touch with.

376
00:33:05,019 --> 00:33:07,019
We requested for Park's
operation record,

377
00:33:07,019 --> 00:33:08,660
so we'll find out something soon.

378
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:11,230
Before that, have you identified
the victim?

379
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,200
I think it's my husband.

380
00:33:17,299 --> 00:33:18,900
What? What are you saying?

381
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,970
The abducted victim is Hee Seong.

382
00:33:22,069 --> 00:33:23,910
What? Why?

383
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:27,339
I don't know. I don't know.

384
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,150
I don't know anything right now.

385
00:33:29,609 --> 00:33:33,119
I don't know why he was staying
at the bed and breakfast.

386
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:36,289
The owner just said
that he came on vacation.

387
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:40,859
What should I do?

388
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:43,589
Tell me what to do.
I have to do something.

389
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,359
Otherwise, I might go insane.

390
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:50,400
How could that jerk touch
the family member of a detective?

391
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,339
I said, what do I have to do?

392
00:33:52,339 --> 00:33:55,299
- Please, calm down.
- How can I calm down right now?

393
00:33:57,569 --> 00:34:00,380
If he abducted your husband, he must
have a place to confine him.

394
00:34:00,779 --> 00:34:02,109
He's a taxi driver.

395
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:05,150
He must know abandoned factories,
buildings, and redevelopment areas.

396
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:08,179
There are hundreds
of possibilities just in Seoul.

397
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:11,219
We'll be able to figure it out
with the operation record.

398
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:12,960
When we get the record?

399
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:16,460
Okay.

400
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:18,929
Of course,
we'll be able to find him,

401
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:21,400
including my mutilated husband!

402
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:26,039
- Ji Won.
- Hey.

403
00:34:27,269 --> 00:34:29,309
It's not Park Gyung Chun
I want to find.

404
00:34:29,309 --> 00:34:32,039
I want to find my husband
while he's alive!

405
00:34:33,809 --> 00:34:36,679
You saw how Park Gyung Chun
killed Nam Soon Gil.

406
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:37,909
We're doing our best.

407
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:40,250
I'm sure you know this already.

408
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,719
You dealt with murderers
like Park before.

409
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:46,360
You caught the criminal of
the kidnapping case last year...

410
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:48,159
even before a suspect was specified.

411
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:51,690
Hey, that was... I just caught him
with my animal instinct.

412
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:54,699
I was going around questioning
when he and I met eyes.

413
00:34:54,699 --> 00:34:57,599
That's why I got goosebumps
all over my arms.

414
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:01,469
That's why you tailed him
to find the evidence.

415
00:35:02,469 --> 00:35:05,070
I'm sure people like him
have peculiarities or habits.

416
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:07,340
Instead of just sitting and waiting,

417
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:09,710
tell me what I can do right now.

418
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:11,909
Please think of something for me.

419
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,480
How can I do that right now?

420
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:17,750
Hold on.

421
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,559
What made me suspect him?

422
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,059
Why was he suspicious?

423
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:28,130
Why, Ji Won?

424
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:35,170
Right. That's right.

425
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:37,139
You two,

426
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:40,539
meet me at Park Gyung Chun's house
right now. Hurry!

427
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,179
"Abducted"?

428
00:35:47,349 --> 00:35:49,420
Who abducted him?

429
00:35:49,489 --> 00:35:52,690
We believe it's the suspect of
the Chinese Restaurant Murder Case.

430
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,159
We're investigating.

431
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:56,789
What does that case have anything
to do with Baek Hee Seong?

432
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:01,860
Why did that murderer
abduct our son, sir?

433
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,400
Have you heard
of the name "Do Hyun Su"?

434
00:36:10,369 --> 00:36:13,579
No, it's my first time hearing it.

435
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:17,510
He's a man who murdered
the village foreman in Yeonju...

436
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:18,980
18 years ago
and is currently on the run.

437
00:36:19,449 --> 00:36:23,019
Also, do you remember
the serial murder case...

438
00:36:23,789 --> 00:36:24,920
in that region?

439
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,360
No, I don't.

440
00:36:26,989 --> 00:36:28,219
Yes.

441
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,889
I remember it vaguely.

442
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:35,030
Do Hyun Su is the son
of the serial killer,

443
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,829
Do Min Seok.

444
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:39,940
So?

445
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:44,010
What does this have to do
with Do Hyun Su?

446
00:36:45,409 --> 00:36:48,409
The kidnapper only has one purpose.

447
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:51,409
Do Hyun Su.

448
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:53,980
We believe he's making it seem
like Do Hyun Su...

449
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,380
has committed the murders.

450
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,420
He wants the police
to find the latter.

451
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:01,789
We believe he abducted your son
for the same purpose.

452
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,489
So what is he trying to do...

453
00:37:04,489 --> 00:37:07,460
with Do Hyun Su?

454
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:08,630
Honey.

455
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:10,230
Let's leave that...

456
00:37:11,269 --> 00:37:13,599
to the detectives.

457
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:21,880
Our top priority right now
is to rescue your son.

458
00:37:22,179 --> 00:37:26,119
Our men will be here just in case
something happens.

459
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,579
Okay.

460
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,050
Please...

461
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:34,219
rescue our son.

462
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:36,889
We will.

463
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:58,110
That was easier than I had expected.

464
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:00,320
- Sorry?
- Usually...

465
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,420
during situations like this,
it's quite difficult...

466
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:06,420
to talk with the victim's family.

467
00:38:07,889 --> 00:38:10,630
They beg you to find their child.

468
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:13,460
They show their discontent
with the investigation.

469
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:16,469
I found it strange as well.

470
00:38:16,929 --> 00:38:18,969
It seemed like
they were more concerned...

471
00:38:18,969 --> 00:38:20,900
about the case than their son.

472
00:38:21,469 --> 00:38:23,769
But then again, we don't know...

473
00:38:23,769 --> 00:38:25,510
about their relationships
with one another.

474
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,179
Let's go.

475
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:33,380
This is driving me crazy.

476
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:36,590
What in the world is he doing?

477
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:41,059
I told you we should keep him
under our roof.

478
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:44,030
That wouldn't have changed anything.

479
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:49,170
We knew this would happen
since he had a past.

480
00:39:12,789 --> 00:39:15,119
The culprit knew that he was Hyun Su
and kidnapped him.

481
00:39:15,389 --> 00:39:16,460
I'm sure of it.

482
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,730
What should we do now?

483
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,030
Once the culprit gets caught,

484
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:24,969
everyone will know
that Hyun Su took...

485
00:39:24,969 --> 00:39:26,400
our son's identity.

486
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,139
If something happens to us,

487
00:39:29,969 --> 00:39:31,670
who will take care of him?

488
00:39:33,909 --> 00:39:34,940
I'm certain...

489
00:39:37,179 --> 00:39:39,550
that he will kill Hyun Su.

490
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:43,150
What?

491
00:39:47,989 --> 00:39:49,059
Listen carefully.

492
00:39:50,659 --> 00:39:53,329
If Hyun Su dies,

493
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:56,869
you and I will be the only ones
who'll know the truth.

494
00:39:58,099 --> 00:40:03,010
We'll just be an old couple
who was threatened by him.

495
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:04,710
They'll think we're innocent.

496
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,750
We'll pretend that we didn't know
he was the son of a serial killer,

497
00:40:10,309 --> 00:40:12,579
was wanted for murder,

498
00:40:12,849 --> 00:40:15,650
or was Do Hyun Su to begin with.

499
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:22,389
They will understand us.

500
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,420
How much time do you think
you'll have...

501
00:40:55,989 --> 00:40:57,989
before you drown?

502
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:00,829
The good news, however,

503
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:04,469
is that you still have time
to tell the truth.

504
00:41:11,369 --> 00:41:12,469
Like I've said before,

505
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,639
I can't prove something I didn't do.

506
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,750
May 12, 2002.

507
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:21,380
It was a Sunday,
and the weather was lovely.

508
00:41:21,849 --> 00:41:23,619
Whether it be going for a walk
or on a date,

509
00:41:24,219 --> 00:41:26,119
everyone wanted to go outside.

510
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,460
What did you do that day?

511
00:41:30,929 --> 00:41:34,599
Are you playing games with me?

512
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:39,699
That's the day Mi Sook went missing.

513
00:41:41,639 --> 00:41:44,010
It was a black SUV
with numbers 3194.

514
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:48,010
On the day of her disappearance,
she was in that vehicle.

515
00:41:48,309 --> 00:41:51,909
Right. I bet you know the vehicle
since it was your dad's.

516
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:07,699
Goodness. This time,

517
00:42:07,929 --> 00:42:09,869
I'll serve you some French wine.

518
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:13,500
Mu Jin, didn't you say
we'd just have a drink or two?

519
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:17,269
Who knew we'd click so well?

520
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:18,369
You're right.

521
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:22,110
But I think
I've talked too much today.

522
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:27,119
Don't tell me
this is all for your work.

523
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,650
What do you take me for?

524
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:32,690
- Okay.
- What?

525
00:42:33,219 --> 00:42:34,960
- Here.
- Okay.

526
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:37,030
What else?

527
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,530
- Where is it?
- What's wrong?

528
00:42:40,659 --> 00:42:43,599
My voice recorder.
I swear I put it in here.

529
00:42:43,829 --> 00:42:46,340
You're being very suspicious.

530
00:42:49,809 --> 00:42:51,840
Fine, I'll give you
an arrest warrant.

531
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:54,280
Please do a body search.

532
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:56,909
I'm really going to do it, okay?

533
00:42:57,949 --> 00:43:00,750
Forget it. I believe you. Sit down.

534
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:01,880
Here.

535
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:04,989
Let's drink.

536
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:08,420
I'm going to make sure
you blackout tonight.

537
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:11,190
Let me stop by the restroom.

538
00:43:11,389 --> 00:43:12,489
Sure.

539
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:28,610
"2002... May..."

540
00:43:30,679 --> 00:43:32,920
"May 12,"

541
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:35,480
"2002".

542
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:37,690
"2am".

543
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:41,989
"Sehyeon 2-dong".

544
00:43:43,289 --> 00:43:45,659
The witness, "Jang Young Hee".

545
00:43:45,659 --> 00:43:47,000
(May 12, 2002, 2am,
Sehyeon 2-dong, Jang Young Hee)

546
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
"Worked at JNQ Hotel".

547
00:43:55,469 --> 00:43:57,539
This is getting
more and more interesting.

548
00:44:21,329 --> 00:44:23,900
At an intersection
in Sehyeon 2-dong at 2am,

549
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:26,840
there was a witness...

550
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:29,070
who saw Mi Sook get forced
into Do Min Seok's vehicle.

551
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:32,309
The witness memorized
the license plate number...

552
00:44:32,309 --> 00:44:33,840
and reported it to the police.

553
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:37,010
As a result, Do Min Seok
was brought in for questioning.

554
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:39,619
But the charges were dropped.

555
00:44:45,619 --> 00:44:46,920
That's because...

556
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:51,460
his son gave a perfect alibi
for his dad.

557
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:57,000
Had the police arrested him then,
my wife wouldn't have died.

558
00:44:57,969 --> 00:45:00,570
That was the last chance
to save her.

559
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:02,300
I only told the truth.

560
00:45:03,809 --> 00:45:05,769
From that morning
until the next day,

561
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:09,780
I was with my dad the whole time.

562
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:13,349
I repeatedly told...

563
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:16,949
the same details
of what happened every 10 minutes.

564
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:22,289
If that's true,

565
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:26,429
then I guess his vehicle
drove around...

566
00:45:26,429 --> 00:45:28,099
and abducted people.

567
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:30,369
That's quite common.

568
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:32,969
Why do you leave out the parts...

569
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:37,570
about the witness being drunk
and changing the testimony?

570
00:45:39,579 --> 00:45:41,510
My testimony was consistent,

571
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:44,380
but that witness changed hers.

572
00:45:44,849 --> 00:45:46,349
She said she couldn't remember.

573
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:50,519
Killing me...

574
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:54,219
won't fill up that empty hole
in your imagination.

575
00:46:05,769 --> 00:46:08,670
Why... Why do you have...

576
00:46:08,969 --> 00:46:10,269
Looks familiar, right?

577
00:46:12,039 --> 00:46:14,239
Mi Sook had the same one.

578
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,309
But Nam Soon Gil said
that you had it.

579
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:19,679
Why?

580
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,389
Has the cat got your tongue?

581
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:28,590
Tell me!

582
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,559
Who could've been the person...

583
00:46:30,559 --> 00:46:33,199
who had access to
Mi Sook's belongings...

584
00:46:33,829 --> 00:46:34,960
until the moment she disappeared?

585
00:46:36,099 --> 00:46:37,170
Who do you think?

586
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:46,909
(The Late Do Min Seok)

587
00:46:53,619 --> 00:46:54,719
Hyun Su.

588
00:47:02,889 --> 00:47:03,989
What is this?

589
00:47:05,659 --> 00:47:08,860
A golden fish brings you good luck.

590
00:47:12,099 --> 00:47:13,539
Always keep it with you.

591
00:47:19,579 --> 00:47:21,239
Ms. Do Hae Su, are you in there?

592
00:47:23,179 --> 00:47:25,150
Ms. Do, do you have time
for an interview?

593
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:28,280
The people have the right to know.

594
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:32,090
Do Hyun Su is currently receiving
the national spotlight again.

595
00:47:32,219 --> 00:47:35,059
People are suspecting you're
aiding his escape.

596
00:47:38,659 --> 00:47:40,159
- There she is!
- She's coming out.

597
00:47:40,329 --> 00:47:42,000
- There she is.
- Get the camera.

598
00:47:44,369 --> 00:47:45,570
Please leave.

599
00:47:45,929 --> 00:47:47,070
I don't know anything.

600
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:50,070
You were 19 when Do Min Seok
committed those serial murders.

601
00:47:50,269 --> 00:47:52,710
Did you really not know your father
was a serial murderer?

602
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:54,510
No, I didn't know.

603
00:47:56,010 --> 00:47:57,150
What about your college?

604
00:47:57,150 --> 00:47:59,079
After your father was found
as a serial murderer...

605
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:01,679
and your brother ran away
after killing the village foreman,

606
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:03,590
you were admitted to art school.

607
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:05,250
It was a prestigious school
everyone envied.

608
00:48:05,719 --> 00:48:08,119
Do you have something to say
to the families of the victims?

609
00:48:10,789 --> 00:48:11,889
I'm sorry.

610
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:15,760
Wait! If you don't have anything
to do with Do Hyun Su's escape,

611
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:17,900
how about you show your face
confidently?

612
00:48:18,929 --> 00:48:20,369
I can tell you're very pretty.

613
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:26,679
I'm sorry.

614
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:29,710
Wait! Please say something.

615
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:31,650
Ms. Do.

616
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:33,750
Is that the attitude of someone
who's sorry?

617
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:35,219
At least she's hot.

618
00:48:56,070 --> 00:48:57,969
During the abduction case
in Jua-dong,

619
00:48:57,969 --> 00:48:59,880
I thought about why
I obsessed over him so much.

620
00:49:00,039 --> 00:49:01,139
And then it struck me.

621
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:03,550
The culprit lived in
a redevelopment district,

622
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:05,110
but had a very fancy door lock.

623
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:06,750
It was obvious
he changed it recently.

624
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:07,880
He was about to move out soon,

625
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:10,320
but it had an automatic locking
and fingerprint recognition.

626
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:12,349
In order for Park Gyung Chun
to control his hideout,

627
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:13,920
he probably needs
a sturdy locking device too.

628
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,590
That's right. He probably called
a technician...

629
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:17,659
and paid him.

630
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:20,230
Once you ransack
Park Gyung Chun's place,

631
00:49:20,329 --> 00:49:21,429
I'm sure you'll find something.

632
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:39,079
Explain yourself!

633
00:49:39,579 --> 00:49:42,920
Tell me why you have Mi Sook's
belonging.

634
00:49:56,570 --> 00:49:59,670
Why? Why can't you tell me?

635
00:50:00,199 --> 00:50:02,570
You kept blabbering on all this time
without even batting an eye.

636
00:50:02,570 --> 00:50:05,670
But why can't you explain
why you have this?

637
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:10,809
Why?

638
00:50:12,949 --> 00:50:15,219
Where is Jung Mi Sook?

639
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:32,230
It's over there.

640
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:41,079
Spread out and search.

641
00:51:15,579 --> 00:51:16,710
Take a look at this.

642
00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:20,980
Find the rest of that number.

643
00:51:27,789 --> 00:51:29,090
Here it is.

644
00:51:35,159 --> 00:51:37,000
(Contact Number for Inquiries)

645
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:38,670
Oh, I remember.

646
00:51:38,969 --> 00:51:40,570
It has been a long time since...

647
00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:42,170
the construction stopped
at that building.

648
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,869
He asked me to install a door lock,
so I did think it was strange.

649
00:51:59,389 --> 00:52:01,789
Just tell me
where you buried Mi Sook.

650
00:52:03,019 --> 00:52:06,260
Then I'll spare your life.

651
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:08,699
I don't know.

652
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:12,469
If you think of yourself
as a human being,

653
00:52:14,099 --> 00:52:15,639
shouldn't you at least...

654
00:52:16,070 --> 00:52:18,139
live properly for one moment?

655
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,010
She's waiting for me...

656
00:52:22,610 --> 00:52:24,679
to take her out of that cold,
dark place...

657
00:52:24,679 --> 00:52:26,250
right this instant.

658
00:52:27,449 --> 00:52:29,320
Imagine how much she's been waiting.

659
00:52:31,619 --> 00:52:33,289
Please tell me, I beg of you.

660
00:52:34,590 --> 00:52:35,789
Please tell me.

661
00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:37,889
It wasn't me.

662
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:16,360
It's a taxi.

663
00:53:21,369 --> 00:53:23,139
Call backup and guard that exit.

664
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:28,110
We've located Park Gyung Chun.
Please send backup.

665
00:53:28,110 --> 00:53:29,179
Move!

666
00:54:27,170 --> 00:54:29,840
Park Gyung Chun,
you are under arrest...

667
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:32,809
for the murder of Nam Soon Gil
and abduction of Baek Hee Seong.

668
00:55:18,949 --> 00:55:20,119
No!

669
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:23,360
Park Gyung Chun!

670
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:25,829
Shoot him. Shoot him now.

671
00:55:26,699 --> 00:55:27,699
Drop the knife.

672
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:29,530
Drop the knife!

673
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:37,940
Shoot. Just shoot!

674
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:39,010
Try and shoot!

675
00:55:39,010 --> 00:55:40,239
We'll see who dies.

676
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:23,489
Shoot. Just shoot.

677
00:56:23,889 --> 00:56:25,019
Move.

678
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:27,059
Move it!

679
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:52,510
Detective Choi, wake up.

680
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:54,849
Detective Choi!

681
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:22,980
Should I tell you?

682
00:57:24,579 --> 00:57:26,110
What kind of person I am?

683
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:33,090
I couldn't graduate
from high school.

684
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:36,019
Why not?

685
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:39,090
Just because.
I couldn't adjust to it.

686
00:57:41,199 --> 00:57:42,900
I lived on the streets before too.

687
00:57:44,070 --> 00:57:47,670
Back then,
I'd get into fights every day.

688
00:57:50,139 --> 00:57:52,139
Have you ever punched someone
with your fist?

689
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:55,280
No.

690
00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:58,010
I've punched someone
so frantically...

691
00:57:58,010 --> 00:57:59,610
that I didn't realize
my hand was being grazed.

692
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:03,050
When I did that,

693
00:58:05,849 --> 00:58:07,489
it felt really good.

694
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,190
Also,

695
00:58:26,539 --> 00:58:28,480
I can see things I shouldn't see.

696
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:38,449
I have problems up here.

697
00:58:47,130 --> 00:58:48,400
What do you see?

698
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:54,440
Someone dead.

699
00:58:57,809 --> 00:58:59,139
You must have loved them a lot.

700
00:59:01,610 --> 00:59:04,510
I saw my late grandma
in my dream too.

701
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:09,280
"Grandma, you should go now."

702
00:59:09,949 --> 00:59:12,320
"Stop worrying about me
and go rest."

703
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:15,420
When I said that,
she turned around quietly and left.

704
00:59:17,889 --> 00:59:19,059
You really have...

705
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:22,159
a hard time understanding me.

706
00:59:25,130 --> 00:59:28,170
Are you sorry because you don't
think you're good enough for me?

707
00:59:30,039 --> 00:59:31,440
I don't know such feelings.

708
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,139
There's only one problem with you.

709
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:37,380
You don't see yourself
like the way I see you.

710
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:44,050
I'll like you a lot from now on.

711
00:59:45,289 --> 00:59:46,650
I'll be good to you.

712
00:59:47,619 --> 00:59:49,519
I'll teach you what you don't know.

713
00:59:54,059 --> 00:59:56,400
Then at a certain point,
everything will change...

714
00:59:57,869 --> 00:59:59,170
like a lie.

715
01:00:13,579 --> 01:00:15,050
See? See?

716
01:00:16,219 --> 01:00:18,489
You're staring at me again.

717
01:00:19,050 --> 01:00:20,420
You're making my heart race.

718
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:24,760
But you say you don't like me.

719
01:00:31,199 --> 01:00:32,400
I don't...

720
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:35,239
really get you.

721
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:39,510
Is that...

722
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:43,880
a confession?

723
01:00:50,889 --> 01:00:52,519
It's nice out...

724
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:54,760
and I don't have anything more
to say,

725
01:00:55,019 --> 01:00:56,360
so let's kiss.

726
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:22,079
Father.

727
01:01:23,679 --> 01:01:24,989
You should go now.

728
01:01:26,989 --> 01:01:28,360
I want to stay here.

729
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:31,690
Please. Please leave.

730
01:02:07,699 --> 01:02:09,130
What should we do now?

731
01:02:10,530 --> 01:02:11,800
Do you want to drink?

732
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:49,829
Hee Seong!

733
01:04:00,610 --> 01:04:02,079
Someone help me!

734
01:04:10,150 --> 01:04:11,590
I thought of you.

735
01:04:13,090 --> 01:04:16,320
I was lucky to have met you.

736
01:04:18,190 --> 01:04:19,329
But...

737
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:22,800
it came across my mind
for the first time...

738
01:04:24,730 --> 01:04:27,030
that you should have never met me.

739
01:04:30,369 --> 01:04:31,440
Yes.

740
01:04:32,409 --> 01:04:36,210
Now I understand
what you meant then.

741
01:04:37,010 --> 01:04:38,150
I'm...

742
01:04:43,150 --> 01:04:44,550
sorry.

743
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:12,349
