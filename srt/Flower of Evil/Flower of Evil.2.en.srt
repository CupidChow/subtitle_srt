Let's listen to the song
from the super rookie,

12
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,719
- Jang Yoon Jung's "Oh My".
- Oh My.

"A police officer shall not use
a weapon and use other measures..."

1982?

17
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:17,980
You look very young.

18
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,549
Are you new here?

19
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:24,719
How did you know?

20
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,359
I've never seen you around.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,200
This neighborhood seems like
a nice place to start over.

22
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,400
It's quiet.

23
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:00,890
This time,

24
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:04,129
let's learn about
happy expressions.

25
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:06,230
You must not overdo it.

26
00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:08,030
Can you spot the difference?

27
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:12,000
Number one, wrinkles develop
around your eyes.

28
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:17,840
Number two, your cheeks go up.

29
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:21,509
Number three, you can feel
the wrinkles around your eyes...

30
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,580
move slightly.

31
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:30,520
What do you think?
Do you look happy right now?

32
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,699
(Episode 2)

33
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:22,710
My gosh.

34
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,550
Why are you up so early?

35
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,949
Honey, I had a dream.

36
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,319
A good dream?

37
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,759
A dream about when we first met.

38
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,030
Is this nurungji soup?
It looks yummy.

39
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,229
- Do you want to taste it?
- Yes.

40
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,599
Here.

41
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,240
How could it taste so refreshing?

42
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,909
I made the broth with dried pollack.

43
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,210
- It's all done.
- Can I help you with anything?

44
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,120
Can you take out the diced
radish kimchi from the refrigerator?

45
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,819
Okay.

46
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:11,889
Is it this?

47
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,129
It isn't this one. Is it this?

48
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,199
This is young radish kimchi.

49
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,930
Just leave it. I'll take it out.

50
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:24,769
Can you wake up Eun Ha
and wash her?

51
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,899
Okay.

52
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:35,009
- Mom.
- Yes?

53
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:37,649
Who is bigger? Me or Soo Young?

54
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:39,949
Who was Soo Young again?

55
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,850
You forget everything I tell you.

56
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:44,860
Let's dry your hair now.

57
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,629
It's too hot when you do it.

58
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,329
I want Dad to dry my hair.

59
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,000
He's better.

60
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:54,170
I can do a good job too.

61
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,100
You're not good at anything.

62
00:04:58,769 --> 00:05:01,509
Why isn't there anything?
I'm good at many things.

63
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:05,879
- Dad, dry my hair for me.
- Where's Mom?

64
00:05:06,579 --> 00:05:09,250
She told me it's a secret.

65
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,050
You said you won't keep
any secrets from me.

66
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:14,949
Oh, right.

67
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,389
Where is Mom?

68
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:21,829
Mom said she's going to clean
your workroom.

69
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:23,899
What?

70
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,240
Ji Won.

71
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,250
Did you break a teacup?

72
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:19,220
This one was your favorite.

73
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:26,220
Oh, I was a bit careless.

74
00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:27,959
Give it to me,
you'll hurt your finger.

75
00:06:29,529 --> 00:06:31,699
Let's go and eat.
The food will get cold.

76
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,529
Who did you drink tea with?

77
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,399
It was just a customer.

78
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,310
It wasn't just a customer.

79
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:43,939
It was someone
you were glad to meet.

80
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:46,540
Why do you think so?

81
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:50,050
That's your habit. You serve
cold drinks to normal customers...

82
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,120
and warm tea to someone
you want to chat with.

83
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,290
I'm like that?

84
00:06:55,389 --> 00:06:57,519
I know you better than yourself.

85
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:01,230
Who did you drink tea and chat with?

86
00:07:02,329 --> 00:07:04,329
You hardly get customers like that.

87
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:06,899
It was a friend.

88
00:07:07,329 --> 00:07:09,930
What friend?
Did he come to our wedding?

89
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:13,339
No, he's an old friend
from middle school.

90
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,670
We just met by coincidence.

91
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:20,379
Really? But you said you didn't
have any friends from school.

92
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:24,250
Yes, but it was nice to see him
after all this time.

93
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:25,920
I told you.

94
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,720
That's why I told you to attend
your school reunions and stuff.

95
00:07:30,019 --> 00:07:32,160
I came here to wipe your furniture.

96
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:36,360
I'm hungry.
Let's have breakfast first, okay?

97
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,079
Why are you looking at me like that?

98
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:59,579
Do my looks still dazzle you
that much?

99
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,959
Isn't the weather lovely today?

100
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:08,029
Gosh, you're so good
at changing the subject.

101
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,329
You've changed so much.
You used to turn red and go silent.

102
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:50,740
Ma'am, I'm here.

103
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,740
Ma'am?

104
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,940
She didn't even lock the door.

105
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:50,289
What is this mess?

106
00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:57,129
And why are her thumbnails missing?

107
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,139
This is so horrible.

108
00:10:01,669 --> 00:10:03,840
- The Yeonju Serial Murder Case.
- What?

109
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,480
This, look.

110
00:10:06,809 --> 00:10:08,509
The victim's thumbnails
have all be removed.

111
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:10,750
It's exactly the same as
the Yeonju Serial Murder Case...

112
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,980
that occurred in 2002.

113
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,750
There were seven victims,

114
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,720
Their thumbnails were all missing.

115
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,720
Do you mean the case
Reporter Kim mentioned last time?

116
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,960
- Yes.
- Why don't I know about this?

117
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,360
The murderer committed suicide,
so the case was closed immediately.

118
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:27,500
Then there was the World Cup.

119
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,669
So this is a copycat murder
from 18 years ago?

120
00:10:33,139 --> 00:10:34,740
- But why?
- Well...

121
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,409
Mom!

122
00:10:37,409 --> 00:10:39,340
Mom! Let me go!

123
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,909
Let go, you scumbags!

124
00:10:40,909 --> 00:10:44,649
Who killed my mom?
Let me go!

125
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:46,750
Mom! I'm here!

126
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:50,549
Why would you die? Mom...

127
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,289
Mom!

128
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,539
(Where the Morning Star Hovers)

129
00:11:58,889 --> 00:12:00,929
Hyun Su, why are you doing this?

130
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:03,559
Why are you doing this to me?

131
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:07,029
Hey, this is a crime.

132
00:12:07,669 --> 00:12:08,669
Do you understand?

133
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:11,470
Do you remember?

134
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:14,669
18 years ago,

135
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,409
we were in each other's shoes.

136
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,340
I said, hold him!

137
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,649
- Let me go!
- Push him.

138
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,519
- Hey, hold him tight.
- I did.

139
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,019
- Let me go!
- Be still!

140
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:34,330
(Summer of 2002)

141
00:12:35,429 --> 00:12:36,460
Hyun Su.

142
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,799
Did you think
you'd get away with this?

143
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:42,669
I should've snapped
your neck instead.

144
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,100
How dare you look at me?

145
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,879
You better beat me up right
this time...

146
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,710
because next time,
I will crush your skull.

147
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,320
Be honest. You saw it, right?

148
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,850
You saw your dad commit murder,
didn't you?

149
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:06,659
Did you really not know?

150
00:13:07,929 --> 00:13:09,529
Or are you just feigning ignorance?

151
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,629
If not, then are the rumors true?

152
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:16,100
Were you in on it?

153
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,200
You're scared of me,

154
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,570
aren't you?

155
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:33,549
The village head said...

156
00:13:34,289 --> 00:13:36,519
that you're a psychopath
just like your dad.

157
00:13:36,889 --> 00:13:39,360
He said you'd turn into him
if we let you be.

158
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:42,990
What do you think about that?

159
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:46,330
Hyun Su.

160
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,730
Tell me if it hurts too much...

161
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,600
because I'll enjoy it more.

162
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,570
Mu Jin, don't forget.

163
00:13:58,409 --> 00:13:59,710
You're next.

164
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:04,980
Throw it.

165
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,850
Finally, after 18 years,

166
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,159
your turn has come.

167
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:13,620
Hyun Su.

168
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,610
Tell me...

169
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,350
if it hurts too much.

170
00:14:37,049 --> 00:14:39,850
Hey. Hyun Su.

171
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,220
Because I'll enjoy it more.

172
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:54,470
We were young.

173
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:56,769
Right?

174
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:59,399
Kids do that.

175
00:15:02,509 --> 00:15:04,039
There were others too.

176
00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:12,019
I'm just kidding.

177
00:15:13,049 --> 00:15:15,090
If I was going to kill you,

178
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,320
I would've covered the floor
with vinyl.

179
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,690
Hyun Su.

180
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:22,029
What do you want from me?

181
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,460
If it's money, you can have it all.

182
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,100
I'm...

183
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,970
really frightened and exhausted.

184
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,070
I can neither feel my arms nor legs.

185
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:44,110
Mu Jin.

186
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,049
I'm like my dad.

187
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,220
What?

188
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:54,490
Even if you try to provoke sympathy,

189
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,629
I won't feel it one bit.

190
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,500
So stop crying.

191
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,210
It only makes me want to kill you.

192
00:16:19,419 --> 00:16:20,519
That's my phone.

193
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,860
Don't make me repeat myself.

194
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:28,559
Punch in the passcode.

195
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,399
The discoloration on her back
is fuchsia-colored.

196
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:36,970
That means she was lying down
and still for 8 to 9 hours.

197
00:16:38,299 --> 00:16:39,940
There are no constriction marks.

198
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,570
That rope was just a decoration.

199
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:46,539
She was stabbed and slashed
in eight different places.

200
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,649
I believe she bled out
due to multiple stab wounds.

201
00:16:53,049 --> 00:16:54,889
There are no traces of bleeding.

202
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,789
Her ankle bone was fractured
after she died.

203
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:01,230
So the murderer broke it
after killing her?

204
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:02,830
That's correct.

205
00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:06,759
Even her thumbnails were removed
after she died.

206
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,900
Why do you think...

207
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,099
they only removed her thumbnails?

208
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,069
If it was due to leaving DNA
or other evidence,

209
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:16,539
they would've removed
all of her nails.

210
00:17:17,779 --> 00:17:20,109
This reminds me of that case
from the past.

211
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:21,609
What was it called again?

212
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:25,079
- The Yeonju Serial Murder Case?
- Yes.

213
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,250
The murderer's name was...

214
00:17:29,789 --> 00:17:30,890
Do Min Seok.

215
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:33,690
He collected his victims' nails.

216
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,529
They were his souvenirs.

217
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,730
What is this?

218
00:17:41,869 --> 00:17:43,069
This isn't blood.

219
00:17:44,539 --> 00:17:45,640
The kit, please.

220
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,740
Copycat killings?

221
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,880
(Copycat: A crime that imitates
a former killing)

222
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,150
There are no such things
in this country.

223
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,579
The method is identical to that
of the Yeonju Serial Murder Case.

224
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,650
That's just a disguise.

225
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:04,720
This was manslaughter
done by someone who knew her.

226
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:09,059
Judging by the food we found
in her stomach,

227
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:11,329
she was eating an apple
with the murderer...

228
00:18:11,529 --> 00:18:13,329
before getting killed.

229
00:18:13,329 --> 00:18:16,069
We found the peels
at the crime scene,

230
00:18:16,069 --> 00:18:18,000
but the knife
was nowhere to be seen.

231
00:18:18,369 --> 00:18:20,470
I'm certain that
it's the murder weapon.

232
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:25,140
While eating, they had an argument.

233
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,410
The murderer became enraged
and then...

234
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,480
This is it.

235
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,519
If this had been planned,
they would've brought a weapon.

236
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:32,650
Exactly.

237
00:18:33,849 --> 00:18:36,119
- Any surveillance cameras?
- There's one in front of the house,

238
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:37,190
but it's broken.

239
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,589
Did she have any financial issues?

240
00:18:38,589 --> 00:18:41,990
She had around 20,000 dollars
to receive.

241
00:18:42,089 --> 00:18:43,960
She owned a gimbap store
and lent money...

242
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,660
to the fellow workers at the market
keeping a daily ledger.

243
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,630
She was a pretty wealthy lady.

244
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:51,140
According to the social worker
who found her body first,

245
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,970
she had even donated
to the Gangsu Community Center.

246
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,170
And it was a hefty amount.

247
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,809
How much?

248
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:58,910
It's about 370,000 dollars.

249
00:18:59,779 --> 00:19:01,509
She had donated a large sum,

250
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:05,720
so the workers here
paid special attention to her.

251
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:08,619
How could this happen?

252
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:16,329
By "special attention",

253
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:17,759
what do you mean exactly?

254
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,359
It's just like what I said.

255
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,369
She was very old and lived alone.

256
00:19:24,069 --> 00:19:26,740
So we took an interest
in her well-being.

257
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:29,210
She owned a shopping quarter too.

258
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:32,210
She probably had
over a million dollars.

259
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:34,950
- What about her family?
- She has one son.

260
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:47,660
Darn it.

261
00:19:56,869 --> 00:19:58,140
Detective Cha, why are you so quiet?

262
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:02,039
Why Do Min Seok?

263
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,940
What do you mean?

264
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:09,049
Unlike the other murder cases,
Do Min Seok's was never aired on TV.

265
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:11,480
It wasn't a long-term cold case
like the Hwaseong one,

266
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,950
so it wasn't famous either.

267
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,450
But why did they pick Do Min Seok?

268
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,660
Is that important right now?

269
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:21,460
Reporter Kim Mu Jin.

270
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,630
I'm talking about
Reporter Kim's article.

271
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,470
Ms. Kang, I don't think
I can go to work today.

272
00:20:35,009 --> 00:20:38,180
What are you talking about?
You don't come to work every day.

273
00:20:39,779 --> 00:20:41,450
I'll make sure
to go to work tomorrow.

274
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:45,779
Are you joking? I hate it when you
waste time sitting at the office.

275
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,579
Just meet your deadlines.

276
00:20:50,289 --> 00:20:53,119
- Ms. Kang, I'm currently...
- I'm busy. Let's talk later.

277
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:02,400
Since it's a weekly newspaper,
your deadline must be Friday.

278
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:05,000
That means I'll have at least
three days...

279
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,140
before they report you missing.

280
00:21:06,369 --> 00:21:09,269
Hyun Su. Please listen to me.

281
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,309
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

282
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:18,180
This is the basement of
Baek Hee Seong's workshop, right?

283
00:21:19,819 --> 00:21:22,220
- Continue.
- And you work here, right?

284
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:24,190
Yes.

285
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:25,490
I was...

286
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:28,589
supposed to meet Mr. Baek Hee Seong
here yesterday.

287
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:31,829
Why? Because I was introduced
by Mr. Baek's wife.

288
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,730
Mr. Baek's wife...

289
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:38,039
is a police officer.

290
00:21:38,769 --> 00:21:40,099
On top of that,
she's in the violent crimes unit.

291
00:21:44,309 --> 00:21:45,440
Don't you get it?

292
00:21:46,309 --> 00:21:48,480
It's just a matter of time
before they find out about this.

293
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:01,789
Hey, Kim Mu Jin.

294
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:04,859
Don't you get it?

295
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:08,029
Don't you know why
you're locked up down here?

296
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:12,400
I've been wanted for 18 years.

297
00:22:13,369 --> 00:22:15,539
How do you think I was able
to avoid getting arrested?

298
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,920
Don't tell me you're...

299
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,089
Baek Hee Seong.

300
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:37,690
Are you
Detective Cha Ji Won's husband?

301
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:42,569
Why?

302
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,569
You told me yesterday...

303
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,769
that you're not related
to the village head case.

304
00:22:47,769 --> 00:22:49,440
That's what you said to me!

305
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,480
Do you want to know the truth?

306
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:56,809
If you find out,
you'll have to deal with it.

307
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,750
What?

308
00:23:02,349 --> 00:23:05,089
No. I don't think I want to know.

309
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:06,589
Mu Jin.

310
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,130
I actually know...

311
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,299
who killed the village head.

312
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,599
I really don't want to know.

313
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,109
Are you curious?

314
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:25,210
No. Don't do this, Hyun Su.

315
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,779
- It was...
- No.

316
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:33,349
I won't listen to you.

317
00:23:33,349 --> 00:23:36,549
Don't tell me.
I won't listen to you. No.

318
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:46,500
You were right.

319
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,170
I killed him.

Hyun Su.

322
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,849
You shouldn't do this.

323
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:10,650
You shouldn't do this.

324
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,960
Give that to me.

325
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,660
Hae Su.

326
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,400
You shouldn't do this, Hyun Su.

327
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:22,900
I feel quite good.

00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,009
I found it. Here.

331
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:14,450
This is a special article series
Reporter Kim Mu Jin...

332
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:17,490
is writing on Korea's
most heinous criminals.

333
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:19,559
His most recent article
was on Do Min Seok.

334
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:22,190
Are you saying the criminal
read this article...

335
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:23,859
and copied Do Min Seok?

336
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,160
Listen to this.

337
00:25:26,059 --> 00:25:29,329
"Do Min Seok's victims
all had something in common."

338
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:31,670
"They all had a noose
around their necks..."

339
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:34,240
"and had permanent injuries
on one of their ankles."

340
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,740
"The most shocking thing of all..."

341
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:39,980
"was that the thumbnails
of the victims were removed."

342
00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:43,079
What do you think?
Doesn't it sound similar?

343
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:47,519
But when you fact-check
what was in the article,

344
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:48,720
the story changes.

345
00:25:49,289 --> 00:25:52,220
Firstly, what the victims had
around their necks weren't nooses.

346
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:57,130
They were dog leashes for large dogs
made by a company called Hound Dog.

347
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:59,529
He only used ones
with a specific pattern.

348
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,900
Since the police didn't release
the brand or the pattern,

349
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,630
it's not a surprise
they didn't know.

350
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:07,500
But if this is a copycat,
they must know...

351
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,069
that Do Min Seok used a dog leash.

352
00:26:11,309 --> 00:26:14,380
In the article, he said the killer
caused permanent injuries.

353
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:18,079
In actuality, it wasn't a fracture.
He severed the Achilles tendon.

354
00:26:19,019 --> 00:26:22,650
This means the criminal doesn't know
much about Do Min Seok.

355
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,660
What if it's a disguise
and not a copycat crime?

356
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:31,430
That means Detective Choi was right.

357
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,859
This criminal
definitely has a motive.

358
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,970
That's why they wanted it
to look like there was no motive.

359
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,200
But why did it have to be
Do Min Seok?

360
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:44,309
Because this article was exposed...

361
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:47,509
to many
unspecified individuals recently.

362
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:52,079
(Kindergarten Director)

363
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,750
- Hello.
- Ms. Cha.

364
00:26:58,289 --> 00:27:00,420
There's an emergency.
You need to come in a hurry.

365
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:33,960
(Power off)

366
00:28:00,049 --> 00:28:03,849
(You have 2 missed calls.)

367
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,259
Hey. Hey, hey!

368
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:17,569
Mom. Do you have Mom's ledger?

369
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:18,970
What?

370
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,299
Hurry up. I'm in need of cash.

371
00:28:21,809 --> 00:28:24,910
I don't know. How should I know
where her ledger is?

372
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:28,410
Then who would know?
I know Mom tells you everything.

373
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,079
It's about time you wake up.

374
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:33,579
Do you know how worried
your mother was?

375
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:37,150
Hey. Don't kid around
and hand over the ledger.

376
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:39,059
It's all mine now.

377
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:42,930
Mr. An Jong Gu.
Your mother passed away today.

378
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,859
Please act like a human being.

379
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,200
What? You little...

380
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:50,029
Hey, what are you doing?

381
00:28:51,369 --> 00:28:52,670
It's broad daylight.

382
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:55,970
Gambling?

383
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:59,839
Yes. She was really worried
about her son...

384
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:01,910
because of his gambling problem.

385
00:29:04,349 --> 00:29:07,049
But what brought you here?

386
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:10,390
I'm investigating about any enemies
Ms. Jung Moon Ok might have.

387
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:11,920
I thought you might know best.

388
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:15,730
From what I hear,
this is some sort of serial murder.

389
00:29:16,329 --> 00:29:18,930
- Am I wrong?
- That's just the culprit...

390
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:20,599
playing tricks
in order to confuse us.

391
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:22,299
He was so sloppy.

392
00:29:22,769 --> 00:29:24,930
He totally slashed up her body.

393
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:26,740
Usually, amateurs tend to...

394
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:29,410
stab here and there since
they can't land a critical blow.

395
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:31,009
- Her body was totally...
- Please stop.

396
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,309
I can't take this anymore.

397
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,579
I'm sorry.

398
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:40,619
Goodness.

399
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:43,849
Oh, Detective.

400
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:47,789
I don't know if
this will be helpful,

401
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:52,000
but Ms. Jung called me last night...

402
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,559
and asked about her will.

403
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:55,930
Her will?

404
00:29:56,430 --> 00:30:00,170
She wrote up a will, and asked
how she could get it notarized.

405
00:30:02,269 --> 00:30:05,980
I told her I'd explain in person
the next day.

406
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,849
I see, a will?

407
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,599
Kids tend to get in fights
and get hurt sometimes.

408
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:31,970
Soo Young, say you're sorry
to Eun Ha.

409
00:30:32,369 --> 00:30:35,210
Eun Ha, you can say it's okay
and make up with her.

410
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:38,240
No. Soo Young won't apologize.

411
00:30:38,579 --> 00:30:39,609
Sorry?

412
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:43,809
But Soo Young hit her
and her nose is bleeding.

413
00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:47,019
Eun Ha's the one who touched
her doll first.

414
00:30:47,549 --> 00:30:49,019
I'll pay for her treatment.

415
00:30:50,089 --> 00:30:51,720
But she won't apologize.

416
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,420
I just...

417
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:58,559
wanted to hug her doll
because it was pretty.

418
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:04,299
Ma'am, let's not turn their fight
into something more serious.

419
00:31:04,769 --> 00:31:07,400
What's important is
making them reconcile.

420
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,309
Ms. Cha.

421
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:13,309
You need to fix your kid's bad habit
as a dipper when she's young.

422
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,480
Ma'am, that's a bit harsh...

423
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:18,309
There's even an old saying.

424
00:31:18,549 --> 00:31:20,650
- "He who steals a pin..."
- "Will steal an ox."

425
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,490
What did you say?

426
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:38,529
I heard what happened
from the teacher outside.

427
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:44,710
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

428
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,410
I'll scold her strictly.

429
00:31:47,609 --> 00:31:50,509
What? Oh, okay.

430
00:31:54,019 --> 00:31:55,019
Eun Ha.

431
00:31:56,619 --> 00:31:58,089
You should apologize to Soo Young.

432
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:03,490
- Hee Seong...
- Baek Eun Ha.

433
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:06,029
Go on.

434
00:32:08,299 --> 00:32:11,529
I'm sorry, it's my fault.

435
00:32:14,269 --> 00:32:16,970
Ma'am, I'm sorry.

436
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:21,480
Director, I'm sorry.

437
00:32:33,019 --> 00:32:34,660
Have you even thought of
how Eun Ha might have felt?

438
00:32:35,259 --> 00:32:37,660
How could you apologize?

439
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,200
Imagine how soft
she'll think we are.

440
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:42,130
It's a fact that Eun Ha touched
Soo Young's doll first.

441
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:44,599
Who punches a friend just because
she touched her doll?

442
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,670
Can you understand that?

443
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,009
How could we understand
what everyone thinks?

444
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:50,710
We need to resolve the problem
at hand first.

445
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,839
Resolve? Do you call this resolving?

446
00:32:53,109 --> 00:32:54,480
What about Eun Ha then?

447
00:32:54,609 --> 00:32:56,809
She hasn't said a word since then.

448
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:58,680
She respects you the most
in the world.

449
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,349
Imagine how hurt she must feel
right now.

450
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:12,759
Ji Won.

451
00:33:14,029 --> 00:33:15,259
Did I make a mistake?

452
00:33:15,569 --> 00:33:17,130
I'm just so upset.

453
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:20,069
I'm sorry for making you upset.

454
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:24,809
It's my first time being a dad too,
so it's still a bit hard.

455
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,410
Okay, then. From now on,

456
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:34,680
I will ask you first
and do anything you say.

457
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:35,819
As if.

458
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,319
Just go and cheer up Eun Ha.

459
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:40,119
Don't worry about Eun Ha.

460
00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:41,920
Leave her up to me.

461
00:33:42,589 --> 00:33:44,390
Don't smile, it's annoying.

462
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:52,069
This is Cha Ji Won
of Gangsu Police Station.

463
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,740
We have the results
from the substance on her thumbnail.

464
00:33:55,809 --> 00:33:57,339
It's lipstick.

465
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,009
Lipstick?

466
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,450
But the victim wasn't wearing
any makeup.

467
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:10,289
Why aren't you eating?

468
00:34:12,019 --> 00:34:14,360
You really like this egg tart.

469
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:17,760
The person I really like is you.

470
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:19,360
But you...

471
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:21,929
like Soo Young more than me!

472
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:24,300
No way, that's not true.

473
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,070
You sided with Soo Young!

474
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,239
I'm on your side.

475
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:33,480
That's why I made you
as the nice girl.

476
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:36,210
Your reputation has improved.

477
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,179
What is "reputation"?

478
00:34:41,449 --> 00:34:44,849
It means when something bad happens,
you won't be suspected.

479
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,789
On the other hand,
if you have a bad reputation,

480
00:34:47,789 --> 00:34:49,429
you'll be the first to be suspected.

481
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:55,099
As of today, Soo Young's family
will have a very bad reputation.

482
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,969
Whatever. I'm the only one
who apologized...

483
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:00,539
and I got a nosebleed.

484
00:35:00,969 --> 00:35:02,309
I feel upset!

485
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,840
There's no need to feel upset.

486
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:08,440
I saw Soo Young earlier
go home crying...

487
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:11,349
because she lost her doll.

488
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:13,150
Really?

489
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:33,269
It's because she places
her stuff anywhere.

490
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:37,239
You should never be like her, okay?

491
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:40,239
Okay.

492
00:35:42,309 --> 00:35:44,150
Why don't you eat now?

493
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,860
It's delicious.

494
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,260
Is it?

495
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:01,159
Then how about one more?

496
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:02,900
Yes.

497
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:07,500
Dad, I like you the most
in the world.

498
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,010
Me too.

499
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:23,250
"If I die, as long as
a memorial service is held for me,"

500
00:36:23,349 --> 00:36:27,289
"I will donate all my money
to Gangsu Community Center."

501
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,960
"Written by Jung Moon Ok."

502
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,860
Is this real?

503
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:35,630
I found it in a box
hidden deep in her closet.

504
00:36:35,969 --> 00:36:37,269
With her daily ledger as well.

505
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:40,769
Darn it! Does this make sense?

506
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,110
No...

507
00:36:43,809 --> 00:36:47,210
I'm certain that wench
made her write this.

508
00:36:47,909 --> 00:36:49,309
That darned wench...

509
00:36:49,309 --> 00:36:52,010
Last night at around 10:30pm,

510
00:36:52,179 --> 00:36:53,679
you were at Ms. Jung's home, right?

511
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,119
Someone told us
they heard you two arguing.

512
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:01,989
Are you suspecting me right now?

513
00:37:03,489 --> 00:37:04,760
When your mother...

514
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:08,030
said she'd donate all her money
to the community center,

515
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,099
I wonder how enraged
you must've felt.

516
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:18,670
Do you have proof?

517
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:24,610
Do you have proof that I killed her?

518
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:27,320
When did you leave
Ms. Jung's home last night?

519
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:31,889
What time?

520
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,090
Darn!

521
00:37:35,889 --> 00:37:37,159
Do you take me for a fool?

522
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:41,429
Listen to me. If you want to call me
here ever again,

523
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,269
bring me a warrant.

524
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:45,699
Got it?

525
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,269
My goodness.

526
00:37:51,809 --> 00:37:54,880
Ji Won, I really didn't know
you were this stubborn.

527
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:56,710
I feel exactly the same about you.

528
00:38:01,019 --> 00:38:02,619
This is Jung Moon Ok's will.

529
00:38:03,019 --> 00:38:05,960
It says she'll donate all her money
to the community center.

530
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,289
Look at the date, it's yesterday.

531
00:38:07,659 --> 00:38:10,860
You mean a will she wrote on the day
she was killed isn't important?

532
00:38:10,929 --> 00:38:13,260
Jae Seop, listen to me.

533
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,599
Why do you think it's Do Min Seok?

534
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:16,829
That's just a disguise...

535
00:38:16,829 --> 00:38:19,099
- in order to hide his real motive.
- No.

536
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,039
The culprit had to remove
her thumbnails.

537
00:38:22,039 --> 00:38:23,869
Since there was something left
beneath them.

538
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:26,039
That was the culprit's lipstick.

539
00:38:26,409 --> 00:38:28,340
DNA will be smeared
all over that lipstick.

540
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:30,179
There was lipstick
on her fingers too.

541
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,280
Why did the culprit
leave her fingers intact then?

542
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:34,679
That's because he didn't see it.

543
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,989
He couldn't see the lipstick
because the blood wasn't oxidized.

544
00:38:42,389 --> 00:38:44,929
Stuff like lipstick gets smeared
on fingers all the time.

545
00:38:44,929 --> 00:38:46,130
Just ignore it.

546
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,369
Just focus on this.

547
00:38:51,369 --> 00:38:53,739
Who will go crazy once
he reads this will?

548
00:38:53,739 --> 00:38:55,070
Isn't it obvious?

549
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:58,409
He could've just stolen some items
and make it look like a burglary.

550
00:38:58,409 --> 00:39:00,739
But why did he complicate things
and made it look like Do Min Seok?

551
00:39:00,739 --> 00:39:02,039
That darned Do Min Seok!

552
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:05,280
It's okay.

553
00:39:06,179 --> 00:39:08,250
You, come here. What do you think?

554
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:11,320
- Me?
- Yes, what's your take on this?

555
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:14,489
Do we have to focus on the lipstick
or the will in this situation?

556
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,730
Well...

557
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:19,300
I need more time
to think about this.

558
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,960
Darn you.

559
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,300
Ji Won, don't be stubborn.

560
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,730
An Jong Gu is the murderer.

561
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:27,400
We need to find evidence
as soon as possible.

562
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,539
We need to look into all
of the victim's female friends...

563
00:39:29,539 --> 00:39:31,639
and find out whom that lipstick
belongs to.

564
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:33,739
What's the matter with you?

565
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,409
Hey, this is the perfect motive
for murder!

566
00:39:36,409 --> 00:39:37,409
Stop it!

567
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:42,119
(Jung Moon Ok)

568
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,889
What is it? Tell me.

569
00:39:48,489 --> 00:39:49,630
Jae Seop.

570
00:39:49,989 --> 00:39:51,730
Look at this thumbprint.

571
00:39:52,929 --> 00:39:54,030
Could this be...

572
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:58,469
(Jung Moon Ok)

573
00:40:19,019 --> 00:40:20,920
Ms. Jung probably couldn't find
her ink pad...

574
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,429
and had to borrow
the murderer's lipstick.

575
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:27,429
The lipstick stain on the thumb
could be somewhat wiped off,

576
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:29,869
but anything
underneath the fingernail...

577
00:40:29,869 --> 00:40:31,130
can't be removed easily.

578
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:35,440
The murderer was probably
bothered by this...

579
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,369
and decided to pull out
her thumbnail.

580
00:40:37,369 --> 00:40:39,510
Then disguised this
as a copycat killer,

581
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:41,139
imitating Do Min Seok?

582
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:44,380
Whom do you think she was with
when she wrote that will?

583
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:46,679
Park Seo Young!

584
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,050
The social worker?

585
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:51,489
When she saw that I was focusing
more of those around the victim,

586
00:40:51,489 --> 00:40:52,860
she mentioned the will.

587
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,389
She made me focus on An Jong Gu.

588
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:58,389
Ms. Jung called me last night...

589
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,760
and asked about her will.

590
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,769
Once the analysis report
for the will comes out,

591
00:41:02,769 --> 00:41:04,269
let's investigate her first.

592
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:05,769
By the way,

593
00:41:08,269 --> 00:41:09,809
why do you think she killed her?

594
00:41:12,579 --> 00:41:14,480
What was her motive for murder?

595
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:26,590
What's the result?

596
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:28,690
It's lipstick.

597
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,289
Hello, Mother.

598
00:41:33,059 --> 00:41:35,059
There's something
I need to get done by today.

599
00:41:35,429 --> 00:41:36,599
I'm sorry this keeps happening.

600
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:38,670
Okay.

601
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:42,610
You're truly a big help.

602
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:46,579
Since you're taking care
of my daughter,

603
00:41:46,809 --> 00:41:48,809
I should do the same for yours.

604
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:53,320
We're not that different,
so don't feel sorry. Okay?

605
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:56,219
Oh, right. She ate some egg tarts
a while ago,

606
00:41:56,519 --> 00:41:57,989
so you don't need
to give her any more snacks.

607
00:41:57,989 --> 00:42:00,360
- I'll see you later.
- All right.

608
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:24,750
(Gyeongnam, The truck, Witness)

609
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,550
(Cheonggyecheon, Nam Soon Gil, 5pm)

610
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,489
(Cheonggyecheon, Nam Soon Gil, 5pm)

611
00:43:03,219 --> 00:43:05,590
Hyun Su, give me some water.

612
00:43:06,389 --> 00:43:09,260
I'm parched.

613
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:11,559
I think I might die. Please.

614
00:43:11,559 --> 00:43:13,030
Give me some water.

615
00:43:17,969 --> 00:43:19,099
Explain this.

616
00:43:19,969 --> 00:43:21,539
Why would you meet Nam Soon Gil?

617
00:43:23,539 --> 00:43:24,670
Oh, this?

618
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,179
It's nothing.

619
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:38,989
I remember now.

620
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:45,690
He wanted to report something,
so we had decided to meet.

621
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:47,230
Report what?

622
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:51,530
Answer me.

623
00:43:52,969 --> 00:43:54,269
Give me some water first.

624
00:43:54,969 --> 00:43:56,610
If I've thrown you a bone,

625
00:43:57,170 --> 00:43:59,610
shouldn't you do the same for me?
It's only fair, isn't it?

626
00:44:12,519 --> 00:44:14,489
Tell me. Report what?

627
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:20,829
You.

628
00:44:24,429 --> 00:44:25,900
Why did he contact you?

629
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,610
Because I wrote an article.

630
00:44:29,869 --> 00:44:30,869
About what?

631
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:35,440
It was about you and your father.

632
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:37,309
It's nothing new.

633
00:44:38,349 --> 00:44:39,619
When are you two supposed to meet?

634
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,320
Today.

635
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:52,929
Hyun Su.

636
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:55,760
If I don't show up there,

637
00:44:56,769 --> 00:44:58,369
wouldn't you be in a pickle?

638
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:24,760
Ms. Park.

639
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:28,030
I'm Detective Cha Ji Won
from Gangsu Police Station.

640
00:45:31,699 --> 00:45:33,369
Do you need more help
with something?

641
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:36,539
We found a female DNA
on Ms. Jung's will.

642
00:45:36,539 --> 00:45:38,469
We think it's the suspect's.

643
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,340
We're getting mouth swabs...

644
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:43,409
from all the females
who were around Ms. Jung.

645
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:47,449
Once we compare the DNA,
it'll be discarded immediately.

646
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:50,320
Will you cooperate?

647
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:57,289
No.

648
00:45:59,059 --> 00:46:01,260
If you refuse to cooperate,

649
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:04,030
it could work against you in court.

650
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:07,969
Do you have proof that I killed her?

651
00:46:10,269 --> 00:46:11,670
No, not yet.

652
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:17,449
There's something strange
about her clothing.

653
00:46:18,409 --> 00:46:20,650
- Can we see her leaving?
- Sure.

654
00:46:29,289 --> 00:46:30,360
She's wearing different clothes.

655
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,900
No, she just wore it inside out.

656
00:46:39,469 --> 00:46:40,539
You're right.

657
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:43,039
It's because there was blood on it.

658
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:48,079
This means she went back home
right after committing the murder.

659
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:49,380
That means...

660
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:54,679
the murder weapon
and the thumbnails are in there.

661
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,980
(Nam Soon Gil)

662
00:47:23,309 --> 00:47:25,809
(Reporter Kim Mu Jin)

663
00:47:26,849 --> 00:47:29,789
Hello, sir. Are you here?

664
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:33,260
I'm currently working on
another case,

665
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:35,360
so I'm afraid I can't go. I'm sorry.

666
00:47:37,489 --> 00:47:40,260
I see. It can't be helped then.

667
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,699
May I interview you
on the phone right now?

668
00:47:44,599 --> 00:47:46,440
Sure, that's fine.

669
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:51,639
What did you want to report
about Do Hyun Su?

670
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:52,869
One minute, please.

671
00:47:55,579 --> 00:47:56,909
("Yeonju Serial Murder Case's
Do Min Seok and His Son")

672
00:47:56,909 --> 00:48:00,079
I heard Hyun Su disappeared
from the village last summer.

673
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:03,090
From the fall of 2000
to the summer of 2005,

674
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:05,920
I've stayed with him.
We did delivery together.

675
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:07,960
And?

676
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:10,789
Hyun Su didn't have an ID card,

677
00:48:10,789 --> 00:48:12,429
so I thought he had his reasons.

678
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:15,199
I never imagined he'd be a murderer.

679
00:48:15,199 --> 00:48:16,500
If I knew, I would've reported him.

680
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:21,400
I didn't know
he was a serial killer's son either.

681
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:24,340
I can't believe
he's Do Min Seok's son.

682
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:25,639
No wonder.

683
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:27,010
"No wonder"?

684
00:48:27,739 --> 00:48:30,480
He was a little strange.
He wasn't normal.

685
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:33,380
We watched a movie together once,

686
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,750
and he asked me exactly where
he should be laughing...

687
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:37,889
or feeling sad after it was over.

688
00:48:37,889 --> 00:48:40,190
So you knew Do Hyun Su
for three years.

689
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:43,090
Is that all?

690
00:48:43,929 --> 00:48:44,989
Pardon?

691
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:48,429
All right.
Thank you for your report.

692
00:48:48,429 --> 00:48:49,559
I'll hang up now.

693
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:51,699
No, Reporter Kim. Don't hang up.

694
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:54,699
I'm...

695
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:57,809
being threatened by Do Hyun Su.

696
00:49:00,110 --> 00:49:01,139
What?

697
00:49:01,309 --> 00:49:03,380
I'm about to go crazy because of it.

698
00:49:03,949 --> 00:49:05,550
Please protect me.

699
00:49:12,489 --> 00:49:13,489
No?

700
00:49:13,489 --> 00:49:15,489
No. She wasn't seen
leaving the house...

701
00:49:15,789 --> 00:49:17,659
after coming back home.

702
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:19,699
Shouldn't we search the place
right now...

703
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,159
before all evidence disappears?

704
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:24,130
She knows
there are security cameras.

705
00:49:24,429 --> 00:49:26,900
She wouldn't leave any evidence
in the house knowing that.

706
00:49:27,969 --> 00:49:30,969
I bet she left home.

707
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:36,480
I saw a shooting star last night.

708
00:49:39,679 --> 00:49:41,820
I think she came to say bye to me.

709
00:50:52,019 --> 00:50:54,860
Please make way and stop
obstructing my business.

710
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,360
I'm quite surprised...

711
00:50:58,690 --> 00:51:00,230
that you're not shaken at all.

712
00:51:00,659 --> 00:51:02,159
That's because I'm innocent.

713
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:09,909
Yes?

714
00:51:11,869 --> 00:51:12,969
It's me.

715
00:51:14,409 --> 00:51:17,380
- I found it.
- Okay.

716
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:20,219
Ms. Park Seo Young.

717
00:51:20,579 --> 00:51:23,389
You're now a suspect of
a murder case starting this second.

718
00:51:24,090 --> 00:51:25,789
I'll make an emergency arrest
without a warrant...

719
00:51:25,789 --> 00:51:27,519
on charges
of murdering Ms. Jung Moon Ok.

720
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:29,690
Can I put some makeup on first?

721
00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:34,400
- What?
- I usually don't look like this.

722
00:51:34,699 --> 00:51:36,929
I didn't wear makeup today
to look sad.

723
00:51:38,969 --> 00:51:40,400
I read in a book...

724
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,570
that your appearance
can influence the sentence.

725
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:48,710
Go ahead.

726
00:51:55,179 --> 00:51:56,920
Why did you kill Ms. Jung Moon Ok?

727
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:05,059
Because there were too many stairs.

728
00:52:30,619 --> 00:52:33,719
(Jung Moon Ok)

729
00:52:44,199 --> 00:52:46,699
I hate complicated things.

730
00:52:47,239 --> 00:52:49,340
Can you look into
notarizing it and hiring a lawyer?

731
00:52:49,909 --> 00:52:52,539
Please just take care of it for me.

732
00:52:53,809 --> 00:52:54,809
Okay.

733
00:52:56,239 --> 00:52:57,909
I have no regrets now.

734
00:52:58,949 --> 00:53:01,050
All I need...

735
00:53:01,449 --> 00:53:05,219
is for you to come here every day
and talk to me...

736
00:53:05,219 --> 00:53:07,760
like my daughter or granddaughter.
I don't need anything else.

737
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:12,030
"Every day"?

738
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:13,630
Gosh.

739
00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:17,500
Se Young, can you scratch my back?

740
00:53:18,329 --> 00:53:20,840
It really hits the spot
when you scratch it for me.

741
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,340
A sponsor who gives us large sums
are like kings...

742
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:30,650
at our community welfare center.

743
00:53:31,179 --> 00:53:33,250
I imagined climbing up
those stairs every day...

744
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:36,050
until that old woman died,

745
00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:38,090
and it made my blood boil.

746
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,889
I'm always thankful to you,
Seo Young.

747
00:53:43,889 --> 00:53:44,889
It's nothing.

748
00:53:54,969 --> 00:53:56,199
This is the police.

749
00:53:57,710 --> 00:53:59,610
Someone died!

750
00:54:00,239 --> 00:54:03,210
Please help! Please help!

751
00:54:07,449 --> 00:54:08,519
Gosh.

752
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:11,449
Why are you looking at me
like I'm a bug?

753
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:14,190
You're hurting my feelings.

754
00:54:16,489 --> 00:54:19,860
How could you kill someone
for such a petty reason?

755
00:54:21,659 --> 00:54:24,099
About three percent of people
are like me.

756
00:54:28,469 --> 00:54:29,570
Who knows?

757
00:54:30,139 --> 00:54:31,809
Someone close to you
might be the same.

758
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:37,949
I've been getting calls...

759
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,820
from a payphone every day
at 4am for the last month.

760
00:54:42,179 --> 00:54:45,650
Did that blackmailer say
they're Do Hyun Su?

761
00:54:46,219 --> 00:54:47,320
Who is this?

762
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:51,530
I said, who is this?

763
00:54:53,059 --> 00:54:54,159
Are you happy?

764
00:54:57,530 --> 00:54:58,599
Is this Do Hyun Su?

765
00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:03,369
I've been waiting for you
to be living your happiest moments.

766
00:55:03,739 --> 00:55:04,739
You...

767
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:07,409
It's you, right, Hyun Su?

768
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:10,409
Now I'll do what I can do.

769
00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:13,010
There's only Hyun Su
who'd do such a thing to me.

770
00:55:14,349 --> 00:55:15,380
Why is that?

771
00:55:19,289 --> 00:55:22,690
I was young and blinded by money.

772
00:55:23,789 --> 00:55:25,690
I did something I shouldn't have
to Hyun Su.

773
00:55:28,929 --> 00:55:30,500
Are you sure you lost it here?

774
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,070
Yes, I'm sure.

775
00:55:33,769 --> 00:55:36,340
I had my wallet when I was going up.

776
00:55:41,909 --> 00:55:43,380
It's not here.
It's impossible to find.

777
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:46,010
If you need it urgently,
I'll lend you the money.

778
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:47,150
Let's go down now.

779
00:56:11,369 --> 00:56:12,510
What are you doing?

780
00:56:14,639 --> 00:56:15,880
I need your money.

781
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,679
I want to live properly for once.

782
00:56:23,019 --> 00:56:25,050
I'm sure Hyun Su will avenge me.

783
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:28,460
You should suspect someone else.

784
00:56:29,289 --> 00:56:31,829
Do Hyun Su died.

785
00:56:33,159 --> 00:56:35,130
Really?

786
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:38,300
Yes. So you can...

787
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:41,500
forget about him completely.

788
00:56:45,170 --> 00:56:47,780
I'm glad. I'm so glad.

789
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:51,179
"Glad"?

790
00:56:52,579 --> 00:56:55,219
He's on the run
after murdering people anyway.

791
00:56:55,719 --> 00:56:56,920
What's the point of him living?

792
00:56:57,349 --> 00:56:59,750
Some people are better off dead.
Don't you agree, Reporter Kim?

793
00:57:00,789 --> 00:57:01,920
That's true.

794
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:06,659
Some are better off dead.

795
00:57:29,449 --> 00:57:30,519
Too bad.

796
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:33,050
I really don't like
those eyes of yours.

797
00:57:38,690 --> 00:57:39,690
I give up.

798
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:41,900
Please arrest me.

799
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:04,050
It's okay. It's nothing.

800
00:58:13,429 --> 00:58:14,730
Can a policewoman do this?

801
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:18,070
Who will believe a woman
who killed someone...

802
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:19,329
just because
she didn't want to climb stairs?

803
00:58:20,199 --> 00:58:21,500
What will you do?

804
00:58:21,769 --> 00:58:24,739
A police could kill a culprit
during a physical struggle.

805
00:58:24,739 --> 00:58:25,909
Don't you agree?

806
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:27,239
Are you crazy?

807
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:30,409
Do you think you're some
superior being...

808
00:58:30,409 --> 00:58:32,780
just because you can deceive
and hurt people weaker than you?

809
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:35,420
I turned myself in.
I'm going to report this!

810
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:38,690
I'm about to watch
with my very own eyes...

811
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:41,690
how pitifully you looked
right before you died.

812
00:58:46,289 --> 00:58:47,760
Carotid, 12 seconds.

813
00:58:48,530 --> 00:58:50,329
Subscapular artery, 3.5 seconds.

816
00:59:01,639 --> 00:59:02,809
I'm sorry.

817
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:09,880
Please don't kill me.

818
00:59:13,889 --> 00:59:15,119
Please don't kill me.

819
00:59:20,030 --> 00:59:23,300
I was just joking. How could
a police just kill someone?

820
00:59:24,070 --> 00:59:26,000
I informed you
of your crime earlier,

821
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,969
and since you're human too,

822
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:31,739
you have the right to an attorney
and the right to make excuses.

823
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:35,380
You also have the right to file
a complaint about a wrongful arrest.

824
00:59:38,110 --> 00:59:39,780
Don't forget your meals

- Okay, thank you.
- Okay.

Gosh, it's your son.

827
00:59:44,889 --> 00:59:48,320
Son, what brings you here?
You didn't even call.

828
00:59:48,889 --> 00:59:51,289
No special reason.
I just missed you.

829
00:59:52,329 --> 00:59:53,389
My gosh.

830
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:55,659
I regret not having a son like him.
See you.

831
00:59:56,099 --> 00:59:58,500
- Take care.
- Goodbye.

That woman may seem very bright,

833
01:00:05,369 --> 01:00:06,769
but she takes medication
for depression.

834

Is it okay to talk about
someone's illness that easily?

835
01:00:13,650 --> 01:00:15,420
I like seeing people suffer.

836
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:19,420
If I can't become like them,

837
01:00:20,219 --> 01:00:22,460
I hope they become like me.

838
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:26,260
What do you want?

839
01:00:27,730 --> 01:00:29,329
I doubt you were just passing by.

840
01:00:30,630 --> 01:00:32,800
Give me some sleeping pills.

841
01:00:41,139 --> 01:00:42,239
Honey.

842
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:50,119
What's wrong with your face?

843
01:00:50,389 --> 01:00:52,889
I was reading some documents,
and it's just a papercut.

844
01:00:53,590 --> 01:00:55,420
I love it when it rains.

845
01:00:56,019 --> 01:00:57,230
You seem excited.

846
01:00:57,690 --> 01:00:59,289
Is it okay for a detective
to like the rain?

847
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:00,659
The rain can wash away any evidence.

848
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:02,699
Why? It's romantic.

849
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:04,800
I'm craving something tasty.

850
01:01:05,530 --> 01:01:07,199
Really? What do you want to eat?

851
01:01:08,269 --> 01:01:09,269
Korean pancakes?

852
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:12,239
Korean pancakes are perfect
on a rainy day.

a 70-year-old woman...

855
01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:19,480
living alone in Gangsu-gu
has been arrested.

856
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:21,449
The culprit copied the method of
Do Min Seok,

857
01:01:21,449 --> 01:01:23,380
who was behind the
Yeonju serial murders...

858
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:25,050
in order to avoid being caught.

859
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:28,960
However, the police determined
the crime was sloppy and impulsive,

860
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:32,829
and focused on securing evidence
in order to make a quick arrest.

861
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:35,900
The murderer turned out to be
a social worker who worked...

862
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,530
in a community center
for the elderly,

863
