(Missing: Jung Mi Sook)

9
00:00:45,619 --> 00:00:47,719
This wouldn't have happened...

10
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,719
if you didn't allow any witnesses.

11
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:55,359
It was my mistake.

12
00:00:57,229 --> 00:00:59,259
So what do you want me to do?

13
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,100
The one who made the mistake
should take responsibility.

14
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,739
That's our rule.

15
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:16,579
What do I have to do?

16
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:22,219
There's a cliff
all the way over there.

17
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:26,019
Take care of her there.

18
00:01:27,859 --> 00:01:29,030
After that, you should confess.

19
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:34,269
She fell off the cliff and died
while running away.

20
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,700
You'll get out soon as long as
you find a good lawyer.

21
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,340
There's no need to think about it.

22
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:54,890
Let's make Do Hyun Su do it.

23
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:57,590
What?

24
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,260
You said he does anything
you ask him to do.

25
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,539
If I wanted,

26
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,240
I could've killed you just now.

27
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:24,419
Don't ever bring up
Hyun Su's name again.

28
00:02:25,949 --> 00:02:26,990
Got that?

29
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:34,360
All you have to do is just
follow me blindly.

30
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,430
If you do, you'll be entertained...

31
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,530
for a long time.

32
00:02:43,699 --> 00:02:44,840
Do you understand?

33
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,979
Now do your job.

34
00:03:34,189 --> 00:03:36,849
It sounds like the criminal
is someone you know, Ms. Gong Mi Ja.

35
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:39,819
Is there anyone you suspect?

36
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,930
Ms. Gong Mi Ja?

37
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,770
Yes. There is.

38
00:03:56,909 --> 00:03:58,210
There's one person.

39
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,050
And who would that be?

40
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,680
Do Hyun Su.

41
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:10,389
"Do Hyun Su"?

42
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,699
Ms. Gong Mi Ja?

43
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,370
We really...

44
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:29,269
started what we did
with good intentions.

45
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,779
We felt sorry for him because
he lived as a wanderer.

46
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,480
It felt like
we regained our lost son.

47
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,720
At the time, my husband and I...

48
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:43,050
needed something
to devote our affection.

49
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,100
For 15 years,

50
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,100
Do Hyun Su...

51
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,500
lived as my son.

52
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:01,910
As Baek Hee Seong.

53
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,149
Starting from now,

54
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:16,189
I won't trust anyone.

55
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,920
What are you trying to do?

56
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:24,129
I want you
to lift your hands up slowly.

57
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,569
You understand what I mean, right?

58
00:05:29,269 --> 00:05:30,740
Honey, don't do this.

59
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,339
You can't get anything
out of doing this.

60
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:40,339
Do you think you can...

61
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,319
convince me in this situation?

62
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:00,329
Walk towards the monitor.

63
00:06:10,209 --> 00:06:12,509
Unplug all the cables.

64
00:06:13,009 --> 00:06:14,110
All four.

65
00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:48,709
Give me three days.

66
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,250
No, just one.

67
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:52,180
I promise I'll return.

68
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,790
How could you put a knife
on my neck?

69
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,420
I'm going to run away right now.

70
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,589
It was the most effective way
to avoid making you an accomplice.

71
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,199
How could you put a knife
on my neck?

72
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:26,250
It's just silver
that wasn't sharpened.

73
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:29,189
It's just an ornament
you can open envelopes with.

74
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,019
How should I know
if it was sharpened or not?

75
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,459
What's important is that you just
threatened my life.

76
00:07:39,529 --> 00:07:40,629
Sure.

77
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,639
We've only known each other
for 14 years.

78
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:49,509
Of course, you have
no idea what I'd do.

79
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,310
If you're Cha Ji Won,

80
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:58,120
I thought you'd be fast
to catch on to my intentions.

81
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:02,120
Are you mad at me?

82
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,589
I have no right to be mad at you.

83
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,990
I'm a fool who leaves behind
fingerprints...

84
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:09,160
at a murder scene
my wife is investigating!

85
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:12,360
This is no time to be emotional.

86
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,029
Me?

87
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,740
Did you just say I'm emotional?

88
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,310
No.

89
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,850
I'm insanely rational right now.

90
00:08:50,169 --> 00:08:51,269
I'm sorry.

91
00:08:57,409 --> 00:08:59,039
Jung Mi Sook is alive.

92
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:02,980
What?

93
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:05,820
Yeom Sang Chul has
Jung Mi Sook with him.

94
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:09,919
What are you suddenly talking about?

95
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:13,590
The police are on their way.
There's no time.

96
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:15,389
I can't explain in detail.

97
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:18,659
Ji Won.

98
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,899
I'll catch the real criminal
with my own hands...

99
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:24,970
and return on my own two feet.

100
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,039
I can't let you go.

101
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:56,000
The CCTV camera.

102
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,940
Check the CCTV footage.

103
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:27,429
Play that again.

104
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:32,669
Enlarge the first cam.

105
00:10:34,909 --> 00:10:36,039
Stop.

106
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:42,480
The closet.

107
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,679
What about it?

108
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:56,090
He couldn't have gotten far.

109
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,259
- Make an emergency report.
- Yes, sir.

110
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,559
This is an emergency.
67, Sansu-ro, Mapo-gu.

111
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:01,700
A suspected serial killer
has taken his wife hostage...

112
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,700
and is on the run.

113
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:05,139
The suspect is a male in his 30s.
The hostage is a female in her 30s.

114
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:10,940
Please. It's not too late.

115
00:11:11,909 --> 00:11:13,009
Let's go.

116
00:11:13,179 --> 00:11:15,679
If I get caught right now,
Jung Mi Sook will die.

117
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,519
(Where the Morning Star Hovers)

118
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,049
First, we need to know
where they're going.

119
00:11:21,049 --> 00:11:23,289
- Go to the control center.
- Yes, sir.

120
00:11:23,289 --> 00:11:26,019
Please cordon the house
until our men come.

121
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,090
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

122
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,440
What do you mean?

123
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,139
You said she's alive.

124
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:41,639
And now, you're saying she'll die.

125
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,940
Uncuff me first.

126
00:11:47,909 --> 00:11:49,080
Explain this to me first.

127
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,179
Give me one day.

128
00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:55,220
I'll come back no matter what.
You have my word.

129
00:11:55,389 --> 00:11:57,350
What will you do
in just a single day?

130
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,190
I'm going to make things right...

131
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:02,759
for me, Jung Mi Sook,

132
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,200
and the killer.

133
00:12:06,429 --> 00:12:07,570
I'm going to fix everything.

134
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:16,509
Ji Won, please trust me.

135
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:23,909
I'm coming with you.

136
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,620
What?

137
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,350
I'll trust you.

138
00:12:34,059 --> 00:12:35,159
Like this?

139
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:37,559
This is the most I can do.

140
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:54,039
Fine. Let's go.

141
00:13:10,129 --> 00:13:12,500
- Wait.
- What is it?

142
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:14,700
Pack some cash.

143
00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:51,840
Wait.

144
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,039
Why was there a hidden space
in the closet?

145
00:13:57,509 --> 00:13:58,539
Tell me.

146
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,679
What else do I not know?

147
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:04,549
Uncuff me first.

148
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:06,279
It's getting in the way.

149
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:10,350
If I uncuff you,
you'll run away without me.

150
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,490
Do you really not trust me?

151
00:14:13,789 --> 00:14:17,090
It's not that.
I just know you too well.

152
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,870
Then at least take this off,
will you?

153
00:14:32,179 --> 00:14:33,240
(Public Official, Cha Ji Won)

154
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:37,720
(Public Official, Cha Ji Won)

155
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,049
Does this make any sense?

156
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:44,259
You guys were reinvestigating
the Yeonju Serial Murder Case.

157
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,919
And yet, you didn't even know
that Do Hyun Su...

158
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:48,259
was right before your eyes?

159
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:50,090
How could you
call yourselves the police?

160
00:14:50,929 --> 00:14:52,659
I'm completely mortified!

161
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,129
The Cold Case Team couldn't find him
for the past 20 years,

162
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:57,769
so how could we have found him?

163
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,700
We're the police, not shamans.

164
00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:04,110
He lived 15 years as someone else.

165
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,440
Still!

166
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:08,450
Detective Cha is in danger.

00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:12,149
We need to focus on rescuing her.

168
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:14,019
Are you sure...

169
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:16,820
she didn't know about this
all this time?

170
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,389
Is that even a question?

171
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,590
She's currently a hostage.

172
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:25,500
After she had found out about him,
he went totally ballistic.

173
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:29,299
Lee Woo Chul, your entire team
is going to pay for this.

174
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,440
Yes, sir.

175
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:37,409
Catch Do Hyun Su at all costs.

176
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:42,080
Hello? Don't even ask.
It's a complete mess.

177
00:15:47,149 --> 00:15:48,220
Woo Chul.

178
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:54,860
Detective Cha has nothing
to do with this, right?

179
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,230
When Do Hyun Su had tipped us off
about Yeom Sang Chul,

180
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:01,830
she had no idea, right?

181
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,240
Choi Jae Seop, let go of her.

182
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,769
What are you doing?

183
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,110
You knew,

184
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:11,379
and you controlled us...

185
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,480
the way you wanted all this time.

186
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,049
You...

187
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,679
deceived us.

188
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,720
Yes, sir. I can guarantee you that.

189
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,720
She knew nothing.

190
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:31,200
First, we need to find out
Do Hyun Su's whereabouts.

191
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,700
Group 1 and 2, check the CCTVs,
dashcams,

192
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,700
and if there were any witnesses.

193
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:36,830
Find out his whereabouts.

194
00:16:37,169 --> 00:16:39,440
Group 3, keep your eyes
on his call logs,

195
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,940
transaction records,
and hospital visits.

196
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,940
Groups 4 and 5,
visit his acquaintances.

197
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:48,409
You mustn't forget
that our colleague is a hostage.

198
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:50,679
First and foremost,

199
00:16:51,549 --> 00:16:53,750
her safety is the most important.
Got it?

200
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:54,820
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

201
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,919
Go on.

202
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,450
Your palms are going to get
heat rashes.

203
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,920
Sorry?

204
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:38,630
My girlfriend can't stand
being apart from me even for a bit.

205
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:43,069
I feel extremely anxious
when we're apart.

206
00:17:43,069 --> 00:17:45,940
Honey, let's keep
such private information...

207
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:48,009
to ourselves.

208
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:00,380
No.

209
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,849
Why are you doing this? No.

210
00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:04,890
- Be quiet.
- Why are you doing this?

211
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:06,859
- Please don't!
- Be quiet!

212
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,660
Please spare me.

213
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:20,640
Be honest with me, okay?

214
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,210
Okay.

215
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,309
What did you and Do Hyun Su...

216
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,579
What did you talk about
with that guy on the phone?

217
00:18:30,049 --> 00:18:31,109
What?

218
00:18:32,349 --> 00:18:35,589
He asked me who I was.

219
00:18:35,589 --> 00:18:36,720
And?

220
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,630
I said I was Jung Mi Sook.
That's all.

221
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:49,970
Did I do something wrong?

222
00:18:52,269 --> 00:18:53,799
Did you tell him where we were?

223
00:18:55,109 --> 00:18:56,569
No, I didn't.

224
00:18:57,410 --> 00:19:00,109
I don't even know where I am.

225
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,380
I've been here before.

226
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,529
Do you remember this place?

227
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:25,900
Those people.

228
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:31,299
They...

229
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,099
They locked me up in here.

230
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:37,910
Let me out.

231
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,839
Let me out of here.

232
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:43,349
Mister, please take me out.

233
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:45,779
Please let me out of here.

234
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:53,490
It was a lie when you said...

235
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:57,230
you'd find my family, right?

236
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:05,400
No, don't go!

237
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,170
No! Please!

238
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:09,309
Please don't go!

239
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,380
You did a great job, Mom.

240
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,190
What...

241
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:27,160
will happen to us?

242
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:30,690
Whether it's a car accident
or manslaughter,

243
00:21:31,529 --> 00:21:33,529
the statute of limitations
has expired already.

244
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,299
I'll just...

245
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:39,099
wake up like a miracle...

246
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:42,839
when the world quiets down.

247
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:48,410
Do you think...

248
00:21:49,779 --> 00:21:53,220
things will go as planned?

249
00:21:55,049 --> 00:21:56,289
I guarantee it.

250
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:00,490
No matter how much Do Hyun Su
pleads his innocence,

251
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,059
it's a fact that he's being
wanted for murder.

252
00:22:03,589 --> 00:22:05,700
He also stole
someone else's identity.

253
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:08,029
Do Hyun Su is already guilty.

254
00:22:09,869 --> 00:22:11,029
Are you sure...

255
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:14,869
this is really the end?

256
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,839
You just have to receive
police investigation sincerely.

257
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:24,880
Just like we practiced, sincerely.

258
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:38,559
Who is it?

259
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,099
(Incoming call)

260
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:46,470
The scraps left over
after the main course.

261
00:22:54,809 --> 00:22:56,680
I thought our business was over.

262
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:58,920
We're not finished yet.

263
00:22:59,619 --> 00:23:01,619
I already took care of Do Hyun Su.

264
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:04,089
How much will you pay me
for Jung Mi Sook?

265
00:23:05,289 --> 00:23:06,490
Jung Mi Sook?

266
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:08,960
Jung Mi Sook is with me.

267
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:13,759
Yes, I'm on my way now.

268
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:17,099
By the way, how did...

269
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,670
that person look?

270
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:34,619
You're right.

271
00:23:36,089 --> 00:23:39,890
We have Jung Mi Sook.

272
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,700
Bring 500,000 dollars
in cash by midnight.

273
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,640
Is it an exchange?

274
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:54,369
Call me when the cash is ready.

275
00:23:56,410 --> 00:24:00,079
Yes, I'll try my best to prepare it.

276
00:24:13,089 --> 00:24:14,420
This way, please.

277
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,029
Hey, you're here.

278
00:24:36,109 --> 00:24:38,619
There's an employee who always
monitors the CCTVs.

279
00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:40,450
Just act naturally.

280
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,789
The entrance, counter,
elevator, and hallway.

281
00:24:43,789 --> 00:24:45,059
Do you know you kept
glancing around...

282
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:47,220
when we were caught on camera
four times?

283
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:50,089
As if you were being chased
by someone.

284
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:51,490
What about you?

285
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,500
You seem like someone...

286
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,400
who's practiced
this situation several times.

287
00:24:58,099 --> 00:24:59,240
What is it?

288
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,869
It's here.

289
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:27,599
It's not the time to worry
about being uncomfortable.

290
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,640
A serial murderer may be lurking
around your rooftop.

291
00:25:32,569 --> 00:25:35,369
I know it's uncomfortable,
but just hang in there, okay?

292
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,309
Come in.

293
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:45,779
You can use this room.

294
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,089
I'll change the bedsheet
and blanket for you.

295
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:51,990
No, I'm fine with the couch.
I can sleep there.

296
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:54,059
You can lock the room
when you sleep.

297
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:55,660
I know I make you uncomfortable.

298
00:25:56,589 --> 00:25:58,400
I can read it all over your face.

299
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,160
I'm making you
so uncomfortable right now.

300
00:26:01,029 --> 00:26:02,329
It's not that.

301
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:05,400
I can't do this to you.

302
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:11,339
Can't do what?

303
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,349
I hurt you all the time...

304
00:26:15,579 --> 00:26:18,750
and use you whenever I want.
That's what I'm doing...

305
00:26:18,819 --> 00:26:19,980
right now.

306
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:26,160
Why is my life such a burden
to others?

307
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,460
Hey.

308
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:33,200
You're not a burden to me.

309
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:38,769
Hold on.

310
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,670
Yes, ma'am.

311
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:44,980
Did you know or not?

312
00:26:46,579 --> 00:26:48,410
- What do you mean?
- About Do Hyun Su.

313
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,650
Did you really not know?

314
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:56,549
I'm in front of the workshop
of the murderer Do Hyun Su.

315
00:26:57,019 --> 00:26:58,089
Baek, who has been confirmed as...

316
00:26:58,089 --> 00:27:00,220
the culprit of
the Makmun-dong murder case,

317
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:02,289
has turned out to be Do Hyun Su,

318
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:03,589
who has been wanted for 18 years
as the culprit of...

319
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:05,930
the Gagyeong-ri Village
Foreman Murder Case in 2002.

320
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:09,400
Do Hyun Su has apparently lived as
Baek since 2005,

321
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,799
by stealing his identity.

322
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:15,339
Do Hyun Su also married a detective
known as Cha,

323
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:18,910
and planned thoroughly in order to
change his identity.

324
00:27:19,539 --> 00:27:21,440
The police said they're
currently investigating...

325
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,809
how he managed to steal
Baek's identity.

326
00:27:25,049 --> 00:27:27,880
Do Hyun Su's fake life
he led for 18 years...

327
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,289
has ironically come to an end
due to another murder case.

328
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:34,359
After Do Hyun Su's crime
was revealed,

329
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:37,089
he is currently on the run
while holding his wife hostage.

330
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,839
Tell me what your plan is.

331
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,410
What kind of criminal
who's on the run...

332
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:54,740
tells a detective his plan
so easily?

333
00:27:58,109 --> 00:27:59,250
What?

334
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:05,089
I've realized that whatever I say...

335
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:08,859
is totally meaningless
if that person is suspecting me.

336
00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:21,470
I'm sorry this situation
became so messed up...

337
00:28:24,509 --> 00:28:27,240
No, I'm not sorry.

338
00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:29,579
I'm not sorry at all.

339
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:34,180
I don't even know why I have to
suffer like this.

340
00:28:37,019 --> 00:28:39,220
Why do you keep getting angry at me?

341
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,559
Do you know how I feel right now?

342
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:46,700
How do you think I felt
when I found your fingerprint...

343
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,569
on the tape used to tie up
the victim?

344
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:52,269
My fingerprints
aren't on the database.

345
00:28:58,039 --> 00:28:59,809
I suspected you.

346
00:29:01,509 --> 00:29:02,910
That's why I checked.

347
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,980
Is that wrong?

348
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,259
Anyone would've done that
if they were in my shoes.

349
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:18,259
You're not anyone...

350
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,529
to me, at least.

351
00:29:32,309 --> 00:29:34,009
I was really fine.

352
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:38,009
When people hated me for no reason,

353
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,779
and even when they found me
suspicious without a reason,

354
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,549
I was really fine.

355
00:29:43,619 --> 00:29:44,750
But...

356
00:29:47,789 --> 00:29:48,829
But...

357
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,390
when it's you...

358
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,559
When it's you,

359
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:00,039
it's so hard on me.

360
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:03,309
How can I know everything?

361
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,410
How can I trust you blindly
when I don't know anything?

362
00:30:10,049 --> 00:30:12,079
How could you want me to read...

363
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:16,190
your heart and mind so clearly?

364
00:30:18,619 --> 00:30:19,720
I'm...

365
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:23,029
not someone so capable.

366
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:29,630
I thought the station
would be the safest place,

367
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:35,839
so all I could think about
was to get you there.

368
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,140
So why are you mad at me?

369
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,980
Why?

370
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:45,819
How can I know
when you don't tell me?

371
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,220
You have to tell me for me to know.

372
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:53,289
What is this?

373
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,730
Why are we like this?

374
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,000
Ji Won.

375
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:11,240
I didn't kill Park Soon Young.

376
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,250
I...

377
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:20,420
didn't kill Park Soon Young.

378
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,779
During Park Gyung Chun's case,

379
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,279
the police came to my house.
That's when I found out.

380
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:56,150
Do you mean you didn't know
before then?

381
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:57,819
Had I known,

382
00:31:58,619 --> 00:32:02,390
I wouldn't have let such a man
use my precious son's identity.

383
00:32:04,059 --> 00:32:06,930
I had no idea things would
turn out this way.

384
00:32:07,099 --> 00:32:10,670
This is why I'm saying
our great Director Baek Man Woo...

385
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:13,869
shouldn't see any disadvantages.

386
00:32:13,869 --> 00:32:15,710
- I ask for your favor.
- Gosh.

387
00:32:17,609 --> 00:32:18,640
Assemblyman.

388
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,980
You make it sound like
I'm making a request.

389
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:26,380
Please have a drink.

390
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:36,529
Superintendent,
the reason why I asked...

391
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:39,029
to meet with you is because...

392
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:42,329
I'm very worried about
Detective Cha Ji Won.

393
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:45,700
I wonder
how the investigation is going.

394
00:32:46,569 --> 00:32:48,940
I couldn't just sit still.

395
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:52,039
(The Hanjoogan)

396
00:33:01,619 --> 00:33:02,750
Kim Mu Jin!

397
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:04,720
Are you crazy?

398
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,190
You're blinded by exclusives.

399
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,230
On top of concealing a criminal,

400
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:11,329
you received information from
a wanted murderer for your story.

401
00:33:11,529 --> 00:33:14,400
We had a common goal
to catch the accomplice...

402
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,670
of the Yeonju Serial Murder Case.

403
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:18,599
Do Hyun Su took his wife
as a hostage in order to run away.

404
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,500
Ms. Kang.

405
00:33:21,339 --> 00:33:22,940
I'm certain there's something
behind this case.

406
00:33:23,269 --> 00:33:26,609
Yesterday, Do Hyun Su got a call
so he went to Makmun-dong.

407
00:33:26,609 --> 00:33:28,109
- Their voice...
- Did you know...

408
00:33:28,109 --> 00:33:30,309
Park Soon Young's hair
was found in Do Hyun Su's trunk?

409
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,049
What?

410
00:33:32,779 --> 00:33:33,980
Wake up.

411
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:36,450
Do Hyun Su is a murderer.

412
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:38,089
Who are you trying to protect?

413
00:33:40,259 --> 00:33:42,630
The one who called me out
to Makmun-dong at night...

414
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,930
is framing me.

415
00:33:48,329 --> 00:33:51,069
It must be the accomplice
we're looking for.

416
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,940
There was a car with a dashcam
in front of the payphone.

417
00:33:58,170 --> 00:33:59,609
I spoke to the owner of that car.

418
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:03,710
The number should be on my phone.

419
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:06,779
The accomplice is meticulous.

420
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:09,519
Could they have made the mistake
of getting caught on camera?

421
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:14,820
They probably covered their face.

422
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:19,329
How are you sure
the woman who picked up...

423
00:34:19,829 --> 00:34:21,929
Yeom Sang Chul's phone
is Jung Mi Sook?

424
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,940
She told me
her name is Jung Mi Sook.

425
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:36,480
It didn't sound like a lie.

426
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:39,880
But...

427
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:43,349
I didn't have the confidence
to convince the police.

428
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:45,889
Also,

429
00:34:47,059 --> 00:34:49,690
I wasn't sure if the police
would prove my innocence.

430
00:34:51,829 --> 00:34:53,429
That's why I couldn't get caught.

431
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:59,000
Investigating me would be
the police's priority.

432
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,099
Within that time,

433
00:35:00,969 --> 00:35:03,739
Yeom Sang Chul would sell
Jung Mi Sook over to him.

434
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,239
But is there a way
if you just run away recklessly?

435
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,579
My running away...

436
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:14,550
is a sort of a message
I'm sending to Yeom Sang Chul.

437
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:16,349
"A message"?

438
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:24,360
That I'm no longer
the police's informant.

439
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:27,400
Why are you sending such a message
to Yeom Sang Chul?

440
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:29,900
Because I'll...

441
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:33,340
work with Yeom Sang Chul.

442
00:35:48,349 --> 00:35:49,590
Baek, who has been confirmed as...

443
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:51,289
the culprit of
the Makmun-dong murder case,

444
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:52,659
has turned out to be Do Hyun Su,

445
00:35:52,659 --> 00:35:55,059
who has been wanted for 18 years
as the culprit of...

446
00:35:55,059 --> 00:35:56,559
the Gagyeong-ri Village
Foreman Murder Case in 2002.

447
00:35:56,559 --> 00:35:57,730
That's 33 dollars.

448
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:59,900
Do Hyun Su has apparently lived as
Baek since 2005,

449
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:03,030
by stealing his identity.

450
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:06,699
Do Hyun Su also married a detective
known as Cha,

451
00:36:06,869 --> 00:36:10,170
and planned thoroughly in order to
change his identity.

452
00:36:10,909 --> 00:36:12,909
The police said they're
currently investigating...

453
00:36:12,909 --> 00:36:15,179
how he managed to steal
Baek's identity.

454
00:36:15,909 --> 00:36:18,050
I already took care of Do Hyun Su.

455
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:20,780
What a scary guy.

456
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:39,269
(970-5524)

457
00:36:39,369 --> 00:36:40,500
What is this?

458
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:45,369
Who is this?

459
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:46,840
I'm not sure if you know this,

460
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:49,949
but I'm in a very bad situation
right now.

461
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,409
Is that you, Do Hyun Su?

462
00:36:52,449 --> 00:36:54,320
How dare you put me in a trap?

463
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,619
Isn't life fun?

464
00:36:56,789 --> 00:37:00,219
How could a wanted man
work with the police?

465
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:01,719
Now you're in the same situation
as I am.

466
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:03,730
How did you know?

467
00:37:04,659 --> 00:37:06,460
How did you do this to me?

468
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:09,500
Don't be mistaken. It wasn't me.

469
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,630
It was all him.

470
00:37:11,869 --> 00:37:13,170
Let me meet him.

471
00:37:14,539 --> 00:37:16,070
My life philosophy...

472
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,639
is to never endorse anyone
or become a middleman.

473
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:22,610
All I need is to catch that man.

474
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:26,050
As for you, Yeom Sang Chul,
you can just make money.

475
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,449
So?

476
00:37:31,219 --> 00:37:32,489
Let's work together.

477
00:37:38,429 --> 00:37:39,530
Why should I?

478
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:45,940
Is Jung Mi Sook well?

479
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:48,639
Don't mind the goods I deal with.

480
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:54,480
No. Jung Mi Sook is still with you.

481
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:56,750
You didn't hand her over.

482
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:58,579
Right?

483
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:00,519
Why do you think that?

484
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:04,889
Because you'd be dead
if you met him.

485
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:09,489
Do you think he'll keep you alive?

486
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:13,030
If you're alive, he'd have to
be an ATM for the rest of his life.

487
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,400
I'm not someone he can
easily get rid of.

488
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:21,039
But I was able to fool you.

489
00:38:24,409 --> 00:38:26,039
While I was fooled by him.

490
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,780
You get the money, I catch him,

491
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,119
and Jung Mi Sook lives.

492
00:38:34,179 --> 00:38:35,179
What do you think?

493
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,949
I'll have to think about it.

494
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,590
He's too crazy
to make into an enemy.

495
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,500
Don't you have another
tempting deal that I'll like?

496
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:51,300
(Do not negotiate.)

497
00:38:58,809 --> 00:39:00,110
You can't negotiate this.

498
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:03,679
Hello? Hey.

499
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,420
That rude punk hung up on me.

500
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:12,559
Jerk.

501
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,690
He should be begging on his knees.

502
00:39:16,789 --> 00:39:19,159
You'll be put at a disadvantage
the longer the call gets...

503
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:20,500
since you don't have a choice.

504
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,170
We got the words we wanted.

505
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,239
Do you think he'll accept my offer?

506
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:30,440
Seeing how he wanted
to keep talking to you,

507
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,039
you've pretty much won him over.

508
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,489
Food.

509
00:39:52,699 --> 00:39:53,900
Have it if you want.

510
00:40:03,409 --> 00:40:05,170
Should I pick Do Hyun Su...

511
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:07,840
or Baek Hee Seong?

512
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:20,019
This side is Do Hyun Su.

513
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:24,630
This side is Baek Hee Seong.

514
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:31,900
Can you just kill me now...

515
00:40:34,469 --> 00:40:36,840
instead of handing me over
to that yellow-haired guy?

516
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:40,039
Yellow-haired guy?

517
00:40:43,409 --> 00:40:46,519
There's a cliff
all the way over there.

518
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,150
Take care of her there.

519
00:41:33,059 --> 00:41:34,929
He even killed his accomplice.

520
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:38,469
He came up behind him...

521
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:40,769
with a rock...

522
00:41:43,269 --> 00:41:45,269
and smashed his head.

523
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:57,050
Do Min Seok didn't commit suicide?

524
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:15,940
Don't be mistaken. It wasn't me.
It was all him.

525
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:18,769
Let me meet him.

526
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,579
My life philosophy...

527
00:42:25,849 --> 00:42:27,019
It was all him.

528
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:35,289
Hello, this is Room 908.
We're out of towels.

529
00:42:35,389 --> 00:42:36,760
Could you bring some?

530
00:42:36,829 --> 00:42:38,889
- Okay.
- Thank you.

531
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,000
Everything was recorded.

532
00:42:46,969 --> 00:42:50,539
It's only circumstantial evidence,
but it'll prove your innocence.

533
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:53,409
Now, we just need to lure him.

534
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:57,909
In order for him
to trust us blindly,

535
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:00,980
I need to maintain my position
as a hostage.

536
00:43:01,849 --> 00:43:05,289
If we tell him
that I'll be your hostage...

537
00:43:05,489 --> 00:43:07,260
until he leaves with the money,

538
00:43:08,059 --> 00:43:09,929
he won't be able to refuse
that offer.

539
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,449
I love you.

540
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:43,230
Why do you sound so sad?

541
00:43:46,099 --> 00:43:48,099
Go back to where you belong.

542
00:43:52,269 --> 00:43:53,699
Go back to your place.

543
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:58,039
What does that mean?

544
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,010
That's a good idea.

545
00:44:02,909 --> 00:44:04,780
You should keep being my hostage.

546
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:06,619
What?

547
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:13,420
How could you?

548
00:44:14,989 --> 00:44:17,289
Uncuff me! I said, uncuff me!

549
00:44:17,329 --> 00:44:20,300
I dragged you here
against your will.

550
00:44:20,429 --> 00:44:23,400
You deceived me once again.

551
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:26,400
I need to join hands
with a despicable guy like him.

552
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:29,409
I won't allow you to get involved...

553
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:31,340
no matter what.

554
00:44:32,409 --> 00:44:33,780
I don't care.

555
00:44:34,039 --> 00:44:36,809
You're going to do your best
to uncover the truth...

556
00:44:39,179 --> 00:44:40,320
as a detective.

557
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:47,590
So...

558
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:56,000
Don't even think about following me.

559
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:59,840
If you leave like this,

560
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,739
I won't ever see you again.

561
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:05,070
I won't.

562
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,949
So don't go.

563
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,119
Don't leave me here.

564
00:45:45,449 --> 00:45:46,619
I'll be back.

565
00:45:52,789 --> 00:45:54,559
We'll see each other soon,

566
00:45:55,889 --> 00:45:57,860
so don't make this seem
like our last farewell.

567
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:00,630
Wish me luck instead.

568
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:08,539
Don't get hurt.

569
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:16,269
Have you made up your mind
about who to side with?

570
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:20,309
Let's make this clear.
You're the one who's siding with me.

571
00:47:24,309 --> 00:47:25,710
Where should I go?

572
00:47:28,619 --> 00:47:30,849
Hae Su, you can't leave like this.

573
00:47:30,989 --> 00:47:32,389
You told me to stay away
from Hyun Su,

574
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:34,690
but how can I?

575
00:47:34,889 --> 00:47:37,630
All the evidence shows
that he killed Park Soon Young.

576
00:47:37,989 --> 00:47:41,659
I don't want anyone to suspect you
for taking his side.

577
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,500
It's all for you.

578
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:45,429
Hyun Su got a call
from the accomplice.

579
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:47,500
I'm positive that it's a trap.

580
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:49,869
There's no proof
that it was the accomplice.

581
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:53,409
Hyun Su just thinks
that it's the accomplice's voice.

582
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:56,480
Hyun Su had a motive for murder,
and there's even proof.

583
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,349
We're the only ones who trust him.

584
00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:00,780
There's no way to make the others
do the same.

585
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:01,880
Why do you always become...

586
00:48:04,349 --> 00:48:07,059
a coward when I need you the most?

587
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:10,329
What did you say?

588
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:36,920
Car keys.

589
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:48,599
Mr. Kim Mu Jin?

590
00:48:49,869 --> 00:48:51,030
Yes?

591
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:53,769
We've found out
that you're guilty...

592
00:48:53,769 --> 00:48:55,440
of harboring Do Hyun Su.

593
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:57,039
Please come with us to the station.

594
00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:00,980
I'm really fine.

595
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:02,409
You should still go to the hospital.

596
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:04,550
Nothing happened.

597
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:06,650
He didn't even touch a hair
on my head.

598
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:10,550
You're a victim
who had been abducted.

599
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:12,650
You should get checked up
at the hospital.

600
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:14,619
- While you're there...
- I'm not a victim.

601
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:17,090
Of course, you are.
You were tied up.

602
00:49:19,530 --> 00:49:23,269
That's confidential information
regarding this investigation,

603
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:25,329
so I can't tell you the details.

604
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:28,440
Detective Cha.

605
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:30,440
Captain.

606
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:33,909
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

607
00:49:34,309 --> 00:49:35,409
I'm fine.

608
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:38,409
Rather than that,
we need to investigate...

609
00:49:38,409 --> 00:49:39,849
Park Soon Young's case
from the beginning.

610
00:49:42,519 --> 00:49:43,690
It's the same person.

611
00:49:44,489 --> 00:49:46,389
The person who killed
Park Soon Young...

612
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:48,389
and Do Min Seok's accomplice.

613
00:50:02,039 --> 00:50:03,139
Hey, are you...

614
00:50:04,039 --> 00:50:06,309
I'm sorry for worrying you.

615
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:11,980
You get the money, I catch him,

616
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:14,380
and Jung Mi Sook lives.

617
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:16,489
What do you think?

618
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:19,320
I'll have to think about it.

619
00:50:20,219 --> 00:50:22,960
He's too crazy
to make into an enemy.

620
00:50:24,289 --> 00:50:27,730
Don't you have another
tempting deal that I'll like?

621
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,800
You can't negotiate this.

622
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:33,699
This is it.

623
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:36,269
Is the Jung Mi Sook
that's mentioned here...

624
00:50:37,539 --> 00:50:38,909
the Jung Mi Sook we know?

625
00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:41,179
It seems so,
considering the circumstances.

626
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:43,280
That also explains why...

627
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,250
Jung Mi Sook's body
hasn't been found yet.

628
00:50:47,849 --> 00:50:50,750
Let's not tell anyone
Detective Cha has returned for now.

629
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:53,190
Why?

630
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:55,389
If the press gets interested
in her,

631
00:50:55,389 --> 00:50:57,989
they might find out information
about this recording file.

632
00:50:58,130 --> 00:51:00,730
If the accomplice finds out,
our plan might fail.

633
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:05,130
Did you all forget Detective Cha
should be investigated too?

634
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:09,170
Yet you'll trust her
and do as she says?

635
00:51:10,539 --> 00:51:13,909
If we're going to fail
whether we trust her or not,

636
00:51:14,409 --> 00:51:15,480
I'd choose to trust her.

637
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:17,780
He's an accomplice of
a serial murder case.

638
00:51:18,679 --> 00:51:21,119
We must not miss the chance
to catch him.

639
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:24,519
Yes, I know.

640
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:28,260
There's no better chance
to catch him than now.

641
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:33,900
Are you sure you'll find out
who the accomplice is?

642
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:35,699
Yes, sir.

643
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,099
We can do it.

644
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:40,599
We'll find out by all means.

645
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:44,670
Captain Yoon, take Team 3
and move quietly.

646
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,480
Yes, sir.

647
00:51:53,849 --> 00:51:57,519
Why on earth are you cooperating
with Yeom Sang Chul this much?

648
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:00,519
I have to give him what he wants.

649
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:03,019
So he could leave this country.

650
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:05,929
Is that really it?

651
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:10,570
Why would there be another reason?

652
00:52:11,530 --> 00:52:14,269
This will never end
by this one time.

653
00:52:20,809 --> 00:52:22,880
(Chief Kang)

654
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:26,179
Yes, sir.

655
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:31,889
Do you mean Do Hyun Su
has been caught?

656
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,659
I see.

657
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:40,860
Detective Cha's return
should be kept confidential.

658
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,599
Please be careful.

659
00:52:44,099 --> 00:52:45,269
Yes, of course.

660
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:47,739
Thank you for calling.

661
00:52:50,809 --> 00:52:52,039
Who was that?

662
00:52:53,539 --> 00:52:56,679
Cha Ji Won was found
locked up in a motel.

663
00:52:57,349 --> 00:52:58,809
Do Hyun Su was gone.

664
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:01,980
How is she?

665
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,320
She's perfectly fine.

666
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:07,719
She wasn't hurt at all.

667
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:10,659
Also,

668
00:53:11,530 --> 00:53:13,559
she will state Do Hyun Su's
innocence...

669
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:15,900
regarding the murder
of Park Soon Young.

670
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:20,340
Why?

671
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:23,039
On what grounds?

672
00:53:24,139 --> 00:53:27,309
I don't know the specific details
of the investigation either.

673
00:53:29,679 --> 00:53:31,550
Did she find out something?

674
00:53:56,039 --> 00:53:57,170
Who are you?

675
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:03,679
Who are you?

676
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:26,369
Do Hyun Su, you're under arrest
for the murder of Park Soon Young.

677
00:54:26,739 --> 00:54:29,599
I'm glad we waited in front of
Do Hae Su's house.

678
00:54:32,710 --> 00:54:35,610
You can't let him escape!
He's the accomplice!

679
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:39,079
What? He's not Do Hyun Su?

680
00:54:44,349 --> 00:54:45,519
Hello.

681
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:55,860
Wait! If you don't have anything
to do with Do Hyun Su's escape...

682
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:58,869
Do you see the man
who's reading a book behind me?

683
00:55:12,409 --> 00:55:14,150
There seems to be
a misunderstanding.

684
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:16,420
We need to listen to the
victim's statement first.

685
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:18,750
What?

686
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:27,230
We found your phone in the workshop.

687
00:55:30,769 --> 00:55:31,829
Captain.

688
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:35,840
I know you're disappointed in me.

689
00:55:38,039 --> 00:55:39,440
I have no excuse.

690
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:42,909
It's true I deceived our team.

691
00:55:43,449 --> 00:55:45,010
I didn't have time
to be disappointed.

692
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:47,380
I was too concerned about you.

693
00:55:49,519 --> 00:55:50,690
Come this way.

694
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:52,820
Ji Won.

695
00:55:56,289 --> 00:55:58,159
Are you hurt? Are you okay?

696
00:55:58,789 --> 00:56:00,829
I'm okay. I'm fine.

697
00:56:00,829 --> 00:56:01,960
Hey, Ji Won!

698
00:56:02,659 --> 00:56:05,969
You seriously scared us to death.

699
00:56:06,329 --> 00:56:08,599
- Do you know how worried I was?
- How did you run away?

700
00:56:08,599 --> 00:56:09,599
What about Do Hyun Su?

701
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:11,610
- Where is he right now?
- Well...

702
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:17,909
Ms. Do Hae Su?

703
00:56:30,289 --> 00:56:31,789
What's the matter?

704
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,730
Why did you go to Do Hae Su's house?

705
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:38,530
To catch Do Hyun Su.

706
00:56:39,030 --> 00:56:42,269
Isn't that why you were staking out
nearby too?

707
00:56:42,269 --> 00:56:45,510
You invaded her privacy
and stalked her.

708
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:47,340
- What?
- Ask him where he was...

709
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:49,440
last night at 2:30am.

710
00:56:51,110 --> 00:56:53,309
Where were you at 2:30am last night?

711
00:56:53,409 --> 00:56:54,880
Why is that important?

712
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:59,650
Last night from 9pm to 3am,
I was with my colleagues.

713
00:56:59,889 --> 00:57:01,860
My husband received a call
from the accomplice...

714
00:57:02,389 --> 00:57:05,360
at 2:30am from a payphone
in Makmun-dong.

715
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:08,360
That's why he went to
Makmun-dong...

716
00:57:11,099 --> 00:57:13,800
- Mom!
- Eun Ha.

717
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:19,570
What are you doing here?
What about Grandma?

718
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:22,539
I'm sorry for not telling you
earlier.

719
00:57:24,010 --> 00:57:26,110
Your mother is at the hospital
right now.

720
00:57:27,179 --> 00:57:28,280
What?

721
00:57:28,849 --> 00:57:30,119
Mom.

722
00:57:31,849 --> 00:57:33,320
Where's Dad?

723
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:39,760
Where is Dad?

724
00:57:44,199 --> 00:57:45,429
Mom, are you okay?

725
00:57:47,639 --> 00:57:48,869
I'm at the station.

726
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:52,510
I'm okay.

727
00:57:53,739 --> 00:57:54,940
I'm really okay.

728
00:57:56,739 --> 00:57:57,880
What about you?

729
00:58:01,449 --> 00:58:03,480
Don't worry about me.
Are you okay?

730
00:58:14,829 --> 00:58:18,570
Excuse me. Who are you?

731
00:58:20,539 --> 00:58:21,639
Me?

732
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:28,239
Well...

733
00:58:36,019 --> 00:58:38,320
Eun Ha can't go
to kindergarten right now,

734
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:40,460
so I need someone
to look after her all day.

735
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:45,760
You're the only one I can trust.

736
00:58:47,030 --> 00:58:48,929
- It'll only be for a few days...
- I have a lot of time.

737
00:58:50,699 --> 00:58:53,940
So I'll take good care of her.

738
00:58:54,539 --> 00:58:55,840
I'll do a good job.

739
00:59:00,309 --> 00:59:01,409
Eun Ha.

740
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:04,650
This is your teacher who will
teach you how to draw now.

741
00:59:05,179 --> 00:59:08,579
Listen to your teacher well
and get close to her, okay?

742
00:59:09,019 --> 00:59:10,050
Okay.

743
00:59:10,949 --> 00:59:12,050
Teacher.

744
00:59:12,789 --> 00:59:14,789
I love drawing.

745
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,329
I can't tell you in detail yet,

746
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:25,070
but please don't worry.

747
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:29,369
We'll catch him no matter what.

748
00:59:31,170 --> 00:59:32,369
Okay.

749
00:59:32,809 --> 00:59:34,139
Mom.

750
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:36,480
Where's Dad?

751
00:59:39,949 --> 00:59:41,820
He promised to return soon.

752
00:59:42,349 --> 00:59:44,889
Dad will keep his promise.

753
00:59:47,690 --> 00:59:49,619
- Right. Your jacket.
- Take it with you.

754
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:53,059
I'll invite you to our house
when this is over.

755
00:59:53,730 --> 00:59:54,960
You can give it back then.

756
01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:08,239
Why don't you just leave like this?

757
01:00:14,519 --> 01:00:16,519
Even if you act like Cha Ji Won,

758
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:18,420
you can't become her.

759
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:23,690
No one can know...

760
01:00:23,989 --> 01:00:27,030
what they truly look like...

761
01:00:27,059 --> 01:00:28,829
until the moment of truth comes.

762
01:00:59,289 --> 01:01:02,460
(Public Official, Cha Ji Won)

763
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:04,099
I accidentally brought this with me.

764
01:01:10,239 --> 01:01:14,610
(Reporter Kim)

765
01:01:17,079 --> 01:01:19,409
- Yes, Mu Jin.
- Where are you, Hae Su?

766
01:01:20,349 --> 01:01:22,650
I came to your place right after
the police interrogation.

767
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:26,590
You're not here and all I see
is a suitcase.

768
01:01:27,389 --> 01:01:30,320
I'm with Eun Ha right now.

769
01:01:31,030 --> 01:01:32,159
"Eun Ha"?

770
01:01:33,059 --> 01:01:35,530
I'll go over after packing
some of Eun Ha's stuff.

771
01:01:36,099 --> 01:01:39,469
Okay. I don't know what it's about,
but I'll pick you up.

772
01:01:39,630 --> 01:01:41,199
No, it's okay.

773
01:01:41,739 --> 01:01:44,840
They caught the person
who was peeping.

774
01:01:45,139 --> 01:01:46,869
They did? Who was it?

775
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:49,110
Let's talk in person.

776
01:01:51,050 --> 01:01:54,320
I'm sorry about earlier.

777
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:56,019
What?

778
01:01:57,349 --> 01:02:00,690
I was harsh on you.

779
01:02:02,090 --> 01:02:05,190
Hey, I already forgot about it.
It's okay.

780
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:08,300
- Mu Jin.
- Yes?

781
01:02:09,429 --> 01:02:12,800
How could this necklace
still be the same?

782
01:02:14,570 --> 01:02:17,000
It still sparkles so beautifully.

783
01:02:19,070 --> 01:02:21,179
Are you wearing
the necklace I gave you right now?

784
01:02:22,139 --> 01:02:23,239
Since when?

785
01:02:23,679 --> 01:02:25,110
See you at home later.

786
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:26,809
Okay.

787
01:03:18,599 --> 01:03:19,900
What's wrong with the door?

788
01:03:21,639 --> 01:03:23,570
Did they seize and search
their house too?

789
01:03:24,239 --> 01:03:25,309
What?

790
01:03:26,269 --> 01:03:29,739
What? No, it's nothing.
Let's hurry and gather your stuff.

791
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:14,619
What's that sound?

792
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:16,590
Is Dad home?

793
01:04:19,590 --> 01:04:22,460
Eun Ha, stay here.
I'll go and check.

794
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:24,369
Okay.

795
01:04:35,639 --> 01:04:37,309
Why are the lights off?

796
01:04:55,559 --> 01:04:57,030
Detective Cha Ji Won?

797
01:04:58,829 --> 01:05:01,539
- Dad?
- Don't come out.

798
01:05:07,409 --> 01:05:10,480
Eun Ha. Lock the door.

799
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:16,449
Promise me.

800
01:05:17,289 --> 01:05:20,190
Don't open the door
unless it's Mom, okay?

801
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:24,230
Can you do that?

802
01:05:25,789 --> 01:05:26,860
Yes.

803
01:05:41,610 --> 01:05:46,150
(Cha Ji Won)

804
01:06:57,719 --> 01:06:59,519
I didn't want to do this either.

805
01:07:04,329 --> 01:07:05,929
But you make me too anxious.

806
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:10,530
You're a variable I can't control.

807
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:33,190
That's why I have no choice
but to get rid of you.

808
01:07:38,590 --> 01:07:39,960
Please let my daughter live.

809
01:07:41,329 --> 01:07:42,429
I'm begging you.

810
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:46,170
There's something...

811
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:52,039
I'm curious about.

812
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:55,880
I'll let her live if you answer me.

813
01:08:02,150 --> 01:08:04,449
Why do you think
Do Hyun Su is innocent?

814
01:08:08,789 --> 01:08:10,719
I'm wondering
if I made a mistake...

815
01:08:11,789 --> 01:08:13,460
while cleaning up
after Park Soon Young.

816
01:08:18,930 --> 01:08:20,229
You must have a reason.

817
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:30,079
Killing someone...

818
01:08:32,449 --> 01:08:33,750
is something...

819
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:38,090
he can't do.

820
01:08:43,189 --> 01:08:44,630
That's because...

821
01:08:46,859 --> 01:08:49,359
he's incapable of developing hatred
toward others to begin with.

822
01:09:14,460 --> 01:09:17,390
After speaking on the phone with him
last night,

823
01:09:17,390 --> 01:09:18,689
I haven't erased anything.

824
01:09:19,289 --> 01:09:20,859
Thank you for your cooperation.

825
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:22,729
Let's go.

826
01:09:28,869 --> 01:09:31,409
(Hide-and-seek. I can see you,
but you can't see me.)

827
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:47,890
Let me make this clear.

828
01:09:48,489 --> 01:09:51,060
First and foremost,
I need to get my money. Got it?

829
01:10:13,909 --> 01:10:16,350
(Public Official, Cha Ji Won)

830
01:10:47,010 --> 01:10:50,380
- Gosh.
- Hey, isn't it refreshing?

831
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:53,289
Come on.

832
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:58,029
Hey.

833
01:10:58,989 --> 01:11:00,930
Isn't it cool and refreshing?

834
01:11:01,859 --> 01:11:03,600
- Goodness.
- Goodness.

835
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:06,130
- Don't do that.
- Okay.

836
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:09,899
- Hey.
- Hyun Su, help me.

837
01:11:10,470 --> 01:11:11,869
Hyun Su.

838
01:11:14,039 --> 01:11:15,680
Bring it on!

839
01:11:16,539 --> 01:11:17,680
Gosh!

840
01:12:27,609 --> 01:12:31,989
(Flower of Evil)

841
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:35,060
Baek Hee Seong.

842
01:12:35,659 --> 01:12:38,590
Baek Hee Seong woke up.

843
01:12:39,189 --> 01:12:41,199
Where's your son?

844
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:46,199
You have no idea
why you deserve this.

845
01:12:47,170 --> 01:12:48,869
That's how I feel too.

846
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,369
Hi, it's nice to meet you.

847
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:54,909
Weren't you extremely curious
about me?

848
01:12:54,909 --> 01:12:56,239
Please come here quickly.

849
01:12:56,810 --> 01:12:59,880
Please save Mr. Do Hyun Su.
