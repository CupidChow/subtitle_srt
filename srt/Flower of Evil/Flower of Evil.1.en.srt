8
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:56,489
Should I tell you
what kind of person I am?

9
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:01,790
I promise to love you a lot
from now.

10
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:05,459
I'll be good to you.

11
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:10,740
Then at a certain point,
everything will start to change...

12
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:15,770

(Where the Morning Star Hovers,

14
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,039
What do we do? It's already 4pm!

15
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,409
We don't have time for this.
We're late.

16
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:26,479
You silly fool.

17
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,610
What if a customer walks in?

18
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:31,150
You're the one who got into the mood
because you liked the music.

19
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:35,150
Hurry and clean the shop
and get Eun Ha in her best outfit.

20
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,650
Make sure the brand name shows.

21
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,759
I have to go to the dry cleaner's
to pick up my stuff.

22
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:42,460
Why are you being so formal
when it's just us?

23
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,930
- What?
- Are you okay with it?

24
00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:53,810
I'm fine with it. I'm just worried
you'd be uncomfortable.

25
00:03:54,169 --> 00:03:57,740
We should see them more often.
They're still your parents.

26
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,150
They're Eun Ha's grandparents too.

27
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,949
I'm scared of Grandma.

28
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,819
Why are you scared of her?
She's your grandma.

29
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,990
You're scared of her too.

30
00:04:10,689 --> 00:04:12,120
When was I scared of her?

31
00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:36,009
Didn't you teach your daughter
how to greet someone?

32
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,319
It's because she remembers you
slamming the door on us...

33
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,480
last New Year's Day.

34
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:42,389
It's you who barged in
when I told you not to come.

35
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,819
How was your trip here?
Was this place hard to find?

36
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:46,990
It was okay.

37
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:53,259
Eun Ha. Shall we do
what we practiced earlier?

38
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:56,170
Come on, try it.

39
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:04,040
Grandma. Grandpa.

40
00:05:04,779 --> 00:05:06,279
I love you...

41
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,220
Let's go inside. My legs hurt.

42
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,730
Grandma hates Eun Ha.

43
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,569
No, it's okay.

44
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,569
If you try 10 times,
it'll work once, at least.

45
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,139
It's okay.

46
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:38,740
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

47
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:42,110
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

48
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:46,579
- Happy birthday, dear Dad
- Happy birthday, dear honey

49
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,089
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

50
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:54,629
Blow them out.

51
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,629
Eun Ha.

52
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:02,629
Happy birthday, Dad.

53
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:05,399
Your present is me. Baek Eun Ha.

54
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,139
Really? What a beautiful present.

55
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:11,709
This is from me.

56
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:14,050
You didn't have to prepare anything.

57
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,990
I love it. Thank you.

58
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,790
I even engraved your initials on it.

59
00:06:30,829 --> 00:06:31,899
Thank you.

60
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,300
Mom, I have to pee.

61
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,399
Okay. Let's go to the washroom.

62
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:46,980
Did you invite us
so that you could rub it in?

63
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,220
You shouldn't have come.

64
00:06:52,149 --> 00:06:53,620
You could've made up an excuse.

65
00:06:54,089 --> 00:06:56,050
Is it wrong for me to attend
my own son's birthday?

66
00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:01,930
Now, does the life you're leading
seem entirely yours?

67
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,430
Not at all.

68
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,100
It has never been mine,
to begin with,

69
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,600
so I don't even know
how it feels to be entirely mine.

70
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,569
Are you being sarcastic with me?

71
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,639
If it wasn't for me...

72
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:21,480
That's enough.

73
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,079
We're all in the same boat.

74
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:29,389
If you don't want it to sink,
don't provoke each other.

75
00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:37,329
- Sit down.
- Okay.

76
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,329
Hee Seong, I...

77
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,670
Okay. Should I drop you off?

78
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,870
No, it's okay. I can take a cab.

79
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:48,740
Mother and Father, I'm sorry.

80
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,009
Something came up.

81
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:52,379
You're taking revenge because
I slammed the door in your face...

82
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:54,050
last year, right?

83
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,579
It's not like that.

84
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,680
I really wanted
to treat you to a meal today.

85
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,589
It's cold outside. Wear this.

86
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:02,850
It's okay.

87
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,290
What should I do? I got
on the wrong side of her again.

88
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,089
It's fine.

89
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:10,029
I'll be going, then.

90
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,279
She must be stupider than I thought.

91
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:35,350
Your wife, that is.

92
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:37,389
We didn't know...

93
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,519
your marriage life
would be this happy.

94
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:45,299
It's because we're soulmates.

95
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,629
Ji Won and I.

96
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:49,669
What?

97
00:08:51,169 --> 00:08:54,539
(Gangsu Police Station)

98
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:05,850
Someone who has a dirty past
like you are soulmates...

99
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:07,620
with a cop?

100
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,659
You know how to be funny.

101
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,799
You've become more human.

102
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,370
Be honest.

103
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:31,909
This is still very important to us.

104
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:35,649
Now that you have a child,

105
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:40,620
have you become fond of her?

106
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:46,590
Ji Won only believes things
that she sees.

107
00:09:48,429 --> 00:09:52,230
And I only show her the things
I want her to see.

108
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,200
She's...

109
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,029
very simple.

110
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,139
So...

111
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,440
you don't have to worry.

112
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:40,179
At an apartment in Seokin-dong
at 3pm today,

113
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:43,179
a boy was found unconscious
on the staircase.

114
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,649
His head was severely injured.

115
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,120
His name is Kim In Seo,
and he is 12.

116
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:53,159
- In Seo.
- In Seo.

117
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,460
Are you okay?

118
00:10:56,659 --> 00:10:59,159
After undergoing surgery,
he didn't speak for some time.

119
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,500
Then the first thing he said was...

120
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,870
It was him.

121
00:11:09,409 --> 00:11:11,309
Dad did it.

122
00:11:13,179 --> 00:11:15,409
He tried to kill me.

123
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,549
"It was him. Dad did it."

124
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,460
According to his testimony...

125
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,039
Go back down.

126
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,480
Dad, I'm very exhausted.

127
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:52,350
I want to stop.

128
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,190
- Go.
- I'm too tired.

129
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,389
Look at your stomach.

130
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,259
Aren't you disgusted with yourself?

131
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,129
I'm... I'm sorry.

132
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,629
- Kim In Seo.
- Yes?

133
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:17,610
Every time I look at you,
I become enraged.

134
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,379
I can't believe you're my son.

135
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,240
He's lying, he's lying.

136
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,080
My son is lying.

137
00:12:55,549 --> 00:12:57,080
Mr. Kim Sang Jin.

138
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,450
Are you claiming...

139
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:00,750
that your 12-year-old son
is lying...

140
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:04,860
so that he can put you behind bars
for attempted murder?

141
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,120
"Attempted murder"?

142
00:13:08,929 --> 00:13:12,059
A child was severely injured
on a steep staircase...

143
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:13,700
with no cameras around.

144
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,029
His dad who was with him
suddenly disappeared,

145
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:18,600
and the boy claimed
that his dad did it.

146
00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:23,409
You do know that it's reasonable
for us to be suspicious,

147
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,110
don't you?

148
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,409
Come on, you can do it.

149
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,279
It's true that I made him
walk up the stairs.

150
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:29,279
Good boy.

151
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,049
But what he said was not true.

152
00:13:31,049 --> 00:13:33,720
You can do it, my son.
Hang in there.

153
00:13:34,289 --> 00:13:35,519
Good.

154
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,389
Hey, Eun Seok.

155
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,730
Right now? Okay, I'll be there.

156
00:13:46,929 --> 00:13:48,230
You should go home first.

157
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,799
I'll go home in the evening.

158
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,539
Make sure to stretch.

159
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,440
That's all.

160
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:02,379
My friend called and said
he was nearby, so we had a drink.

161
00:14:03,049 --> 00:14:04,850
That's when my wife called.

162
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,850
Detective.

163
00:14:09,389 --> 00:14:10,850
How could a parent do such a thing?

164
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,759
He's my precious boy.

165
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:19,259
This is horrible.

166
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,330
It just doesn't make sense.

167
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,039
What are you doing?

168
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:31,679
You had ribs, soju, and beer...

169
00:14:32,409 --> 00:14:33,980
with your friend?

170
00:14:38,179 --> 00:14:39,250
Yes.

171
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,809
Do you think he really did
that horrendous deed to his own son?

172
00:15:03,309 --> 00:15:06,039
He looks like a very decent guy
on the outside.

173
00:15:06,509 --> 00:15:09,710
Over 80 percent of those
guilty of child abuse are parents.

174
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:13,120
Ji Won, what's your take on this?

175
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,649
He seems to be falsely accused.

176
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,220
Every single person
we've interrogated seemed that way.

177
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,519
Come on, you're better than this.

178
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,629
No, look at his shoes.

179
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:25,029
His shoes? What about them?

180
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,429
Judging by his clothes,
I don't think they're his.

181
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,129
They're the restaurant's slippers.

182
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:34,970
While eating, he heard that his son
was injured and hurried out.

183
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,570
And only one of his socks is dirty.

184
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:44,179
The slipper probably fell off
since it wasn't his size.

185
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,889
Judging by the circumstances,
isn't this proof that he's innocent?

186
00:15:50,289 --> 00:15:51,360
I knew it.

187
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:54,529
That's your problem.

188
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:57,090
- What is?
- You have blind faith in evidence.

189
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,429
You should put his character
before evidence.

190
00:15:59,529 --> 00:16:00,759
You didn't notice...

191
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,029
- his slippers, right?
- Be quiet.

192
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:06,769
Then do you really believe
that he tried to kill his own son?

193
00:16:07,539 --> 00:16:08,610
Hear me out.

194
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:11,179
After I entered that room,

195
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:14,080
he and I locked eyes.

196
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:18,250
And I sensed it!

197
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:21,990
I sensed that he was the culprit.

198
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:23,519
Hey, check out these goosebumps.

199
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,990
You know what this means.

200
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,720
- You know it, right?
- Of course.

201
00:16:26,789 --> 00:16:29,090
- Ho Joon, what's your take on this?
- Me?

202
00:16:29,259 --> 00:16:30,960
Is it me or Ji Won? Hurry up.

203
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:34,129
I wasn't going to say this,

204
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:36,870
but he told me
that I was his role model.

205
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:41,269
Hey, Im Ho Joon.
You said I was your role model.

206
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,539
What?

207
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:45,909
No, I meant...

208
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:49,049
both of you are my role models.

209
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:51,549
She and I are totally different.

210
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,250
We've been summoned.

211
00:16:54,419 --> 00:16:56,149
Where are you going?
I'm talking to you.

212
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:07,529
I don't know if
you're aware of this,

213
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:10,130
but when you buy coffee,
they pack it up nice and neatly...

214
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,400
if you buy some extra cups.

215
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,640
I know.

216
00:17:12,769 --> 00:17:13,900
So you knew.

217
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,809
He knew, yet he only bought
coffee for himself?

218
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,009
- Detective Cha.
- Yes?

219
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:23,279
Question people around Kim Sang Jin.

220
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,450
And check the security footage
near the crime scene as well.

221
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:28,019
Yes, sir.

222
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:30,690
Detective Choi,
check Kim Sang Jin's...

223
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:34,630
I'll beat Kim Sang Jin up
and make him tell us the truth.

224
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:37,130
Check where he was
when the incident occurred.

225
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:39,299
And remember to use
legal measures only.

226
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:44,900
You can trust me, Captain.

227
00:17:45,869 --> 00:17:49,039
We'll go meet
Kim Sang Jin's wife first.

228
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:52,579
What?

229
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,480
I don't understand what you mean.

230
00:17:56,349 --> 00:17:58,319
I'm sorry, sir.

231
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,549
Can you tell me one more time?

232
00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:04,960
Did your husband usually show
an oppressive...

233
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,490
or authoritative attitude
towards your son?

234
00:18:08,829 --> 00:18:10,630
He tends to have a firm attitude.

235
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,400
My husband...

236
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:15,470
doesn't like it
when his plan is altered.

237
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:18,269
He has a fixation for his plans.

238
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:22,609
Have you ever felt he lacks
a sense of empathy?

239
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,910
What? What do you mean?

240
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:29,380
Are you already thinking of
a headline, Mr. Kim?

241
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,119
(I Hate My Obese Child)

242
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:34,650
"I Hate My Obese Child".

243
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:36,650
"The dad that made his son
climb the stairs of death."

244
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:37,650
What do you think?

245
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,690
Mr. Kim, do you know
you look overly excited right now?

246
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:42,930
You should hold back,
since we're in a hospital.

247
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:46,230
To be honest, this is totally
my type of case.

248
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,400
Well, I found the articles you post
on the internet lately pretty fun.

249
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,599
Which one did you like the most?

250
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,769
That one, the serial murder case
in Yeonju.

251
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:59,910
I never knew there was a case
like that in our country.

252
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,079
It was awful.
The whole neighborhood was...

253
00:19:04,819 --> 00:19:05,920
What?

254
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:09,319
Never mind. What's the father's job?

255
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,460
- Who?
- The stairs of death.

256
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,930
- He's an attorney.
- An elite father?

257
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:19,059
This is really nice. It's perfect.

258
00:19:20,029 --> 00:19:22,200
I even like how my pen
doesn't work right now.

259
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,900
Sir, use this.

260
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:25,539
What is this?

261
00:19:25,569 --> 00:19:27,910
Detective Cha's husband
gave it to us as a present.

262
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,109
It looks nice.

263
00:19:29,109 --> 00:19:30,470
He crafts metal for work.

264
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:33,279
Metal craft?

265
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,450
What an interesting job.

266
00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:42,490
Did your son ever complain
or seem unhappy about anything?

267
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,390
Ma'am.

268
00:19:48,859 --> 00:19:49,990
Yes?

269
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,829
I'm sorry.

270
00:19:52,829 --> 00:19:56,299
I know it's hard, but your statement
is really important.

271
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:59,839
Detective, my son, In Seo,

272
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,210
is not someone who lies.

273
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,109
He's such a nice boy.

274
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,079
Then what about your husband?

275
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:10,450
Do you think he's capable
of hurting your son?

276
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:11,519
No!

277
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,380
How could you say...

278
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,750
Detective, there's nothing wrong
with our family.

279
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,559
There's been nothing wrong
all this time!

280
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,299
I don't know...

281
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:31,200
why something like this happened.

282
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:33,099
Why on earth...

283
00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:38,009
I'm just asking this
out of formality.

284
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:41,450
Is your son insured
for any insurance policies?

285
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,880
Yes.

286
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:45,779
What about it?

287
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:47,920
See? I told you.

288
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,619
They're after the insurance payout.

289
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:50,890
No, they're not.

290
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,920
There's a clause that states
the child won't receive...

291
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,829
a death benefit
if he's under the age of 15.

292
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:00,859
They're financially stable too,
so that can't be a motive.

293
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:04,069
Come on, there doesn't need to be
a fancy motive to kill.

294
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:07,269
There's even someone who killed
seven people for no reason...

295
00:21:07,269 --> 00:21:09,640
and buried them in a mountain
nearby.

296
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:13,279
And even his wife, who ran away
a long time ago,

297
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:14,750
was found in that mountain too.

298
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:16,509
All that remained were
her skeletons.

299
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:18,220
Who are you talking about?

300
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:20,720
I heard your husband
knows how to craft metal.

301
00:21:21,589 --> 00:21:22,650
Yes.

302
00:21:23,589 --> 00:21:25,619
That murderer was
a metal craftsman too.

303
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,430
I think I heard
that story somewhere.

304
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:30,789
If I tell you this,

305
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,299
can I get that expensive-looking pen
for free too?

306
00:21:35,299 --> 00:21:36,430
If I give you this for free,

307
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:39,299
will you advertise this
on your social media?

308
00:21:40,069 --> 00:21:41,339
Of course.

309
00:21:41,339 --> 00:21:43,839
Then I look forward to
your cooperation.

310
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:46,079
(Where the Morning Star Hovers,
Baek Hee Seong)

311
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:47,839
But it's so strange.

312
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:51,579
Why do you use honorifics
while Mr. Kim talks down to you?

313
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:53,880
Since he's a year older than me.

314
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,990
No, he's not. He was born in 1985.
He's a year younger than you.

315
00:21:57,519 --> 00:21:58,759
Don't they have any ketchup here?

316
00:21:59,289 --> 00:22:01,289
What? You were born in 1985?

317
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,700
How could you tell me that now?

318
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,299
Do you know what's the strangest
about this case?

319
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:13,599
The woman who is the victim's mom
and the accused's wife.

320
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,269
What about her?

321
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:19,039
Her son almost died and pointed out
his dad as the perp,

322
00:22:19,509 --> 00:22:22,079
but all she says is
that her family is fine.

323
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,009
That's all she keeps saying.

324
00:22:25,049 --> 00:22:28,650
There must've been signs
if things were such a mess.

325
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:31,460
But how could she be so clueless?

326
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,930
I don't know if she's avoiding it
or hiding something.

327
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:37,559
Anyhow, something isn't right.

328
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,599
You're really just getting changed
and going out this late?

329
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,670
I've always been like this.

330
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:48,269
By the way, are your parents
angry at me?

331
00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:50,140
Don't mind them.

332
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:53,539
Why do they hate me so much?

333
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,950
I'm not the type that
people dislike, you know.

334
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:59,019
I have a nice personality,
nice features,

335
00:22:59,019 --> 00:23:00,480
and even had their grandchild.

336
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:02,619
I'm even a civil servant.

337
00:23:02,619 --> 00:23:04,920
What do you think my problem is,
honey?

338
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:08,059
There you go again,
bragging about yourself.

339
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,299
I know you're upset.

340
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:17,369
You've grown apart from your parents
because of me.

341
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,670
Don't say that.

342
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:25,180
I shouldn't have hit on you
if I knew this would happen.

343
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,450
Call Detective Im. That you have
more urgent matters to attend to.

344
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:38,619
Come on, cut it out.

345
00:23:38,619 --> 00:23:40,519
Why? Stay with me a little longer.

Ho Joon, look at this.

348
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,380
He's wearing shoes
until this moment.

349
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,220
I'm sure he wore those slippers
from the restaurant.

350
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:16,589
He doesn't seem like someone
who's running away.

351
00:24:17,529 --> 00:24:19,559
He actually seems excited.

352
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:22,369
Don't you think? Hey.

353
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,440
- He's out cold.
- Are you wasting your time?

354
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:30,940
I'm investigating.

355
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,640
An investigation based on
an incorrect assumption.

356
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,009
That's called, "wasting your time".
Write it down.

357
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:38,079
Last time, you told me I'll find
something...

358
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:39,750
as long as I gather every single
piece of small evidence...

359
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,279
and told me to write that down too.

360
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,450
By tomorrow, I'll sort out
this whole mess.

361
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,920
I just feel sorry for you.

362
00:24:47,059 --> 00:24:48,230
Do you know something?

363
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:53,359
Keep wasting your time then.

364
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,599
Hold on. I should go to the sauna.

365
00:24:59,369 --> 00:25:01,240
I'm certain he knows something.

366
00:25:04,009 --> 00:25:05,140
Watch your step.

367
00:25:07,779 --> 00:25:09,210
Have a good day today.

368
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,380

Hello, sir.

370
00:25:12,349 --> 00:25:14,890
I made some extra
while I was making breakfast.

371
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:16,490
You can share
with the other teachers.

372
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:18,190
Gosh, you didn't have to.

373
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:22,529
My goodness.

374
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:25,000
I heard all of you skip breakfast.

375
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:30,299
Eun Ha, I envy your mom so much.

376
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:31,769
Why?

377
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:35,039
Since your dad is kind,
a great cook,

378
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,240
and even handsome.

379
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,569
Does that mean you want me to leave?

380
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:39,910
He's witty too.

381
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,680
- I'll be off then.
- Okay.

382
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,910
Eun Ha, I'll see you later.

383
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:45,950
Dad, bye, bye.

384
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,380
Bye, bye.

385

I'm only suggesting a direction.

So, are you telling me...

00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:23,940
to call your wife
and be harsh to her?

and child, right?

- Get up.

Look what I found.

434
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:48,420
This is from the approximate time
of the incident.

435
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:51,130
In Seo was found on
the emergency stairs' landing...

Excuse me.

440
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:16,289
I'm here to see Dr. Bae Eun Seok.

There she is.

442

I remember Mr. Kim referring to you
as a guy.

443
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:34,200
Sang Jin and I are close friends.

444
00:30:34,269 --> 00:30:35,670
We were in the same university club.

445
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:40,539
Was Mr. Kim Sang Jin different
from usual yesterday?

446
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,150
No, he was the same.

447
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,849
He was as funny as usual.

448
00:30:45,619 --> 00:30:49,690
Of course, that was before he got
the call about In Seo.

449
00:30:50,589 --> 00:30:54,920
How strange. Why didn't you
go to the hospital with Mr. Kim?

450
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,990
It's not like you two have
anything to hide.

451
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:00,700
The kid even got
treated in this hospital before.

452
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:05,130
Actually,
I drank too much last night.

453
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:07,539
It's not that I didn't go,
I couldn't go.

454
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:13,079
What are you doing?

455
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,680
You're right.

456
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,779
You still reek of alcohol.

457
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,819
My patients are waiting.

458
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,890
Okay. If you remember anything,
please call me.

459
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:28,160
Hold on. Where is my business card?

460
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:37,599
My goodness.

461
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:43,170
Can you pick up the ones
that rolled to your side?

462
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,240
Okay.

463
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:56,250
- Here you go.
- Gosh.

464
00:31:57,089 --> 00:31:58,519
Thank you.

465
00:32:00,789 --> 00:32:02,329
We can't decode passwords anymore.

466
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:04,059
Try it.

467
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,799
I only need to check her pictures.

468
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:07,329
I told you, it's not like before.

469
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,769
Do it.

470
00:32:14,769 --> 00:32:16,809
Hey, she has an SD card.

471
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,160
I knew it.

472
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:38,359
I could smell a woman's perfume
rubbed on him.

473
00:32:39,529 --> 00:32:43,400
The perfume belonged
to his "friend".

"A cockroach"?

476
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:20,200
Yes. I take those vitamins
every day,

477
00:33:21,069 --> 00:33:22,869
but I found a cockroach in it.

478
00:33:26,309 --> 00:33:29,349
It can't go in there by itself
unless someone put it in there.

479
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:33,519
By the way,
what brought you detectives here?

480
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:38,450
Please take a look at this.
Do you recognize him?

481
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:41,490
He's the kid from the 12th floor.

482
00:33:42,089 --> 00:33:43,289
Unit 1201.

483
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:44,990
His name is...

484
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,069
What was it again?

485
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,700
Why can't I recall?

486
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:59,279
It's Ji Hoon. Yoon Ji Hoon.

487
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,849
Detective Cha, is my husband...

488
00:34:04,849 --> 00:34:06,349
doing okay?

489
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,119
Of course.

490
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:11,320
Are you giving him
his meals on time?

491
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:15,559
What about you, Ms. Go?
Did you eat today?

492
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:19,300
In Seo and my husband get along
really well.

493
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,099
They even go hiking together.

494
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,300
- It's been seven years already.
- Just a minute.

495
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,269
Kim Sang Jin's affair was confirmed.

496
00:34:29,269 --> 00:34:32,239
Tell his wife, then secure
related testimony from her.

497
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:37,210
Did something happen?

498
00:34:37,579 --> 00:34:38,820
No, it's nothing.

499
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,420
I can't live without my son
and my husband.

500
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,219
Please make sure no one gets hurt.

501
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,329
I'm begging you.

502
00:35:26,699 --> 00:35:30,230
(Where the Morning Star Hovers)

503
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,400
Excuse me.

504
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,309
Feel free to look around.

505
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:46,150
Do you fix silver items as well?

506
00:35:46,849 --> 00:35:48,150
A friend of mine told me
about this place.

507
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:50,150
Is Mr. Baek Hee Seong in?

508
00:35:55,659 --> 00:35:57,090
Who told you?

509
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:12,710
Are you...

510
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:15,980
I'm sorry, but we're closing
a bit early today.

511
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,050
Do Hyun Su.

512
00:36:26,889 --> 00:36:28,090
It's you, isn't it?

513
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:34,730
Don't you remember me?
I'm Kim Mu Jin.

514
00:36:59,659 --> 00:37:01,320
It is you.

515
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,590
So?

516
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:05,829
What?

517
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,800
So what are you going to do?

518
00:37:09,969 --> 00:37:12,440
Oh, nothing. I was just taken aback.

519
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,809
I'm here to see Mr. Baek Hee Seong.

520
00:37:17,409 --> 00:37:18,869
He's Detective Cha Ji Won's husband.

521
00:37:19,909 --> 00:37:21,340
Is he not here?

522
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:30,789
Do you two know each other?

523
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:33,519
- What?
- Do you know...

524
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,320
Detective Cha?

525
00:37:36,829 --> 00:37:39,559
Yes, a bit.

526
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:48,769
Do you want some tea?

527
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:50,710
What?

528
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:52,739
I happen to have some nice tea.

529
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,030
Why couldn't you tell Ms. Go
back there?

530
00:38:09,889 --> 00:38:11,360
You pitied her, didn't you?

531
00:38:12,699 --> 00:38:14,329
It's not that.

532
00:38:15,699 --> 00:38:18,329
I knew Detective Choi didn't pick
that phone up by coincidence.

533
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:21,070
I didn't tell her because
it wasn't valid proof.

534
00:38:22,139 --> 00:38:23,840
Had she known he had cheated on her,

535
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,980
she could've shared
some crucial information.

536
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,539
Think sensibly.

537
00:38:27,809 --> 00:38:30,550
His affair and this case
have no connections.

538
00:38:36,619 --> 00:38:38,789
Recently, Kim Sang Jin asked
a fellow lawyer for some advice...

539
00:38:38,789 --> 00:38:40,659
regarding divorce and child support.

540
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:43,329
He seemed very reluctant
about paying child support.

541
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:45,929
Are you still wasting your time?

542
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,869
I hear Kim Sang Jin and his son
regularly went hiking together.

543
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:52,329
It was for the past seven years,
and they were happy about it.

544
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:57,070
Do you know what kind of lunatics
cause the biggest headache?

545
00:38:59,539 --> 00:39:01,280
One who's very patient.

546
00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:11,050
My gosh, Hyun Su.

547
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,360
Thanks.

548
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,889
I barely recognized you.

549
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,389
But you did.

550
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:23,699
Right. That's because...

551
00:39:23,699 --> 00:39:26,269
you and I grew up
in the same neighborhood.

552
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:28,039
Anyway, you've changed a lot.

553
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,210
Don't you think
it's a bit hot today?

554
00:39:36,179 --> 00:39:37,349
I'm sweating.

555
00:39:37,579 --> 00:39:38,679
Is that so?

556
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:42,949
I feel fine.

557
00:39:47,489 --> 00:39:48,590
Is it just me?

558
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:53,860
Your body temperature keeps rising
because you're holding back.

559
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:56,570
- What?
- You can ask me.

560
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,800
Ask me the question
that popped into your head...

561
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,840
the moment you saw me.

562
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:08,210
There is none. Don't be absurd.

563
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,480
My goodness. There's none.

564
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,150
I should go now.
I have an appointment.

565
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:19,860
Don't you want to know?

566
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,730
I bet you're curious.

567
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:27,329
Aren't you a reporter?

568
00:40:31,869 --> 00:40:33,099
Ask me.

569
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:48,050
First of all,

570
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:50,389
I don't believe anything
until proven otherwise.

571
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:53,719
The rumors about you...

572
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,829
are still fictitious to me.

573
00:41:02,699 --> 00:41:03,800
Really?

574
00:41:06,869 --> 00:41:10,440
Hyun Su, I don't know
if you know this.

575
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:13,179
But 18 years ago,

576
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:17,309
on the day you disappeared,

577
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,119
there was a murder.

578
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:25,550
Our village head...

579
00:41:27,489 --> 00:41:28,659
was killed.

580
00:41:44,539 --> 00:41:45,710
So?

581
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:52,550
Do you have anything...

582
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:55,280
to do with it?

583
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:17,010
Yesterday, Ddol ran away.

584
00:42:20,309 --> 00:42:22,280
Ddol! Come here!

585
00:42:22,809 --> 00:42:24,050
Ddol!

586
00:42:30,949 --> 00:42:34,820
Ddol had bitten In Seo before,

587
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:39,260
so he's scared of Ddol.

588
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:46,570
You should've told me about this.

589
00:42:47,239 --> 00:42:51,269
His mom said she'd euthanize Ddol...

590
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:54,079
if it happened again.

591
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:56,750
That's why I couldn't tell you.

592
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:01,920
In Seo's mom is very strict
and thorough.

593
00:43:03,019 --> 00:43:06,059
She must've intimidated my son.

594
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:12,489
What? "Ddol"?

595
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:17,869
Are you telling me
that the culprit was a dog?

596
00:43:17,869 --> 00:43:19,539
Aren't you relieved...

597
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:21,500
that it's not his dad?

598
00:43:23,269 --> 00:43:27,179
The boy accurately remembered
what In Seo wore that day.

599
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:30,409
His testimony was detailed.
It's highly credible.

600
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:33,579
Then why in the world...

601
00:43:33,579 --> 00:43:36,119
did In Seo accuse his own dad?

602
00:43:36,519 --> 00:43:38,150
Based on what the others told me,

603
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:40,119
he was extremely stressed
about losing weight.

604
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:42,260
Shouldn't we hand this over
to the Women and Juvenile Division?

605
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:45,059
I'm sure I sensed it.

606
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:49,469
Jae Seop, can I tell you
a favorite saying of mine?

607
00:43:49,699 --> 00:43:50,869
No.

608
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,699
"An investigation based on
an incorrect assumption..."

609
00:43:53,869 --> 00:43:57,170
- "is wasting your time."
- "is wasting your time."

610
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:00,980
Darn it.

611
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:04,650
What's wrong?

612
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:06,349
It's my wisdom tooth.

613
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:16,159
You're allowed to go home.

614
00:44:17,659 --> 00:44:18,989
We found a witness.

615
00:44:28,969 --> 00:44:31,010
What's the point in denying?

616
00:44:33,139 --> 00:44:36,010
Everyone thinks that I did it.

617
00:44:36,679 --> 00:44:38,949
You, the village people,

618
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:40,849
and even the police.

619
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:45,349
Why did they find the murder weapon
in your backpack?

620
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:48,489
Why are you still wanted?

621
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:50,590
If you're innocent,

622
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:52,389
you should be interrogated
voluntarily...

623
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:53,900
and clear your name.

624
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:02,869
How did you know
that I'm still wanted?

625
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,039
Did you look into it?

626
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,079
Why?

627
00:45:09,079 --> 00:45:10,349
Well...

628
00:45:11,409 --> 00:45:13,579
I just heard it from somewhere.

629
00:45:13,579 --> 00:45:15,780
When you're a reporter...

630
00:45:17,019 --> 00:45:19,619
I should really go now.
Thanks for the tea.

631
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:20,989
What now?

632
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:24,360
Are you going to scurry
over to the police station...

633
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:26,059
and say that you met Do Hyun Su,

634
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:27,829
the murderer who killed
the village head in Gagyeong-ri...

635
00:45:27,829 --> 00:45:29,260
18 years ago?

636
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:32,670
Is that what you're going to do?

637
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:35,900
Come on.

638
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:38,710
I'm not that interested
in other people's business.

639
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:48,920
How about we talk about you
instead of me?

640
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:50,889
Well, I'm...

641
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,420
Are you married?

642
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:58,429
Eating and drinking alone
is the trend lately.

643
00:45:58,690 --> 00:45:59,829
And I'm a trendy guy.

644
00:46:00,699 --> 00:46:01,829
I better get going.

645
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,230
Did you say you're a reporter
for a weekly magazine?

646
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:06,400
It's nothing much.

647
00:46:06,969 --> 00:46:09,469
- I'll see you then.
- Then...

648
00:46:12,409 --> 00:46:14,079
I guess you have flexible
working hours.

649
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:28,559
Which one doesn't have side effects?

650
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:30,090
There's no medicine like that.

651
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:31,559
Even vitamins have side effects.

652
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:34,929
It's three dollars.

653
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:37,030
(Multivitamins)

654
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:38,269
Let me see.

655
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:40,039
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

656
00:46:41,269 --> 00:46:42,909
- Ji Won, let's go.
- Okay.

657
00:46:45,539 --> 00:46:47,079
You should just pluck
that tooth out.

658
00:46:47,079 --> 00:46:49,010
How could I just pluck out
a healthy tooth?

659
00:46:49,179 --> 00:46:50,780
It's mine even if it hurts.
I'll never get rid of it.

660
00:46:53,449 --> 00:46:54,550
What is it?

661
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:58,750
What's wrong?

662
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:02,590
These are the vitamins Ms. Go takes.

663
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:04,489
Yes. So?

664
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:07,300
Do you remember the color of
the pills she spilled?

665
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:11,230
They were white.

666
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:26,079
There's nothing wrong
with our family.

667
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:27,920
There's been nothing wrong
all this time!

668
00:47:33,389 --> 00:47:36,929
In Seo's mom is very strict
and thorough.

669
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:38,559
His name is...

670
00:47:42,329 --> 00:47:43,570
What was it again?

671
00:47:43,769 --> 00:47:45,369
Why can't I recall?

672
00:47:54,110 --> 00:47:55,340
Can you step out for a second?

673
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:58,349
Why? I want to stay.

674
00:47:58,449 --> 00:47:59,550
Please.

675
00:48:01,949 --> 00:48:03,090
Okay.

676
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:15,900
Is there anything left
to investigate?

677
00:48:16,929 --> 00:48:17,929
(Record)

678
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:22,670
It's you, isn't it?

679
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,309
The one who put the cockroach
in the bottle.

680
00:48:26,539 --> 00:48:28,639
To stop your mom from taking them.

681
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:37,190
I know there's a reason
why you lied.

682
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:45,030
In Seo, let's have your mom...

683
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:48,530
make the choice on her own.

684
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:55,639
I want my mom...

685
00:48:57,539 --> 00:48:58,639
Yes?

686
00:48:59,639 --> 00:49:01,340
to leave.

687
00:49:15,659 --> 00:49:19,289
I don't want her to hear what I say.

688
00:49:23,329 --> 00:49:24,900
- Dad is...
- There you go.

689
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,099
a good person.

690
00:49:26,969 --> 00:49:28,139
To me, at least.

691
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,139
In Seo!

692
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,610
Hello.

693
00:49:33,239 --> 00:49:35,139
- You're here.
- How have you been?

694
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:39,349
Dad, can I have some tissue?

695
00:49:39,449 --> 00:49:40,519
Take the picture.

696
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:46,420
- Did you bring it?
- Yes.

697
00:49:49,489 --> 00:49:50,730
It's not too dangerous, is it?

698
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:53,659
It's a drug that will block
her neural stimulation temporarily.

699
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:55,500
Once she stops taking it,
she'll be fine.

700
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:58,199
She's become
a totally different person.

701
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,170
She's slow, sluggish,
and blank all day.

702
00:50:03,139 --> 00:50:04,309
One time...

703
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:06,980
Honey.

704
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:09,309
What is this?

705
00:50:10,679 --> 00:50:11,980
It seems like lipstick.

706
00:50:12,349 --> 00:50:13,719
She saw that smudge.

707
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:16,179
So I just blurted out...

708
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:18,119
It's paint.

709
00:50:18,949 --> 00:50:20,090
Paint?

710
00:50:20,090 --> 00:50:22,789
I went to a cafe that had just
gone through a renovation.

711
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,489
I guess it got on my shirt.

712
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:35,340
You're right. It looks like paint.

713
00:50:38,539 --> 00:50:39,880
What's wrong with me lately?

714
00:50:42,179 --> 00:50:44,309
Just make sure she signs
the papers now.

715
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:46,780
Why is getting divorced
so difficult?

716
00:50:46,949 --> 00:50:48,420
Then did you think
it would be easy...

717
00:50:49,789 --> 00:50:52,989
to get custody and all the money
when you're cheating?

718
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,489
Cut it out.

719
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:59,489
I couldn't tell my mom.

720
00:51:01,329 --> 00:51:03,800
I told myself I should tell her
numerously...

721
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,400
(Recording)

722
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:06,900
but I couldn't say it.

723
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,039
So I thought...

724
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:13,710
if my dad was mean to me,

725
00:51:15,309 --> 00:51:16,409
then...

726
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:20,150
my mom wouldn't be so sad.

727
00:51:21,849 --> 00:51:22,949
I'm sorry.

728
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:37,929
What are they talking about?

729
00:51:38,869 --> 00:51:40,940
You're forcing a minor to make
a statement...

730
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:43,969
without a parent next to him.

731
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:47,639
I'll never let this slide.

732
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:02,360
Did you get the answer you wanted...

733
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:05,429
about child abuse
or whatever nonsense?

734
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,699
You should know well
since you're an attorney.

735
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:10,500
What kind of crime it is...

736
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:13,500
to make someone take drugs secretly
without their consent.

737
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:15,840
Mr. Kim Sang Jin.

738
00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:19,170
You're under arrest for causing
bodily damage to Ms. Go Hae Yeong.

739
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:22,139
You have the right
to remain silent...

740
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:24,480
and the right to an attorney.

741
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,369
Hey, there's no need for that.

742
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:46,539
I don't need a gift. It's okay.

743
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:49,769
I'm asking you not to tell anyone
you saw me here.

744
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:51,739
It's a bribe.

745
00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:54,309
Hey, I'm good at keeping secrets.

746
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,510
Don't worry about it.

747
00:52:59,349 --> 00:53:02,650
Mu Jin, can you come over here
and write your address?

748
00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:04,320
I'll send it to your home.

749
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:10,360
Okay.

750
00:53:23,369 --> 00:53:24,840
I don't see Mr. Baek Hee Seong.

751
00:53:26,539 --> 00:53:28,139
I heard he owns this place.

752
00:53:28,139 --> 00:53:29,579
(Where the Morning Star Hovers)

753
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,809
Do you think she really didn't know?

754
00:53:56,909 --> 00:53:58,739
What? What are you talking about?

755
00:53:59,510 --> 00:54:00,739
I mean Ms. Go.

756
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:04,550
Do you really think she didn't know
what Kim Sang Jin was doing?

757
00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:06,510
Come on, if she knew that,

758
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:09,449
would she have taken the drugs
he gave her?

759
00:54:13,019 --> 00:54:14,519
Something crossed my mind though.

760
00:54:14,619 --> 00:54:16,960
(Multivitamins)

761
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,730
If a certain truth can destroy
your life instantly,

762
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:29,599
and you also know that the truth...

763
00:54:29,869 --> 00:54:32,139
will be revealed someday.

764
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:35,679
But if you can put off
that moment for another day,

765
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:40,449
I would take that pill.

766
00:54:40,719 --> 00:54:43,050
What? Have you lost your mind?

767
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:44,349
Me too.

768
00:54:44,789 --> 00:54:47,420
I just eat anything
my wife gives me.

769
00:54:47,619 --> 00:54:50,489
And one day, if my wife
puts poison into my mouth,

770
00:54:50,489 --> 00:54:53,730
I'd rather die than taking it out
and checking what it is.

771
00:54:54,829 --> 00:54:56,260
What's wrong with you
married people?

772
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,630
I don't want to get married
even more.

773
00:54:57,869 --> 00:54:59,699
I was right eventually.

774
00:55:00,969 --> 00:55:02,070
What do you mean?

775
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:05,039
I was right.
Kim Sang Jin was the bad guy.

776
00:55:05,269 --> 00:55:08,840
No, it's not like Kim Sang Jin
hurt In Seo.

777
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:10,480
Stop being stubborn.

778
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,679
You're such a bad judge
of character.

779
00:55:13,349 --> 00:55:14,719
Ho Joon, you tell us.

780
00:55:14,949 --> 00:55:17,050
Me? Tell you what?

781
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:19,289
Who's right? Me or Ji Won?

782
00:55:21,019 --> 00:55:22,960
Well, I think both of you...

783
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,260
Just choose one of us.

784
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:25,960
Don't try anything funny.

785
00:55:26,289 --> 00:55:27,329
I think...

786
00:55:28,599 --> 00:55:30,769
Someone's calling you, Ji Won.
Your phone.

787
00:55:30,769 --> 00:55:31,829
(Mother)

788
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:34,639
Right.

789
00:55:35,070 --> 00:55:37,269
Tell me. Sit back down.

790
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:41,539
Yes, Mother.

791
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,039
I don't like you.

792
00:55:44,949 --> 00:55:47,519
- Sorry?
- Are you in your right mind?

793
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:50,190
Do you think you're good enough
for Hee Seong?

794
00:55:50,619 --> 00:55:52,750
He's the son of the director
of a hospital.

795
00:55:54,289 --> 00:55:56,090
I'll try harder, Mother.

796
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:58,559
I heard daughters take after
their moms.

797
00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:00,929
Your mom tormented her husband.

798
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:06,969
Mother, that's a bit harsh...

799
00:56:06,969 --> 00:56:09,139
You haven't changed a bit, have you?

800
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:12,110
You got yourself pregnant
and married my son,

801
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:14,440
and now you use your daughter
as an excuse?

802
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:16,980
Do you think I'll give you
any of my money?

803
00:56:19,909 --> 00:56:22,519
Listen carefully. You disgust me.

804
00:56:23,789 --> 00:56:26,389
Let's pretend we're strangers
to each other.

805
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:27,860
Don't forget that.

806
00:56:29,889 --> 00:56:32,730
- Mother
- What? Do you feel angry?

807
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:37,300
It's not that.

808
00:56:38,130 --> 00:56:39,329
About what you said today.

809
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,800
I hope Hee Seong
doesn't know about it.

810
00:56:45,539 --> 00:56:48,210
Although he doesn't say anything,
he's very stressed...

811
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:51,309
to see you and me in conflict.

812
00:58:17,469 --> 00:58:18,630
- It's pretty.
- Is it?

813
00:58:19,530 --> 00:58:22,599
Here. Shall we eat it?

814
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:34,280
Shall we add this? Let's add this.

815
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,019
What's next? Let's see.

816
00:58:37,349 --> 00:58:39,820
Dad, my nose is bleeding.

817
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:42,460
What is that? Are you okay?

818
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:44,590
I fooled you!

819
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:47,360
Eun Ha.

820
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:49,260
Eun Ha?

821
00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:52,730
- Mom!
- My sweetie.

822
00:58:52,769 --> 00:58:53,940
You're home.

823
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,010
Eun Ha, Mom is tired.

824
00:58:57,010 --> 00:58:59,039
No, I'm not.
I'm so happy right now.

825
00:58:59,539 --> 00:59:00,710
Come here, honey.

826
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:02,909
Did you have a long day?

827
00:59:02,909 --> 00:59:04,949
Come on, give me some energy.

828
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:08,119
Good work.

829
00:59:10,219 --> 00:59:12,190
Eun Ha, can you giggle like that
again?

830
00:59:12,190 --> 00:59:13,860
I love that sound.

831
00:59:14,090 --> 00:59:15,619
You need to make me laugh.

832
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:18,889
- Shall I tickle you?
- Dad, help me.

833
00:59:18,989 --> 00:59:20,230
Shall I make Mom laugh too?

834
00:59:21,199 --> 00:59:22,559
Help me!

835
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:24,269
Eun Ha, let's run away.

836
00:59:24,929 --> 00:59:27,039
I'm going to catch you.

837
00:59:27,070 --> 00:59:28,940
Come here!

838
00:59:29,699 --> 00:59:31,039
Let's run away!

839
00:59:32,539 --> 00:59:34,239
I caught you.

840
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:42,110
(Where the Morning Star Hovers)

841
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:13,909
(Flower of Evil)

842
01:01:17,079 --> 01:01:18,980
His thumbnail is missing again.

843
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:20,980
It's exactly the same as
the Yeonju Serial Murder Case...

844
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:22,320
that occurred in 2002.

845
01:01:24,119 --> 01:01:26,590
The case Reporter Kim mentioned
last time?

846
01:01:27,889 --> 01:01:29,789
If you're in too much pain,

847
01:01:31,090 --> 01:01:32,429
don't hold back and tell me.

848
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:35,500
Then things will get
more interesting for me.

849
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:36,800
Where is Mom?

850
01:01:36,829 --> 01:01:39,800
Mom said she's going to clean
your workroom.
