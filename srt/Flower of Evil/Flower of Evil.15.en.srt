I swear I heard something.

11
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:50,390
Hae Su,
are you that scared of ghosts?

12
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:52,159
Aren't you scared?

13
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,359
It's my wish to meet one.

14
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,460
Tell Mu Jin to go downstairs alone.

15
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:59,299
You're too scared to do that, right?

16
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:02,929
Hey, you just wait here.

17
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,140
I'll interview the ghost
and come back.

18
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,340
Watch out.

19
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:08,670
All right.

20
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:14,310
Reporter Kim, moving in. Let's go.

21
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,819
I'm already scared.

22
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:26,659
Okay, I'll go slowly.

23
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:31,000
One step at a time.

24
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:46,180
That's creepy.

25
00:01:58,790 --> 00:01:59,859
This is crazy.

26
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:05,599
What's this?

27
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,370
What is that?

28
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:24,849
What are you doing there, Mu Jin?

29
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,789
You're brave, aren't you?

30
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,330
My kids are too scared
to even touch the basement doorknob.

31
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,599
Did you
record something interesting?

32
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:43,939
Let's see.

33
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:46,939
Kim Mu Jin.

34
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:50,610
Gosh.

35
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,240
Mu Jin, why are you shaking?

36
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:00,389
Were you surprised to see the elk?

37
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:03,250
Is it an elk?

38
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,590
Of course.

39
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,689
If it's not an elk, what is it?

40
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:10,960
So it was an elk.

41
00:03:12,699 --> 00:03:15,430
It's an elk. Yes, it's an elk.

42
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,400
Right?

43
00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:21,310
How could this necklace
still be the same?

44
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,610
It still sparkles so beautifully.

45
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,180
Are you wearing
the necklace I gave you right now?

46
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,650
Since when?

47
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:32,219
See you at home later.

48
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,819
Okay.

(Cha Ji Won)

51
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,370
Who on earth is he?

52
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:24,240
Who is it?

53
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,910
I can't tell you
until I know I'm safe.

54
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:30,910
Why should I tell you?
Once you find out who he is,

55
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,639
you might lure him to stab me
in the back.

56
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:36,649
If for some reason...

57
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:39,819
you get in the way before
I run away with the money,

58
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:43,050
I'll stand on his side and kill
both you and Jung Mi Sook.

59
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,160
Do you love money that much?

60
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,589
Just its scent...

61
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,259
makes me tingle.

62
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:08,850
If I don't go just because
she tells me not to,

63
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,980
we wouldn't be an item.

66

67
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,360
Hae Su!

68
00:05:57,259 --> 00:05:59,529

69
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,199

70
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:07,709
Hae Su! Hae Su! Hae Su, wait.

71
00:06:07,769 --> 00:06:08,810
Hae Su...

72
00:06:14,149 --> 00:06:17,079
There's an emergency patient.
Please hurry.

73
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,149
(Makmun-dong murder)

74
00:06:19,149 --> 00:06:22,389
Murder victim Park Soon Young
arrives at Gong Mi Ja's house...

75
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:24,189
at 10am on the 12th for work.

76
00:06:24,189 --> 00:06:26,160
(10am arrives at work)

77
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,459
At 7:30pm that night,
she leaves Gong's house...

78
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:30,829
and got in a taxi.

79
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,230
This is the last record of her
seen alive.

80
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,240
Her whereabouts after this...

81
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,540
were recorded
by her credit card transactions.

82
00:06:42,339 --> 00:06:45,939
She paid for the taxi at 7:50pm

83
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,750
At around 8pm, she ordered...

84
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,680
delivery food
using a food delivery app.

85
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,550
The menu was pork kimchi stew.

86
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,819
The delivery man confirmed
he handed over the food...

87
00:06:55,819 --> 00:06:58,019
directly to Park Soon Young
at 8:30pm.

88
00:06:58,189 --> 00:07:01,329
This means she was alive...

89
00:07:01,329 --> 00:07:02,660
until 8:30pm.

90
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,230
(8:30pm, delivery man arrives)

91
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:08,870
So? What do you find strange?

92
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,540
The presumed time of death.

93
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,870
"The presumed time of death"?

94
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,040
If you look at the autopsy report,

95
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:18,480
it says she died within 4 to 6 hours
after eating.

96
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:20,949
She ordered the food at 8:30pm,

97
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:23,879
which means we should assume
she died after 12:30am.

98
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,589
But according to this record,

99
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,449
all of her finger joints were stiff.

100
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:33,829
That means at least ten hours passed
since she died.

101
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:37,160
But she should've died before 9pm
for it to have been 10 hours.

102
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,769
One says it was after 12am,
while the other says before 9pm.

103
00:07:41,769 --> 00:07:43,699
The times don't overlap.

104
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,310
Depending on the environment,

105
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,509
a body can stiffen and decompose
at different speeds.

106
00:07:50,209 --> 00:07:51,540
That's why the NFS...

107
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:54,079
couldn't pinpoint the exact time
just from an autopsy.

108
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,180
Like you said, one thing for sure...

109
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:00,220
is that Park Soon Young
was alive yesterday until 8:30pm.

110
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,550
What's important...

111
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,819
is where she went after that.

112
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:09,829
I know. I know that...

113
00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:16,269
I think I better meet
that delivery man in person.

114
00:08:17,269 --> 00:08:20,470
He might have seen someone
suspicious around her home.

115
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,639
This investigation was poorly done.
I'll be back.

116
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:28,009
I got the dashcam footage
I mentioned earlier.

117
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:37,690
This is certain. He lured
my husband out at this time.

118
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,230
It matches the time
he claims to have received the call.

119
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,230
I'll ask to get this video analyzed.

120
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:44,299
Wait.

121
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,100
I bet he chose a place
without security cameras on purpose.

122
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:50,639
But why wasn't he careful
with dashcams?

123
00:08:51,669 --> 00:08:54,340
This is a fatal mistake
for a criminal.

124
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,679
This is solid proof
that he called Do Hyun Su.

125
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,179
I don't get it either.

126
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:09,620
Detective Cha, don't pick up
if you don't recognize the number.

127
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,059
- It could be a reporter.
- Yes, sir.

Where's my daughter?

132
00:09:40,549 --> 00:09:43,820
She's in there, but she'll only
open the door for her mom.

133
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:47,330
We didn't want to frighten her
by breaking it open.

Eun Ha.

135
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:11,149

Mom...

145
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:46,879
Are you okay?

146
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:48,590
Are you hurt?

147
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,860
There was a thief.

148
00:10:54,289 --> 00:10:55,730
Ms. Do told me...

149
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:00,730
to go to my room and lock the door.

150
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,970
She told me to only open it for you.

151
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:10,039
Good girl. You did well.

152
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:15,179
Where is she?

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,509
My name is...

168
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,679
Do Hyun Su.

169
00:13:29,149 --> 00:13:31,649
The accomplice
of the Yeonju Serial Murder...

170
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:33,980
is after you.

171
00:13:35,419 --> 00:13:36,789
He'll arrive here soon.

172
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:40,289
And it's because...

173
00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:45,330
you're the sole survivor
and witness...

174
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,799
of that incident.

175
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,230
And...

176
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,539
I'm going to catch him.

177
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:12,190
Please don't come near me.
Please...

178
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,789
Please don't come near me.

179
00:14:35,179 --> 00:14:36,779
This is only one key...

180
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,120
to this lock.

181
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:56,169
You're the only one...

182
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:00,269
who can open this door.

183
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:04,240
You're safe.

184
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,080
You have my word.

185
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,450
So...

186
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,919
You're helping me?

187
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,159
Yes.

188
00:15:21,789 --> 00:15:22,830
Liar.

189
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:25,429
I don't believe you.

190
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:32,500
That man also said
that he'd help me meet my family.

191
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,940
But he deceived me.

192
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,549
Why?

193
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:50,620
Why are you helping me?

194
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,429
I think it's because...

195
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:05,600
you and I...

196
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,639
are in similar situations.

197
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,480
Why do you think so?

198
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,850
Because you have no idea...

199
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,750
why you deserve this.

200
00:16:27,259 --> 00:16:29,059
I feel the same way right now.

201
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:03,789
Mom, I should head out now.

202
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:06,160
Ji Won.

203
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:08,400
Let's...

204
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:11,839
just stay here together, okay?

205
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,869
Let's just hide here.

206
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:16,970
Mom.

207
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:19,880
How could this happen to us?

208
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,220
This is all because of Hee Seong,
isn't it?

209
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,819
Right?

210
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,349
He completely deceived you...

211
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,720
and made you miserable.

212
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:36,359
I hate him terribly.

213
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:43,500
I still feel the same way.

214
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,869
I can only be happy if he's happy.

215
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,240
So...

216
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:55,779
please pity him when he returns.

217
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:02,250
Embrace him as you embrace me.

218
00:18:15,099 --> 00:18:16,970
Isn't he the guy from the dashcam?

219
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:19,740
That scumbag
was after Ji Won, right?

220
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,470
He was waiting
in front of her house.

221
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:24,410
What's his deal?

222
00:18:25,309 --> 00:18:27,009
Don't you think...

223
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,950
we should leak
some fake information?

224
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,279
Fake information?

225
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,950
If he realizes
that Detective Cha's still alive,

226
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,220
she'll be in danger.

227
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,589
We still haven't identified him yet.

228
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,190
Yes, you're right.

229
00:18:42,259 --> 00:18:45,160
I'll discreetly leak
some information to the reporters.

230
00:18:45,259 --> 00:18:47,200
You should ask...

231
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,329
- Mapo Police Station for backup.
- Yes, sir.

232
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,000
Is this Mapo Police Station?

233
00:18:54,769 --> 00:18:57,609
(Operating Room, Restricted Area)

234
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:03,980
It's my fault.

235
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,349
I promised Hyun Su.

236
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,920
That I'd never leave her alone.

237
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,029
I promised him.

238
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:21,329
They didn't find any marks
of resistance on Hae Su's body.

239
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,240
She didn't resist or run away...

240
00:19:28,269 --> 00:19:30,769
to protect Eun Ha.

241
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,579
You can catch him, right?

242
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,450
Yes.

243
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:40,220
At all costs.

244
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:52,759
The weapon penetrated
her abdomen and damaged her organs.

245
00:19:53,099 --> 00:19:55,769
Due to shock from
excessive bleeding, for now,

246
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,630
we can't be sure of anything.

247
00:19:58,069 --> 00:20:00,299
We need to wait
until she regains consciousness.

248
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,849
Director Baek Man Woo.

249
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,759
What?

250
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:23,289
Hae Su asked him for a favor.

251
00:20:24,029 --> 00:20:25,099
What favor?

252
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:29,000
The list of overseas medical
volunteers of Ilsin Hospital.

253
00:20:29,769 --> 00:20:31,740
From 1999 to 2002.

254
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:33,700
What for?

255
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:36,910
Hae Su said the accomplice
was one of the members...

256
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,210
from the period.

257
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,240
I'll go get the list first.

258
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:43,380
I'll explain in detail
at the police station.

259
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,380
Let me go with you!

260
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:51,519
Yes, Ho Joon.

261
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:52,690
Ji Won.

262
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:56,029
You can't be alive today.

263
00:20:58,029 --> 00:20:59,029
What?

264
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:01,259
("Female Detective
of Gangsu Police Station...")

265
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:03,299
("Attacked and Murdered
at Her Home")

266
00:22:41,099 --> 00:22:42,869
It's been a long time,
Ms. Jung Mi Sook.

267
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,910
Do you remember me?

268
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:01,589
You said you didn't remember me
when you were found 15 years ago.

269
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:07,990
You do remember me.

270
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,450
You haven't changed a bit.

271
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,289
Okay.

272
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,599
Let's never meet each other now.

273
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:27,970
I'm thinking the same thing.

274
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:31,940
Bye, bye.

275
00:24:54,869 --> 00:24:57,430
Why do you think
we always meet like this?

276
00:24:59,869 --> 00:25:01,299
I guess...

277
00:25:02,609 --> 00:25:05,509
no matter how much you run away,
you can't get away from me.

278
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,619
This is your fate.

279
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:50,420
He was trying to kill me.

280
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:56,259
He doesn't know how I look.

281
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:59,730
- What?
- What do you mean?

282
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,400
How could he not know my face
when he waited to kill me?

283
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,769
He even took my husband's
fingerprint...

284
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:12,309
and planted the victim's hair
in our trunk. But how...

285
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:15,210
could he not know my face?

286
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:18,109
That's really strange.

287
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,250
What if...

288
00:26:22,049 --> 00:26:24,150
the culprit isn't one person?

289
00:26:26,259 --> 00:26:27,589
It was the first time
I delivered to that house.

290
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:30,490
Was there anything suspicious
when you handed her the food?

291
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,160
I just gave her the food.

292
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:36,200
The victim had a hearing impairment.

293
00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:40,200
Did she wear a particular face
or show any gestures?

294
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:43,210
No.

295
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:46,339
Please look at this photo.

296
00:26:46,339 --> 00:26:48,480
Did you ever see him
near that house?

297
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:51,250
I really don't know.

298
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:54,519
Okay.

299
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:56,849
If you think of anything later...

300
00:26:59,019 --> 00:27:02,789
But she didn't have
a hearing impairment.

301
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:04,789
What?

302
00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:08,059
There was a doorbell
next to the front door.

303
00:27:08,329 --> 00:27:11,130
Oh, that's a door light.

304
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,500
If you press the bell,
a light comes on inside.

305
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,869
It's not that. I didn't...

306
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,839
press the bell.

307
00:27:20,779 --> 00:27:21,849
Delivery.

308
00:27:22,049 --> 00:27:23,049
I knocked on the door.

309
00:27:26,349 --> 00:27:27,380
Enjoy.

310
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,450
Many homes have babies
in that neighborhood,

311
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:30,819
so knocking became a habit.

312
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:36,259
The culprit may be
more than one person.

313
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:40,400
The one who gathered information
and the one who killed...

314
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:42,369
could be different.

315
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:47,670
It's Detective Choi.

316
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:49,609
(Detective Choi)

317
00:27:50,309 --> 00:27:51,309
Yes, Detective Choi.

318
00:27:51,609 --> 00:27:54,339
Check the food they found
in Ms. Park's stomach...

319
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,710
from the autopsy result.

320
00:27:57,609 --> 00:28:00,150
Pork, kimchi, and a bit of tofu.

321
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,450
We don't use tofu at our restaurant.

322
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,990
The time Park Soon Young died
was after lunch, not dinner.

323
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:13,559
At 7:30pm when she left
Gong Mi Ja's house,

324
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:16,829
Park Soon Young was already dead.

325
00:28:16,829 --> 00:28:17,900
(Gangsu Police Station)

326
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,369
Then who is that?

327
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,539
Who is that person?

328
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:27,740
Someone who wants to protect
the criminal no matter what.

329
00:28:35,349 --> 00:28:36,349
Enjoy.

330
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:38,220
The criminal's...

331
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,720
mom.

332
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:44,529
Hae Su said the accomplice
was one of the members.

333
00:28:44,529 --> 00:28:45,859
from the period.

334
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:47,430
Baek Hee Seong.

335
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,799
I know why the criminal didn't
think about dashcams.

336
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:54,539
There weren't any 15 years ago.

337
00:28:57,170 --> 00:29:00,039
Baek Hee Seong woke up.

338
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:15,829
What on earth?

339
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:28,170
Yeom Sang Chul, that rat.

340
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:36,950
Come here.

341
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,150
Come to this side.

342
00:29:42,289 --> 00:29:44,920
I said, come here! Come here!

343
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:48,289
I said, come here!

344
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,470
What is that?

345
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:03,839
What are you all conspiring to do?

346
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:13,180
What are you looking at?

347
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:04,670
Stop... Stop... I lost. I lost.

348
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:06,700
You're killing me.

349
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:10,710
Stop hitting me! It hurts!

350
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:16,750
You should check who I am
before you hit me, you lunatic!

351
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:33,430
Hello. Nice to see you.

352
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:40,069
I bet you were curious to find out
who I was.

353
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:43,809
How does it feel?

354
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:52,619
You look surprised.

355
00:31:57,589 --> 00:32:00,019
Ms. Do Hae Su
was stabbed with a weapon?

356
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:02,190
Yes.

357
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,599
How bad is her condition?

358
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:14,539
She's still unconscious.

359
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:17,740
Are you sure the one who attacked
Ms. Do Hae Su...

360
00:32:19,109 --> 00:32:22,210
is the murderer
of the Yeonju Serial Murder Case?

361
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:24,109
I'm sure.

362
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:28,549
That's why we need the list
and the pictures of the volunteers.

363
00:32:29,819 --> 00:32:32,420
I heard Hae Su asked you for it.

364
00:32:34,789 --> 00:32:37,730
But she's unconscious.

365
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,900
How would the list
and the pictures help?

366
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:45,299
We'll check their alibis
for every single one of them.

367
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:48,099
Instead of going to the foundation,

368
00:32:48,869 --> 00:32:52,579
I figured it'd be faster
to see you and came in a hurry.

369
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,240
I'm glad you came.

370
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:57,349
I have it prepared already.

371
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,849
Please wait a moment.

372
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,019
(Gangsu Police Station's Cha Ji Won)

373
00:33:09,789 --> 00:33:11,089
Please excuse me.

374
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,069
Yes, Detective Cha.

375
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:21,269
Reporter Kim. From now on,
only answer in yes or no.

376
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,170
Okay.

377
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:26,809
Are you at Baek Man Woo's house
right now?

378
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,309
- Yes.
- Is there someone beside you?

379
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,750
- Yes.
- Leave that house quietly.

380
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:37,390
What?

381
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,319
We've specified...

382
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:42,690
Do Min Seok's accomplice
who tried to murder Do Hae Su.

383
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:46,160
Who is that?

384
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:48,660
Baek Man Woo and Gong Mi Ja's
real son.

385
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:51,170
Baek Hee Seong.

386
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,099
Don't react.

387
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,109
Baek Man Woo and Gong Mi Ja
are likely accomplices.

388
00:34:01,009 --> 00:34:03,410
We'll dispatch once we get
a search warrant.

389
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:06,279
Just leave that place quietly.

390
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,559
What's the matter, Reporter Kim?

391
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:17,329
Where's your son right now?

392
00:34:20,329 --> 00:34:22,900
Where's Baek Hee Seong?

393
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,300
Reporter Kim!

394
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:29,010
We should go even if
we don't have a warrant yet.

395
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:31,769
Reporter Kim's enraged.
He could be in danger.

396
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,550
What are you doing?

397
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:41,280
I said, what are you doing?

398
00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:50,860
How could you do this
when it's not your house?

399
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:51,889
Baek Hee Seong!

400
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,400
Let's sit down and talk.

401
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:57,130
You must have a misunderstanding.
Tell me what it's about.

402
00:34:58,099 --> 00:34:59,739
Let's talk!

403
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:12,010
No!

404
00:35:13,349 --> 00:35:14,380
Please move.

405
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:16,820
Don't do this. No.

406
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,219
It's all meaningless.

407
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,119
The police are already on their way.

408
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,920
He's not here.

409
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:53,460
Your son should be lying there...

410
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:55,860
unconscious.

411
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,789
You can't leave.

412
00:36:31,929 --> 00:36:35,159
Don't you see
this is all meaningless?

413
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:38,940
Why is it meaningless?

414
00:36:40,369 --> 00:36:41,599
All I have to do is kill you.

415
00:36:42,969 --> 00:36:45,739
After I kill you,
I'll turn myself in.

416
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:47,610
What difference would that make?

417
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:50,150
It'll make a difference for my son!

418
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:56,920
If I sacrifice for him,
it'll make a difference.

419
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:00,820
He wasn't like this before.

420
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:05,329
He wouldn't have
turned out like this...

421
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,900
if he never met Do Min Seok.

422
00:37:09,429 --> 00:37:10,570
I want...

423
00:37:11,869 --> 00:37:15,500
to give him one last chance.

424
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:18,840
"Chance"?

425
00:37:23,809 --> 00:37:24,809
When I was young,

426
00:37:26,019 --> 00:37:27,980
I saw a really big sack...

427
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:31,219
in Do Min Seok's basement workshop.

428
00:37:35,289 --> 00:37:37,329
Were you surprised to see the elk?

429
00:37:38,929 --> 00:37:41,000
- Is it an elk?
- Of course.

430
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,300
If it's not an elk, what is it?

431
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:47,739
So it was an elk.

432
00:37:49,409 --> 00:37:50,440
It's an elk.

433
00:37:51,139 --> 00:37:52,139
Yes, it's an elk.

434
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:55,780
To this day, I told myself...

435
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,250
that there was an elk...

436
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:03,250
in that sack.

437
00:38:04,519 --> 00:38:05,519
Why?

438
00:38:06,489 --> 00:38:07,820
Because if I didn't believe so,

439
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:14,960
then it'd be too terrifying.

440
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,730
But...

441
00:38:21,869 --> 00:38:23,639
no matter how many times
I told myself that,

442
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,539
I knew that a human...

443
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:30,880
was in that sack.

444
00:38:39,219 --> 00:38:40,820
You guys knew from the start...

445
00:38:42,889 --> 00:38:44,130
what Baek Hee Seong had...

446
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,900
inside of him.

447
00:38:50,869 --> 00:38:52,469
It's not his future...

448
00:38:53,369 --> 00:38:54,869
that you want to change.

449
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,809
It's that very first moment...

450
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,010
when you turned a blind eye...

451
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:08,179
after finding out his true colors.

452
00:39:12,289 --> 00:39:13,320
So...

453
00:39:14,789 --> 00:39:15,860
you'd better...

454
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,590
give up already.

455
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,869
Let me go!

456
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:39,119
It's our responsibility...

457
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,679
to reveal the truth.

458
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,690
You better stay alive and finish...

459
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:46,960
what you're here for.

460
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:15,420
It's quite strange.

461
00:40:18,389 --> 00:40:19,460
We already knew...

462
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:23,730
that this was bound to happen.

463
00:40:26,099 --> 00:40:27,099
So...

464
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:31,130
why did we come...

465
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:34,239
this far?

466
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,530
How did it feel
to be dancing to my tune?

467
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:02,730
I finally get it.

468
00:41:07,539 --> 00:41:10,269
Now, I know how you trapped me.

469
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:14,880
Don't gloat too much
over the fact that you've caught me.

470
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:22,050
You'll always be living
in my shadows.

471
00:41:43,639 --> 00:41:44,809
Why did you do it?

472
00:41:52,849 --> 00:41:54,519
Why did you do that to me?

473
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:58,619
I don't reflect on my past actions.

474
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,429
I'll be spending my entire life
in prison anyway.

475
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:17,670
Where's the phone?

476
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:20,980
The phone you used
to call Yeom Sang Chul.

477
00:42:26,519 --> 00:42:28,849
I'll probably be in the limelight,
right?

478
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:31,349
The phone.

479
00:42:32,659 --> 00:42:34,820
Should I publish a book
while I'm incarcerated?

480
00:42:37,159 --> 00:42:39,530
I'll write about my upbringing,

481
00:42:41,099 --> 00:42:43,769
what Do Min Seok and I did,

482
00:42:44,699 --> 00:42:46,639
the things we talked about,

483
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:52,110
and how we sublimed the murders
we had committed into art.

484
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,210
I bet everyone's dying to know.

485
00:42:57,679 --> 00:42:59,579
How popular do you think
my book will be?

486
00:43:08,389 --> 00:43:09,989
Don't try too hard.

487
00:43:11,489 --> 00:43:14,699
You can't affect me whatsoever.

488
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:23,070
The phone's in my left pocket.

489
00:43:26,739 --> 00:43:28,579
Tell them to hurry and arrest me.

490
00:43:29,849 --> 00:43:31,110
Also,

491
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:34,320
call an ambulance
while you're at it.

492
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:37,650
I think I need one.

493
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:48,960
Hyun Su is different.

494
00:43:52,969 --> 00:43:54,570
He's a failure of mine...

495
00:43:55,639 --> 00:43:58,309
despite all the effort
I put into him.

496
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:04,150
What's with that face?

497
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:07,480
You can be happy.

498
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:11,349
You're my most impressive work.

499
00:44:22,429 --> 00:44:28,840
(Cha Ji Won)

00:44:34,409 --> 00:44:39,210
(Cha Ji Won)

501
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,019
Give that back.

502
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:51,389
It's my souvenir.

503
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:56,929
Why...

504
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:00,869
Why do you have this?

505
00:45:02,769 --> 00:45:03,840
Isn't it obvious?

506
00:45:11,849 --> 00:45:13,019
Don't lie.

507
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:15,349
I liked your house.

508
00:45:16,849 --> 00:45:19,559
Which one of you thought
about putting that model boat...

509
00:45:19,889 --> 00:45:21,059
behind the TV?

510
00:45:22,829 --> 00:45:23,889
It was just my style.

511
00:45:34,269 --> 00:45:35,739
Don't lie to me.

512
00:45:40,809 --> 00:45:42,139
Tell me it's a lie.

513
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:47,880
Tell me right now!

514
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:54,820
Do Min Seok turned me into a killer.

515
00:45:57,429 --> 00:45:59,829
And I'm going to do
the same for you.

516
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:05,000
It's only fair.

517
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,809
Hurry up and call the police.

518
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:11,269
Go with the plan!

519
00:46:13,639 --> 00:46:14,710
I don't believe you.

520
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:23,849
I won't believe a word you say.

521
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:28,260
"Eun Ha, Promise me."

522
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:32,929
"Don't open the door
unless it's Mom, okay?"

523
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,829
"Can you do that?"

524
00:46:42,639 --> 00:46:43,940
It was touching.

525
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,880
I almost shed a tear.

526
00:46:57,449 --> 00:46:59,090
I didn't touch your daughter,
though.

527
00:47:02,789 --> 00:47:04,730
That would've been below my level.

528
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:29,449
Please...

529
00:47:31,989 --> 00:47:33,389
Please answer the phone.

530
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:45,530
The number you have called
cannot be reached right now.

531
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:46,699
You will be directed to voicemail.

532
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:55,610
This is the police
information center.

533
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:01,179
I have something to report.

534
00:48:04,719 --> 00:48:07,619
Please connect me
to Detective Cha Ji Won...

535
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,699
of Violent Crimes Unit 3
of Gangsu Police Station.

536
00:48:15,099 --> 00:48:17,030
If you hang up the phone and wait,

537
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:18,900
the detective in charge
will call you.

538
00:48:38,719 --> 00:48:39,860
Hello?

539
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:41,789
This is the Violent Crimes Unit
of Mapo Police Station.

540
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:44,690
Are you the person who called
regarding the detective's assault?

541
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:48,159
What do you want to report?

542
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:51,969
Is...

543
00:48:55,739 --> 00:48:56,769
the victim...

544
00:49:00,679 --> 00:49:02,480
really Detective Cha Ji Won?

545
00:49:03,849 --> 00:49:05,110
Yes, it is.

546
00:49:12,789 --> 00:49:13,789
And her condition?

547
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:16,730
She's dead.

548
00:49:26,369 --> 00:49:27,440
Hello?

549
00:49:29,539 --> 00:49:30,539
Hello?

550
00:49:31,309 --> 00:49:32,440
What about her daughter?

551
00:49:34,809 --> 00:49:35,840
She's safe.

552
00:50:19,219 --> 00:50:21,489
I'll win no matter what.

553
00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:26,289
Even if you hand me over
to the police, I'll win.

554
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:30,199
And even if you kill me, I'll win.

555
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:34,969
This is a game you can never win.

556
00:50:57,489 --> 00:50:59,159
Call the police.

557
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:02,860
No, don't.

558
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:06,440
That Do Hyun Su...

559
00:51:09,639 --> 00:51:11,139
has killed someone.

560
00:51:13,309 --> 00:51:15,639
Don't do that because of
a jerk like him.

561
00:51:27,889 --> 00:51:29,519
Tell them that I chopped off
his arms and legs...

562
00:51:30,659 --> 00:51:32,260
while he was alive...

563
00:51:37,829 --> 00:51:39,000
and that...

564
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:42,800
I mauled his face so badly...

565
00:51:44,139 --> 00:51:45,710
that no one could even
recognize him.

566
00:51:48,309 --> 00:51:49,409
And yet,

567
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:55,449
he survived and crawled
on the ground.

568
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:01,119
So I had to kill him...

569
00:52:03,929 --> 00:52:05,130
again...

570
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:08,659
and again...

571
00:52:10,869 --> 00:52:13,130
and again, countless times.

572
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:15,199
No...

573
00:52:33,789 --> 00:52:36,119
Run away! Run away now!

574
00:52:37,059 --> 00:52:38,260
Run away!

575
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:41,960
Run away!

576
00:52:59,349 --> 00:53:01,150
Please don't go.

577
00:53:04,119 --> 00:53:05,150
What the...

578
00:53:06,989 --> 00:53:08,059
Darn.

579
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:35,420
Where is Baek Hee Seong right now?

580
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:39,019
We really don't know.

581
00:53:40,659 --> 00:53:42,889
All we know is that he went
to meet Yeom Sang Chul.

582
00:53:43,190 --> 00:53:44,329
How could you not know?

583
00:53:44,889 --> 00:53:46,699
You are all accomplices.

584
00:53:46,699 --> 00:53:48,500
- Detective Cha, calm down.
- I can't.

585
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:52,670
That murderer is with my husband
right now.

586
00:53:55,039 --> 00:53:56,039
My son...

587
00:53:57,809 --> 00:53:59,139
is physically ill.

588
00:54:01,610 --> 00:54:02,610
He won't...

589
00:54:04,010 --> 00:54:06,110
be able to hurt Hyun Su.

590
00:54:06,550 --> 00:54:09,079
What is Baek Hee Seong's
car license plate number?

591
00:54:09,449 --> 00:54:12,489
It's 54G7065.

592
00:54:12,489 --> 00:54:15,389
Captain. We got a call
from Mapo Police Station.

593
00:54:15,389 --> 00:54:17,159
There was a man who asked
if Detective Cha was dead.

594
00:54:17,789 --> 00:54:18,889
This is the number.

595
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:23,199
Do you know this number?

596
00:54:29,239 --> 00:54:31,110
I don't know the number.

597
00:54:33,909 --> 00:54:36,909
But he had an old phone
that he used...

598
00:54:36,909 --> 00:54:38,409
to keep in touch
with Yeom Sang Chul.

599
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:41,550
But the thing is,

600
00:54:42,579 --> 00:54:43,820
he also asked about the kid.

601
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:46,860
Baek Hee Seong wouldn't have
asked that question.

602
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:48,460
He knew Eun Ha wasn't hurt.

603
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:02,739
Oh, no.

604
00:55:04,039 --> 00:55:05,340
He called me.

605
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:46,980
Hello?

606
00:55:47,619 --> 00:55:49,420
This is Detective Cha Ji Won
of Gangsu Police Station.

607
00:55:51,190 --> 00:55:52,250
Who are you?

608
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:56,460
You're Detective Cha Ji Won?

609
00:55:58,389 --> 00:55:59,659
Who is this?

610
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:02,429
Are you...

611
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:06,429
Jung Mi Sook?

612
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:10,769
Please come here quickly.

613
00:56:12,610 --> 00:56:15,710
Please save Mr. Do Hyun Su.

614
00:56:21,050 --> 00:56:25,389
(Intensive Care Unit)

615
00:56:25,389 --> 00:56:32,789
(Intensive Care Unit)

616
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,829
Excuse me. How is Patient Do Hae Su?

617
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:38,969
You can't see her right now.

618
00:56:39,269 --> 00:56:41,739
- Please wait outside...
- Just tell me how she is.

619
00:56:41,739 --> 00:56:43,099
Tell me about
her current condition.

620
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:45,570
What is your relationship
with the patient?

621
00:56:47,309 --> 00:56:48,639
I'm a friend.

622
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:51,179
If you're not her legal guardian,

623
00:56:51,179 --> 00:56:53,210
we can't tell you
about her condition.

624
00:56:53,650 --> 00:56:57,349
She lived alone for a long time.
What legal guardian?

625
00:56:58,550 --> 00:56:59,750
Please, just do me a favor.

626
00:57:00,219 --> 00:57:02,760
I'm sorry. It's our regulations.

627
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:05,190
Ma'am...

628
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:38,820
Run away.

629
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:41,860
Just kill me if you're going
to do it, you psychopath!

630
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:44,860
I said, run away.

631
01:00:04,610 --> 01:00:06,980
Baek Hee Seong ran away,
and Do Hyun Su went after him.

632
01:00:07,210 --> 01:00:09,440
We're searching around the building
as well as the hill.

633
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,250
- Let's go.
- Detective Cha.

634
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:14,550
She said she needed to see you
before leaving.

635
01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:23,059
This is Detective Cha.

636
01:00:30,099 --> 01:00:31,300
Ms. Jung Mi Sook.

637
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,969
That man said he killed you.

638
01:00:43,179 --> 01:00:48,079
(Cha Ji Won)

639
01:00:52,019 --> 01:00:53,719
I felt so sorry for Mr. Do Hyun Su.

640
01:00:55,989 --> 01:00:57,789
Even if...

641
01:01:00,059 --> 01:01:01,860
he kills that man,

642
01:01:04,199 --> 01:01:05,929
it's not Mr. Do Hyun Su's fault.

643
01:01:07,570 --> 01:01:10,070
He's not at fault. I saw everything.

644
01:01:12,409 --> 01:01:15,239
No modifier can go in front
of the word "murder".

645
01:01:17,050 --> 01:01:18,050
Murder...

646
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:22,750
is just murder.

647
01:01:28,889 --> 01:01:30,789
Thank you for being alive.

648
01:03:31,210 --> 01:03:32,250
Kill me.

649
01:03:34,420 --> 01:03:35,480
Hurry up and kill me.

650
01:03:39,019 --> 01:03:40,960
You'll be the one...

651
01:03:43,690 --> 01:03:45,989
suffering in pain for a long time.

652
01:04:22,599 --> 01:04:23,630
Honey!

653
01:04:40,349 --> 01:04:41,420
Honey.

654
01:04:49,519 --> 01:04:51,090
Throw away the knife
and come over here.

655
01:04:51,929 --> 01:04:53,360
Leave it to the police now.

656
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:03,340
Are you...

657
01:05:05,469 --> 01:05:07,340
really Cha Ji Won?

658
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:11,380
What are you talking about?

659
01:05:32,099 --> 01:05:34,170
I think Do Hyun Su
is in an unstable state.

660
01:05:35,869 --> 01:05:36,869
Detective Cha,

661
01:05:37,610 --> 01:05:38,739
step back.

662
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:40,880
Honey, what are you doing?

663
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:43,139
I said, throw away the knife
and come over here.

664
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:45,150
He said...

665
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:47,880
He said you died.

666
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:50,750
No. It was all a plan.

667
01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:53,389
You can see that I'm alive.

668
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:17,650
Cha Ji Won!

669
01:06:18,710 --> 01:06:20,050
What are you doing? Come back here!

670
01:06:20,409 --> 01:06:21,480
Detective Im.

671
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:23,719
Detective Cha's safety
is our priority.

672
01:06:23,820 --> 01:06:26,989
In the worst case, you can fire.

673
01:06:27,820 --> 01:06:28,860
Yes, sir.

674
01:06:41,969 --> 01:06:43,239
It's over.

675
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:47,739
All you have to do is come here.

676
01:06:52,050 --> 01:06:53,309
I...

677
01:06:57,889 --> 01:07:01,059
I can see dead people.

678
01:07:11,269 --> 01:07:13,469
I can't believe...

679
01:07:13,969 --> 01:07:16,639
that you're real.

680
01:07:20,010 --> 01:07:22,280
Then you can come here and hug me.

681
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:26,309
Come here. Come give me a hug.

682
01:08:10,090 --> 01:08:13,059
Everyone, stay alert.

683
01:09:11,689 --> 01:09:15,119
Let Do Hyun Su be
and apprehend Baek Hee Seong.

684
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:44,750
Doctor, Ms. Do is awake.

685
01:11:04,369 --> 01:11:06,369
How long have I been here?

686
01:11:09,739 --> 01:11:11,010
I can't remember.

687
01:11:19,710 --> 01:11:21,550
I think we're by the seaside.

688
01:11:25,390 --> 01:11:27,489
But why can't I hear the waves?

689
01:11:30,260 --> 01:11:31,829
Don't question anything.

690
01:11:33,159 --> 01:11:34,960
That way, you can forget
about everything.

691
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:38,170
Okay.

692
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:44,199
You worked hard your entire life.

693
01:11:46,210 --> 01:11:47,510
I'm truly grateful for that.

694
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:51,510
You can rest now.

695
01:11:55,180 --> 01:11:56,250
I have given you...

696
01:11:58,819 --> 01:12:00,890
so much pain all this time,
haven't I?

697
01:12:04,060 --> 01:12:06,489
I loved you just as much,
so it's all right.

698
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:12,529
Whether they be happy
or painful memories,

699
01:12:14,229 --> 01:12:16,470
I'll cherish
every moment with you...

700
01:12:18,270 --> 01:12:20,670
as a beautiful memory.

701
01:12:24,449 --> 01:12:26,710
So don't worry about me anymore.

702
01:12:29,079 --> 01:12:30,149
It's...

703
01:12:31,819 --> 01:12:33,189
really quiet here.

704
01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:38,760
That's because
we're the only ones here.

705
01:12:40,890 --> 01:12:42,300
It's just us two.

706
01:12:46,069 --> 01:12:47,130
Then...

707
01:12:49,170 --> 01:12:50,640
this must be paradise.

708
01:13:02,779 --> 01:13:04,250
I'm really sleepy.

709
01:13:05,090 --> 01:13:06,119
Okay.

710
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:08,890
Sleep tight.

711
01:14:27,430 --> 01:14:29,239
(Cha Ji Won)

712
01:14:49,489 --> 01:14:51,560
Breathe.

713
01:14:51,689 --> 01:14:52,789
Breathe.

714
01:14:53,189 --> 01:14:55,029
It's already been four months.

715
01:14:55,630 --> 01:14:57,359
Say anything.

716
01:14:57,729 --> 01:14:59,270
Anything is fine.

717
01:14:59,829 --> 01:15:03,069
I want your dad to be happy.

718
01:15:03,439 --> 01:15:04,439
I want...

719
01:15:06,510 --> 01:15:08,340
your dad...

720
01:15:09,340 --> 01:15:11,779
to live freely for once.

721
01:15:13,449 --> 01:15:16,079
