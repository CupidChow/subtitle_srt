(This program includes

8
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:56,189
Can the bride give
a more natural smile?

9
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:57,329
Okay.

10
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:00,899
Sir, you look so handsome.

11
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,770
You could be a model.

12
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,010
Should we take a break?

13
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:10,209
Yes, I'm a bit tired.

14
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,650
I'm sorry, but could we take 10?

15
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:15,780
Shall we?

16
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,650
Sit down.

17
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,359
Are you sure this is
your first wedding photoshoot?

18
00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:31,030
Why are you so good at it?

19
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:34,469
Everything is about your stamina.

20
00:01:41,709 --> 00:01:42,739
What's wrong?

21
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:44,980
Do you have a worry?

22
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:48,849
Are your parents really not coming?

23
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,049
No. They won't.

24
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,219
It's a once-in-a-lifetime wedding.

25
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,859
I don't want you to regret...

26
00:01:57,859 --> 00:01:59,090
Then we can do it twice.

27
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:02,030
We'll do it again next time.

28
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,159
Are you going to brush it off
like that again?

29
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,169
Weddings are just a formality.

30
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:15,939
Don't think too much about it.

31
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:19,139
You're going to be sad
if your parents aren't there.

32
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:23,349
You are the only one I have.

33
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,520
I mean it.

34
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,030
Have you been well?

35
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:47,110
The last time we met
was two weeks ago, right?

36
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,110
At Lawyer Song's office.

37
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,310
Time flew by.

38
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,550
It's been four months already.

39
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:17,840
Hey!

40
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,539
Ho Joon.

41
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,120
He's alive.

42
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,030
He's breathing. He is.

43
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:44,960
- Stay still.
- He's breathing.

44
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,229
I'll call an ambulance.

45
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,080
He's still unconscious.

46
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:59,479
But his breathing and pulse
are good.

47
00:04:00,979 --> 00:04:02,150
What about Baek Hee Seong?

48
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,780
He died.

49
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,520
How bad is his injury?

50
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,819
By the looks of it,
the bullet missed it.

51
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:14,090
It didn't go through the brain.

52
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:15,759
I see.

53
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:18,029
I'll go straight to the hospital
once everything's settled here.

54
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:21,029
I know it'll be tough
but hang in there.

55
00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:51,259
The bullet grazed his head
and tore open his scalp.

56
00:04:51,529 --> 00:04:53,129
His skull is fractured.

57
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,230
It was a linear fracture.

58
00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:58,069
Simply put,
there's a fracture in his skull.

59
00:04:58,769 --> 00:05:00,769
This isn't a fatal injury, is it?

60
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:04,939
No. Judging by the CT scan,
there are no other injuries.

61
00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:07,350
We've treated him already
for any possible infections.

62
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,449
Then when will he wake up?

63
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,589
Right now, he's unconscious
due to a concussion.

64
00:05:15,019 --> 00:05:18,560
He'll regain consciousness
in a day or so.

65
00:05:31,569 --> 00:05:33,470
There are reporters outside.

66
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:35,269
How is he doing?

67
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:38,610
As long as there's no blood
stored in his brain, he'll be fine.

68
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:40,879
How's Ho Joon?

69
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,350
Captain Lee is taking care of him.

70
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:44,819
He's out of it.

71
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,889
He'll be interrogated
for an entire month.

72
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,889
There were no problems
during the shooting, were there?

73
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:54,959
Captain Lee will take care of that.
Just worry about yourself.

74
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:57,759
As soon as your husband wakes up,
a huge hardship will come your way.

75
00:05:58,259 --> 00:05:59,600
You better brace yourself.

76
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:03,899
It's okay.

77
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,310
We'll be able to overcome
any hardships if we're together.

78
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:09,439
Gosh.

79
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:12,379
Back then, I had no idea...

80
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,319
that I'd never get to see him again.

81
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,920
Say something.

82
00:06:26,089 --> 00:06:27,730
Anything will do.

83
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:35,370
Do I...

84
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,870
make you very uncomfortable?

85
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,420
You can be comfortable with me.

86
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:04,829
I hope you don't feel
too uncomfortable.

87
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:09,430
Hee Seong,

88
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,139
you and I can get to know each other
one step at a time.

89
00:07:17,209 --> 00:07:18,339
I'm Do Hyun Su.

90
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,610
Pardon?

91
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:24,319
You called me Hee Seong once again.

92
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,879
I apologize.

93
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:33,589
People say...

94
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:37,860
that I regained consciousness
after a month at the hospital.

95
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,600
But that's not how I feel.

96
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,639
Come here. Come give me a hug.

97
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,220
I hurt you.

98
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,290
I made you suffer.

99
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,569
I wish...

100
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:20,610
you could live as me
for just one day.

101
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:24,040
That way, you'd know how much
I love you.

102
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:29,579
Goodness. Was my husband
always this good-looking?

103
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,450
Call Detective Im.

104
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:35,519
That you have
more urgent matters to attend to.

105
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:38,419
Come on, cut it out.

106
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:43,429
I'm going to catch you. Come here!

107
00:08:59,809 --> 00:09:01,710
When I had woken up,

108
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:06,950
I thought I was hospitalized
due to a car accident.

109
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,590
I really thought...

110
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:16,490
it was still 2005.

111
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:19,100
Hey, Mom.

112
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:23,029
He has no brain damage,
and his vitals are stable as well.

113
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,600
I don't understand
why he's not waking up.

114
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:28,169
Okay. I'll stop by home later.

115
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,289
Honey.

116
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,570
(Public Official, Cha Ji Won)

117
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:32,269
What's wrong?

118
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,250
Honey!

119
00:11:01,929 --> 00:11:03,629
- It's Do Hyun Su!
- It's him!

120
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:05,440
- Mr. Do!
- It's you, right?

121
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,940
- Mr. Do!
- It's you, right?

122
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,909
- Are you all recovered?
- You were the one...

123
00:11:08,909 --> 00:11:10,409
who helped close
the Yeonju Serial Murder Case.

124
00:11:10,409 --> 00:11:13,440
Not only did I leap
15 years into the future,

125
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,149
but I had become very famous.

126
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:21,220
Since 2005,
Baek Hee Seong's parents,

127
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,549
Baek Man Woo and Gong Mi Ja,
made Do Hyun Su take...

128
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,460
their son's identity.

129
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,159
Through our inspection,
we've found out...

130
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:32,059
that Det. Cha Ji Won was
not involved in this whatsoever.

131
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:35,200
After she had found out
about this in May,

132
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:38,570
she persuaded him to help the police
with the investigation.

133
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:41,639
Thanks to his willingness to help,

134
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:43,940
the police were able
to speed up the investigation.

135
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:47,779
And as a result,
we could uncover the bodies...

136
00:11:48,049 --> 00:11:49,950
from the Yeonju Serial Murder Case.

137
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:55,750
Some people dub me a hero
who caught the Yeonju serial killer.

138
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,559
Others...

139
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:06,600
pity me for taking the blame
for my sister's crime...

140
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,570
and living in hiding.

141
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:12,039
Then there are those...

142
00:12:14,539 --> 00:12:16,240
who criticize me for taking
someone else's identity.

143
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,779
Since I've deceived
and used my wife,

144
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,320
they call me a psychopath.

145
00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:31,990
However,

146
00:12:35,059 --> 00:12:38,029
the sole individual
who should never forgive me...

147
00:12:41,299 --> 00:12:43,399
doesn't hate me one bit.

148
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,740
That's because...

149
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:50,169
you don't know about
our relationship.

150
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:51,740
What I want to say is...

151
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:58,179
accepting everything that's
happening around me right now...

152
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,450
is too hard to handle.

153
00:13:02,889 --> 00:13:04,019
So...

154
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,929
I can't say...

155
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,360
the words you want to hear.

156
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,340
There's nothing I want.

157
00:13:29,649 --> 00:13:30,679
But...

158
00:13:31,779 --> 00:13:33,320
there's something I'm curious about.

159
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,419
Yes. What is it?

160
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:41,860
Why...

161
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:44,759
do you...

162
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,629
still have that...

163
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,570
What?

164
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,279
Never mind.

165
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:01,809
I'm sorry.

166
00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:04,750
Since today is an important day
for you, Hee Seong...

167
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,019
I'm sorry.

168
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:13,519
I understand.

169
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,899
I came to root for you today,
Mr. Do.

170
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,610
But I'm afraid I made you
more uncomfortable.

171
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:37,149
I'm...

172
00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:42,250
not sure if I'll do okay.

173
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:44,990
You just have to do
as you practiced.

174
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:47,960
Okay.

175
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,600
Then...

176
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:24,129
(Witness Waiting Room)

177
00:15:24,129 --> 00:15:25,600
All rise.

178
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,909
Today's the first trial for
Ms. Do Hae Su,

179
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:44,480
who has been convicted for...

180
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,750
the Gagyeong-ri Village Foreman
Murder Case 18 years ago.

181
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,850
Today will be citizen
participation in the criminal trial.

182
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,960
The prosecution will accuse her
of murder...

183
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,789
while the defendant will claim
self-defense...

184
00:15:53,789 --> 00:15:55,929
in an intense trial today.

185
00:15:56,429 --> 00:15:59,730
Especially in today's trial,
the defendant has summoned...

186
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:03,429
Do Hyun Su, her brother and the man
who is the talk of the town...

187
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:05,539
as a witness, which has attracted
the public's interest.

188
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:14,179
I swear to state the truth,
the whole truth...

189
00:16:14,179 --> 00:16:15,909
and nothing but the truth
according to my conscience.

190
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:20,320
If I give a false statement,
I swear to be punished for perjury.

191
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,350
(Do Hyun Su)

192
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:29,090
Mr. Do, you were the first to arrive
at the scene after the incident.

193
00:16:29,129 --> 00:16:30,190
Is that right?

194
00:16:34,029 --> 00:16:35,129
Yes.

195
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:43,039
Did you do it?

196
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:44,879
I came to ask the foreman...

197
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:48,549
to stop making you do an exorcism.

198
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:51,179
I came to ask him that.

199
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,919
But he suddenly...

200
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,419
He suddenly...

201
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:02,830
I took the scissors from her hand...

202
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:09,299
and wiped her fingerprints
on my clothing.

203
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,769
You were fully aware
the incident was caused...

204
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:14,869
by the foreman Kwon Sung Bok's
violence...

205
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:17,710
toward the defendant.
Is that correct?

206
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,180
Yes.

207
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,980
But why didn't you ask for the help
of the judicial system?

208
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,089
I never thought of the
possibility...

209
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,789
that someone could help us.

210
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,630
After my father was found
as a serial murderer,

211
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,359
my sister and my trial...

212
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,569
was as good as over.

213
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,369
Was Ms. Do...

214
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,140
usually scared of
the foreman Kwon Sung Bok?

215
00:17:52,109 --> 00:17:54,650
Whenever I was dragged away
by Kwon Sung Bok,

216
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,549
she couldn't sleep all night...

217
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:04,619
and even threw up whatever she ate.

218
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:08,660
That will be all.

219
00:18:11,829 --> 00:18:13,829
Isn't Do Hyun Su doing better
than we expected?

220
00:18:14,869 --> 00:18:17,730
The jury seems like
they're almost persuaded.

221
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,500
Prosecution, begin your questioning.

222
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,740
He needs to answer correctly
to the prosecution.

223
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,509
I'm so curious.

224
00:18:26,609 --> 00:18:28,809
How do you think
Do Hae Su's trial will go?

225
00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:31,450
Since a weapon was used,

226
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:34,180
it'll be difficult to be found
as self-defense.

227
00:18:34,589 --> 00:18:37,420
The defense counsel's
strategy is to use...

228
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,390
the public's sympathy
for Do Hyun Su...

229
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:41,890
to receive a unanimous vote
from the jury.

230
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:43,460
But in other words,

231
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:46,329
this means that they have
no critical card...

232
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,930
for their claim of self-defense
to be accepted.

233
00:18:49,099 --> 00:18:52,700
Everyone in this village
is on the same side.

234
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:56,410
How could they all
say the same thing? Goodness.

235
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,450
Wait.

236
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:03,450
The same side?

237
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:09,019
(Witness Statements)

238
00:19:09,019 --> 00:19:12,289
In order to live a comfortable life,
you changed your identity...

239
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:14,730
and deceived those around you
for 15 years.

240
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:17,529
You even deceived your wife,
who was a detective...

241
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,430
without her knowing about it at all.

242
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,829
Is that correct?

243
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:33,480
Is that correct?

244
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:41,390
Yes.

245
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,329
How did you manage to lie...

246
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:51,960
so flawlessly?

247
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,769
You claim that you cannot feel...

248
00:19:56,769 --> 00:19:59,170
emotions like ordinary people.

249
00:20:00,069 --> 00:20:03,940
Do you not feel guilt then?

250
00:20:10,579 --> 00:20:11,849
I love you.

251
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,250
I...

252
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:17,960
love you, Ji Won.

253
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:24,759
Do you...

254
00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:26,660
love her?

255
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:29,930
No.

256
00:20:31,069 --> 00:20:34,539
I never thought that way
even for a moment.

257
00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:35,609
Witness?

258
00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:40,380
Witness? Answer me.

259
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,109
Do you not feel guilt?

260
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,509
Objection.

261
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:46,619
That will be all.

262
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,990
She emphasized to the jury...

263
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,559
that Hyun Su is good at lying.

264
00:20:56,259 --> 00:20:59,000
To make it seem like
all his statements are false.

265
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,039
Let's finish today's questioning.

266
00:21:06,369 --> 00:21:09,309
The next trial will be held
tomorrow at 10am.

267
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,269
Thank you.

268
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,250
Why did you do that?

269
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,380
That was an expected question.

270
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,279
You even practiced.

271
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:24,049
"I had no choice back then."

272
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:26,519
"I'm deeply regretting my actions."

273
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,789
How could you forget that?

274
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,299
What?

275
00:21:41,569 --> 00:21:42,869
It's because of her.

276
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:47,009
The moment we looked at each other,

277
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:50,509
my head turned blank.

278
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,470
(Jae Seop)

279
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:15,170
Hey, Jae Seop.

280
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:17,369
The trial just ended.

281
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:22,180
It's not going well.
We don't even have a proper witness.

282
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:26,680
Hey, can't you be more friendly
to Detective Cha? You jerk.

283
00:22:28,349 --> 00:22:30,220
I don't want her to get
her hopes up.

284
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:33,220
Hope? What hope?

285
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:34,789
I used her...

286
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:37,960
for 14 years just for my
personal interest.

287
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:41,329
I don't think she's accepting...

288
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:44,269
the fact that I'm such a scumbag.

289
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,240
It's better to keep a distance
from her.

290
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:49,210
Your feelings for her were real.

291
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:55,910
How do you know that?

292
00:22:56,849 --> 00:22:58,009
Because it seemed so.

293
00:23:02,289 --> 00:23:03,890
You were probably mistaken.

294
00:23:05,089 --> 00:23:06,460
How could I marry her...

295
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:09,759
as someone else
if I really loved her?

296
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:11,930
Hey, forget it.
Don't think too much.

297
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:16,130
Does Detective Cha concern you
at this very moment or not?

298
00:23:19,869 --> 00:23:22,240
- She makes me uncomfortable.
- Hey, it's Detective Cha.

299
00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:33,750
So you are concerned about her.

300
00:23:37,619 --> 00:23:38,819
What?

301
00:23:39,589 --> 00:23:41,319
Are you going to punch me or what?

302
00:23:41,829 --> 00:23:42,930
Let's just go.

303
00:23:45,029 --> 00:23:46,160
Hey, it's Detective Cha.

304
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,299
Do you take me for a fool?

305
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,240
But...

306
00:23:56,109 --> 00:23:57,970
Stop messing around with her.

307
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:04,950
Just thinking about it...

308
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:07,720
makes me feel frustrated.

309
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:16,630
Mr. Do. You need to go somewhere
with me.

310
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,369
We found a witness who can
turn the tables.

311
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,609
I was reviewing the
witness statements again.

312
00:24:28,809 --> 00:24:30,569
I found someone who could help us.

313
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:32,940
It's the foreman's nephew,
Yang Jin Tae.

314
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,750
He stated that the foreman used
Do Min Seok's money...

315
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,450
to pay for his exorcism.

316
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:39,349
Whenever they performed an exorcism,

317
00:24:39,349 --> 00:24:41,279
the money that was withdrawn
from Do Min Seok's bank account...

318
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,720
and the money paid to the
exorcist didn't match.

319
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,259
The money withdrawn from
Do Min Seok's bank account...

320
00:24:46,259 --> 00:24:48,119
was three to five times more.

321
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:52,130
The foreman used the exorcism
to take Do Min Seok's money.

322
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,829
And he purposely used Do Hyun Su
as a scapegoat.

323
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,970
Honey, do you know the foreman's
nephew, Yang Jin Tae?

324
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,539
He's...

325
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:08,549
I'm sorry.
I was just caught in the moment.

326
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:15,750
Yang Jin Tae?

327
00:25:16,049 --> 00:25:17,990
Yes. That university student.

328
00:25:18,289 --> 00:25:20,089
He came during summer break.

329
00:25:20,789 --> 00:25:23,390
He'll testify for us?

330
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,730
He hasn't said that yet.

331
00:25:25,099 --> 00:25:27,259
Detective Cha and Hyun Su
went to persuade him.

332
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,599
- Together?
- Yes.

333
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:32,339
How are they doing?

334
00:25:33,099 --> 00:25:35,269
Detective Cha is literally
a living saint.

335
00:25:35,769 --> 00:25:37,940
If it were me, I'd grab him
by the collar...

336
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:41,109
and ask how he could forget me
and throw him to the floor.

337
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:44,210
Detective Cha is being
super patient...

338
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:46,319
in order to win over
Hyun Su again...

339
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,920
I mean, she's waiting.

340
00:25:50,819 --> 00:25:53,359
What about Hyun Su?
Has he opened up yet?

341
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:57,329
Rather than that,
after he lost his memory,

342
00:25:57,329 --> 00:25:58,799
don't you think he's changed?

343
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,529
He's still the obnoxious guy I know,

344
00:26:02,369 --> 00:26:06,000
but it feels like he's been mixed
with someone else.

345
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,410
I sometimes think...

346
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:13,140
that he didn't change,
but maybe this could be...

347
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,180
Hyun Su's original self.

348
00:26:15,509 --> 00:26:19,349
I see. It's a horror movie for me,
but you see it as humanism?

349
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:22,019
You're his family, after all.

350
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:28,059
Isn't it uncomfortable
living with Hyun Su?

351
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:30,390
He thinks it's his home.

352
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:33,299
It's so uncomfortable.
He's making my life miserable.

353
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,470
Mu Jin, you don't have to visit me
often.

354
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:41,740
Why? I like visiting you.

355
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:45,309
I like chatting with you
the most in this world.

356
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,349
It's just a bit embarrassing.

357
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:50,210
Why?

358
00:26:50,849 --> 00:26:54,380
- I'm in prison clothes and all.
- You look great in it.

359
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,289
What?

360
00:26:57,319 --> 00:27:00,089
I mean, the color.

361
00:27:00,089 --> 00:27:02,190
That pastel tone fits you well.

362
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,329
I like chatting with you too.

363
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,210
I hope you, me, Hyun Su,

364
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:16,839
Ji Won, and Eun Ha...

365
00:27:17,539 --> 00:27:20,980
can gather at our house
and eat together.

366
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:45,400
We promised to meet here.

367
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,039
The phone is turned off. Please
leave a message after the beep.

368
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,380
His phone is turned off too.

369
00:27:55,579 --> 00:27:56,750
Is something wrong?

370
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,980
I'm sure he's trying to avoid you.

371
00:28:00,019 --> 00:28:01,220
He probably thought about it...

372
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:04,420
and decided not to testify.

373
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:07,960
I don't think so.
When we talked on the phone,

374
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,859
he said he wanted to talk about it.

375
00:28:15,369 --> 00:28:17,529
I'm sorry. I can't testify.

376
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:19,440
I'm sorry.

377
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:21,069
He...

378
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,339
won't testify.

379
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:28,650
- Let's go.
- Wait.

380
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:33,980
He's going to come home anyway.
Let's persuade him together.

381
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,769
Hey, it's raining.

382
00:29:25,539 --> 00:29:26,670
Do you like the rain?

383
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:30,730
Ji Won only believes what she sees.

384
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:38,269
That's why it's easy to use her.

385
00:30:55,230 --> 00:31:00,460
(Grandma)

386
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,500
- Eun Ha.
- Yes?

387
00:31:03,869 --> 00:31:06,769
Do you hate your dad?

388
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,670
No.

389
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,910
Then why didn't you draw him?

390
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,509
If I draw Dad,

391
00:31:15,009 --> 00:31:16,410
Mom cries.

392
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:19,619
If Mom cries,

393
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,049
I feel sorry for her.

394
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:24,119
My goodness.

395
00:31:25,589 --> 00:31:27,960
You're worried about your mom now.

396
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:31,430
Gosh, you're all grown up.

397
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:35,369
Dad is mean.

398
00:31:36,829 --> 00:31:38,569
He went on a vacation alone.

399
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:41,839
He should've brought me and Mom too.

400
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:56,390
It stopped raining. Let's go.

401
00:31:58,049 --> 00:32:00,819
I'll wait here, so you can go.

402
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:04,759
Detective Cha?

403
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:06,730
Yes.

404
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,569
I can wait on my own,
so you can go.

405
00:32:10,569 --> 00:32:11,630
Why...

406
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:14,140
aren't you taking that off?

407
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:17,769
- What?
- That ring.

408
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:28,279
I visit the workshop lately
to regain my touch,

409
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,390
and if I take this off,
my hand keeps slipping.

410
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:37,859
I'm sorry.

411
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,460
That was thoughtless of me.

412
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:42,730
I should've given it back to you.

413
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,099
Here.

414
00:32:50,809 --> 00:32:53,109
I'm fine. I can wear another ring.

415
00:32:53,809 --> 00:32:56,150
I'll find one in a similar size.

416
00:32:58,079 --> 00:32:59,180
Take it.

417
00:33:16,529 --> 00:33:17,869
Yang Jin Tae?

418
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:36,119
Did you do something wrong to me,

419
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:38,390
Mr. Yang?

420
00:33:39,619 --> 00:33:41,259
I'm sorry, Hyun Su.

421
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:45,059
Mr. Yang Jin Tae.

422
00:33:46,099 --> 00:33:47,160
Is that you?

423
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:54,470
We need your testimony,

424
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:56,369
Mr. Yang.

425
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:59,779
(Voice Recording)

426
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:02,549
I'll record this.

427
00:34:03,349 --> 00:34:04,450
Okay.

428
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,579
(Kwon Sung Bok's intention)

429
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:10,320
What was the foreman's intention?

430
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:13,760
At that time, a temporary guardian
for Hae Su and Hyun Su...

431
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,219
hadn't been assigned yet.

432
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:16,889
He was determined...

433
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:20,199
to sponge off
as much money as possible.

434
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:26,199
What have you done wrong to me...

435
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,170
to avoid me?

436
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:34,610
He promised to pay my tuition
if I helped him.

437
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:38,880
So I spread a rumor...

438
00:34:40,019 --> 00:34:41,750
about you.

439
00:34:43,989 --> 00:34:45,250
What was it?

440
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:49,630
I killed a chicken, cut it open,

441
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:51,260
and left it on the street.

442
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,059
The next day,
people gathered around it.

443
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,630
That's when I said
that Hyun Su had done it...

444
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:58,670
and that he was possessed
by his father's spirit.

445
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:00,570
I spread that rumor.

446
00:35:00,769 --> 00:35:02,769
You instilled fear
and provoked them...

447
00:35:03,139 --> 00:35:05,809
in order to carry out an exorcism.

448
00:35:08,579 --> 00:35:09,809
You're right.

449
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,550
I'd like you...

450
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:16,690
to testify this in court.

451
00:35:20,389 --> 00:35:23,190
I can make an anonymous report,
but testifying...

452
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,159
Hyun Su.

453
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,730
I'm truly sorry.
I know I should testify,

454
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:32,639
but I am
an elementary school teacher.

455
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,099
If word gets out,

456
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:38,610
I'll be done for.

457
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:41,980
I really can't do it.

458
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:46,219
(Refusal...)

459
00:35:47,949 --> 00:35:51,889
(Refusal to testify)

460
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:58,789
Mr. Yang.

461
00:36:00,829 --> 00:36:02,670
Listen to your heart...

462
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:05,500
before making this decision.

463
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:08,039
I hope...

464
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:11,809
you do what's best for you...

465
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,110
and not anyone else.

466
00:36:16,309 --> 00:36:18,050
That way you won't resent yourself.

467
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,219
And...

468
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:27,659
I will forgive you...

469
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:30,630
right now.

470
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:35,429
So...

471
00:36:37,469 --> 00:36:40,800
you can let go of your guilt.

472
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:50,280
Back there,

473
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,550
you said you forgave him.

474
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,820
That's not something easy to say.

475
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:02,489
It wasn't easy, was it?

476
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:06,929
No. It was.

477
00:37:07,699 --> 00:37:08,860
Pardon?

478
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:13,070
Because it's a lie.

479
00:37:14,539 --> 00:37:15,969
Forgiveness, my foot.

480
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:18,539
If I could've had it my way,

481
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:20,679
I would've twisted his neck
then and there.

482
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:27,920
I'm sorry.

483
00:37:29,889 --> 00:37:32,489
He seemed to feel immense guilt,

484
00:37:33,289 --> 00:37:36,130
so I thought I could win him over
by provoking him a bit.

485
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,510
See?

486
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,710
(Yang Jin Tae)

487
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,179
Hello?

488
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:02,489
Hyun Su, I'll testify.

489
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:05,289
I think I should.

490
00:38:06,889 --> 00:38:08,489
Okay, thank you.

491
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,760
My lawyer will call you tomorrow.

492
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:14,659
I'll see you then.

493
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,440
I should surprise everyone
during the final hearing...

494
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,269
by bringing him in then, right?

495
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,210
Detective Cha.

496
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:32,980
Put on a poker face, will you?

497
00:38:34,449 --> 00:38:37,820
I can see through you,
and it's embarrassing me.

498
00:38:40,289 --> 00:38:44,360
What do you think I'm thinking?

499
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,929
"He's not the person I once knew."

500
00:38:50,769 --> 00:38:52,639
"He's not the one
I was looking for."

501
00:38:57,369 --> 00:38:58,440
Am I wrong?

502
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:09,219
You're doing this on purpose,
aren't you?

503
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:13,519
Why are you being so harsh?

504
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,019
You see,

505
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,760
I can lie...

506
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:22,599
without feeling any guilt
or being emotionally stirred.

507
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,300
It seems like you don't know that.

508
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:35,409
Do you actually think
that you can tell...

509
00:39:35,409 --> 00:39:37,280
when I'm being sincere or not?

510
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:41,449
Hyun Su. Do Hyun Su.

511
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:53,900
That lunatic.

512
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,769
When I first woke up,

513
00:39:58,699 --> 00:40:00,269
I had no recent memories.

514
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:05,110
So it felt like I had woken up
after 15 years.

515
00:40:06,809 --> 00:40:08,809
But I was wrong.

516
00:40:10,949 --> 00:40:13,679
The past 15 years...

517
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:19,719
were embedded in my body.

518
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,829
I can cook dishes...

519
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:25,590
that I've neither seen nor eaten.

520
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,360
When I need to craft,

521
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,429
my hands become
fascinatingly dexterous.

522
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,239
And...

523
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:44,380
I can read other people's emotions
instinctively...

524
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:48,219
and know very well how to use it...

525
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,789
to my advantage.

526
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,730
That's why...

527
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:02,969
I know exactly what you want...

528
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:06,800
to hear from me.

529
00:41:08,969 --> 00:41:10,809
There's nothing I want to hear
from you.

530
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:15,739
No, there is.

531
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:19,619
I can see...

532
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:23,090
that you're desperate to hear it.

533
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:29,429
"I may have no memories of you,"

534
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:34,800
"but my feelings for you
are still the same."

535
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,440
That's what you want to hear.

536
00:41:49,849 --> 00:41:51,010
Don't be ridiculous.

537
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:56,619
I never wanted to hear that
from you.

538
00:42:10,829 --> 00:42:12,639
How could you forget me?

539
00:42:15,639 --> 00:42:17,010
How could you?

540
00:42:17,909 --> 00:42:19,440
How could you do that?

541
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:22,880
We loved each other so passionately.

542
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,510
Do you know how hard it was
to get this far?

543
00:42:27,019 --> 00:42:28,750
So how could I be...

544
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:33,190
the only one you don't remember?

545
00:42:36,989 --> 00:42:38,090
Detective Cha.

546
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,769
I question myself.

547
00:42:48,769 --> 00:42:51,369
I wonder if I can even be sincere.

548
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:55,780
I can't trust myself.

549
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:00,320
I have never been able...

550
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:05,719
to show unchanging emotions
to someone.

551
00:43:07,389 --> 00:43:08,559
So...

552
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:14,800
how long do you think
these feelings for you...

553
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:16,900
will last?

554
00:43:21,539 --> 00:43:23,670
Why do you doubt yourself?

555
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:31,250
Do you know what you're doing?

556
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:34,280
You're searching...

557
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:38,190
for that person in me.

558
00:43:41,489 --> 00:43:43,690
You get your hopes up
when you find a similarity...

559
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:47,599
and become disappointed
when you spot a difference.

560
00:43:50,869 --> 00:43:52,070
But you know what?

561
00:43:55,639 --> 00:43:57,039
I don't like him.

562
00:43:59,309 --> 00:44:01,039
I don't want
to get to know him one bit.

563
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,389
It feels like...

564
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:19,829
we're sharing a pair of shackles...

565
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,230
and running around in circles.

566
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:30,469
You're chasing me from behind.

567
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:35,179
And I'm running away from you...

568
00:44:37,349 --> 00:44:39,550
so that you won't see my face.

569
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:46,690
In the end,

570
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:52,630
neither of us
can take a step forward.

571
00:45:20,389 --> 00:45:22,360
("The Other Side
of the Yeonju Serial Murder Case")

572
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:24,760
(In a corner,
a big sack was moving.)

573
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:27,500
(I regret it. I regret the decision
I had made back then.)

574
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,099
(Hunter: This is only an excuse
he's making...)

575
00:45:33,099 --> 00:45:34,769
(after Do Hyun Su caught
the serial killer.)

576
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:41,380
(Bluemon: Show us the video.)

577
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:47,780
Hey, are you insane?

578
00:45:49,019 --> 00:45:50,150
What do you mean?

579
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:52,250
Come here.

580
00:45:58,929 --> 00:46:00,630
Do you know how terrified I was?

581
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,099
They're for you.

582
00:46:04,099 --> 00:46:06,570
Just looking at them
is making me nauseous.

583
00:46:07,099 --> 00:46:09,039
Why do you keep buying food
that you don't eat?

584
00:46:11,809 --> 00:46:15,409
I can't help but want to buy them.

585
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:20,679
That's an illness, you know?

586
00:46:24,619 --> 00:46:26,860
Wait, did you cry?

587
00:46:29,989 --> 00:46:32,230
No. Why would I?

588
00:46:35,699 --> 00:46:36,800
What's wrong?

589
00:46:37,769 --> 00:46:40,340
Did Yang Jin Tae refuse to testify?

590
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:45,110
No, he's going to do it.

591
00:46:45,639 --> 00:46:47,710
Really? That's great, then.

592
00:46:49,909 --> 00:46:51,280
But why do you look down?

593
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:55,320
Detective Cha finally gave you
a beating, didn't she?

594
00:46:59,619 --> 00:47:01,420
I wish she did.

595
00:47:04,429 --> 00:47:05,829
Once the hearing is over,

596
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:08,230
we'll have to discuss
the matter regarding our daughter.

597
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:12,030
Just thinking
about meeting her again...

598
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:15,639
makes me feel suffocated.

599
00:47:17,269 --> 00:47:19,110
Are you going to see Eun Ha?

600
00:47:20,909 --> 00:47:22,010
No.

601
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:25,309
I don't want her to.

602
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,750
Why should she meet her dad...

603
00:47:30,849 --> 00:47:32,090
when he can't even remember her?

604
00:47:32,690 --> 00:47:35,119
So what are you going to do now?

605
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,130
Mu Jin.

606
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:49,300
We still need to discuss
our share of the inheritance.

607
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:53,610
If I say that I want
to give everything to Eun Ha...

608
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:56,380
If I say...

609
00:48:01,019 --> 00:48:02,750
that I want to settle everything
then and there,

610
00:48:06,789 --> 00:48:07,889
do you think...

611
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:11,929
she'll be heartbroken?

612
00:48:57,139 --> 00:48:59,369
(Kwon Sung Bok's intention,
Yang Jin Tae's role)

613
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:01,809
(Fake rumor, refusal to testify)

614
00:49:03,809 --> 00:49:05,579
I killed a chicken, cut it open,

615
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:07,380
and left it on the street.

616
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:09,179
The next day,
people gathered around it.

617
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:10,849
Mr. Yang.

618
00:49:11,719 --> 00:49:13,289
Listen to your heart...

619
00:49:14,489 --> 00:49:16,429
before making this decision.

620
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:19,059
I hope...

621
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:24,570
you do what's best for you
and not anyone else.

622
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:28,869
That way you won't resent yourself.

623
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:40,920
Mom.

624
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:45,150
- Yes?
- Did you...

625
00:49:46,719 --> 00:49:47,820
and Dad...

626
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:50,860
get a divorce?

627
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:53,460
What?

628
00:49:54,059 --> 00:49:55,360
I told my friends...

629
00:49:57,670 --> 00:49:59,530
to call me Cha Eun Ha from now on,

630
00:50:01,739 --> 00:50:02,940
and they said...

631
00:50:04,139 --> 00:50:06,239
it meant that you two got a divorce.

632
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:09,280
That's not true.

633
00:50:09,909 --> 00:50:11,909
Then why isn't he coming home?

634
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:16,619
Come here.

635
00:50:24,829 --> 00:50:25,929
I want...

636
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,030
your dad to be happy.

637
00:50:33,769 --> 00:50:34,869
What about you?

638
00:50:35,869 --> 00:50:37,139
Me too.

639
00:50:41,239 --> 00:50:42,380
Your dad...

640
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:47,280
has never lived as himself.

641
00:50:51,389 --> 00:50:52,389
I want...

642
00:50:54,389 --> 00:50:56,389
your dad...

643
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:01,500
to live freely for once.

644
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:16,510
I heard you helped out a lot.

645
00:51:17,579 --> 00:51:18,780
Thank you.

646
00:51:20,449 --> 00:51:21,849
I don't deserve...

647
00:51:22,949 --> 00:51:24,989
to be grateful or apologetic...

648
00:51:25,889 --> 00:51:27,760
toward you.

649
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:31,230
You had made a huge sacrifice
because of me.

650
00:51:32,429 --> 00:51:33,900
At that time,

651
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,170
I wanted to protect
you and Eun Ha...

652
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:40,300
at all costs.

653
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:43,710
Because of that,

654
00:51:44,369 --> 00:51:46,940
I've started to like myself
a little more.

655
00:51:51,849 --> 00:51:53,420
I know it's hard...

656
00:51:54,449 --> 00:51:56,050
because of Hyun Su.

657
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:02,119
I'm going to let him go.

658
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:06,730
I've realized that's
the right thing to do...

659
00:52:08,829 --> 00:52:10,469
for him, as well as me.

660
00:52:11,929 --> 00:52:14,000
I've realized it too late.

661
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:22,039
After meeting you,

662
00:52:22,579 --> 00:52:24,380
there's something
I started to believe.

663
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:28,780
The pain we're experiencing now...

664
00:52:29,889 --> 00:52:33,659
is just a process we go through
to accept more things later.

665
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,230
I really hope...

666
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:40,800
you don't suffer too much.

667
00:52:46,429 --> 00:52:49,099
The jury has come to
a unanimous decision.

668
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,909
I'll read it out loud.

669
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:54,210
"Considering the circumstances
of the incident..."

670
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:56,239
"and the unusual environment
the defendant lived in,"

671
00:52:56,809 --> 00:52:59,309
"the defendant's behavior
can be generally accepted..."

672
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:01,349
"as the social norm."

673
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:05,550
"Therefore, we have reached
a unanimous decision."

674
00:53:06,519 --> 00:53:08,960
"The defendant, Do Hae Su's
behavior..."

675
00:53:09,489 --> 00:53:11,460
"is accepted as self-defense."

676
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,760
Before I announce the sentence,
I'd like to remind you...

677
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,130
that the justice department's
decision...

678
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:18,800
does not bind the jury's verdict.

679
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:21,469
I will announce the sentence.

680
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:23,099
The justice department's
decision...

681
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:25,170
was different from
the jury's verdict.

682
00:53:25,469 --> 00:53:27,340
Although they didn't accept
self-defense...

683
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:29,980
for Do Hae Su, who was
convicted for murder,

684
00:53:30,349 --> 00:53:32,610
considering the fact that
she was a minor...

685
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,079
and that the incident
occurred at night,

686
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:37,550
they overturned their
previous ruling...

687
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,289
and declared her as innocent.

688
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:40,559
Yes!

689
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,559
- Yes!
- Quiet down.

690
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:46,059
I'm sorry. Man, I knew it!

691
00:53:46,059 --> 00:53:47,599
I knew we'd win.

692
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:51,829
Why are you here?

693
00:53:54,369 --> 00:53:57,309
I guess it's really true
you lost your memory.

694
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:00,380
If you remembered me,

695
00:54:01,139 --> 00:54:03,480
you would've never come here.

696
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:09,119
I thought you would know...

697
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:12,750
the most about me.

698
00:54:19,389 --> 00:54:20,460
Did you...

699
00:54:22,329 --> 00:54:24,500
go see that person too?

700
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:43,280
Mr. Baek Man Woo?

701
00:54:51,530 --> 00:54:52,630
Hee Seong.

702
00:55:00,139 --> 00:55:01,639
Why did you come so late?

703
00:55:02,739 --> 00:55:04,739
Do you know how much
I waited for you?

704
00:55:06,039 --> 00:55:09,610
Dad. Did you wait for me?

705
00:55:10,809 --> 00:55:14,449
Yes. I waited every single day.

706
00:55:15,550 --> 00:55:17,750
I missed you too.

707
00:55:18,989 --> 00:55:20,360
Why are you so handsome?

708
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:24,659
Were you always this handsome?

709
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:40,280
I saved these just for you.

710
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:42,940
Eat them alone.

711
00:55:44,179 --> 00:55:45,949
Don't worry about that.

712
00:55:47,349 --> 00:55:49,750
He's falling deeper into the past,

713
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:53,989
escaping from reality.

714
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:05,429
So, what do you want to ask me?

715
00:56:08,570 --> 00:56:10,170
Detective Cha Ji Won.

716
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:14,380
What kind of...

717
00:56:16,849 --> 00:56:19,380
person was she to me?

718
00:56:26,019 --> 00:56:29,119
You hated showing us your wife.

719
00:56:31,829 --> 00:56:35,059
At first, we thought you were
being careful...

720
00:56:35,059 --> 00:56:36,730
in case she found out your secret.

721
00:56:37,469 --> 00:56:39,170
That's what we thought.

722
00:56:41,469 --> 00:56:42,599
But later,

723
00:56:44,510 --> 00:56:46,309
we realized that...

724
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:53,079
you...

725
00:56:55,449 --> 00:56:56,920
cared for her deeply.

726
00:57:02,889 --> 00:57:04,690
You should go. I'm tired.

727
00:57:07,329 --> 00:57:08,630
My visit is over.

728
00:57:55,309 --> 00:57:56,409
Studying overseas?

729
00:57:58,909 --> 00:58:00,349
I have never...

730
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:03,150
lived my own life.

731
00:58:03,849 --> 00:58:05,219
But...

732
00:58:05,849 --> 00:58:08,420
do you really have to go so far
to find your life?

733
00:58:09,159 --> 00:58:12,159
Seoul, Daejeon, Daegu, and Busan.

734
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:14,260
Do you know how big our country is?

735
00:58:16,969 --> 00:58:18,300
When I was a high school senior,

736
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:21,639
I saw Gaudi architecture on TV
by coincidence...

737
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:25,440
and my heart began to race
like crazy.

738
00:58:27,809 --> 00:58:29,710
I remembered how I felt back then.

739
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:33,579
I want to start over from there.

740
00:58:34,349 --> 00:58:35,820
I'm glad.

741
00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:40,289
Since you finally found
what you want.

742
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:45,030
I'll cheer for you.

743
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:50,300
I don't know how important
Gaudi is in your life,

744
00:58:51,269 --> 00:58:52,769
but I'm always on your side.

745
00:58:53,739 --> 00:58:54,840
Thank you.

746
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,269
Don't get your hopes up though.
I won't wait for you.

747
00:59:08,349 --> 00:59:11,219
Oh, right.
I forgot I had an interview.

748
00:59:12,349 --> 00:59:13,960
Look how late it is.

749
00:59:15,659 --> 00:59:17,730
I better get going.

750
00:59:18,329 --> 00:59:20,829
Hae Su, I'll see you
before you leave.

751
00:59:22,530 --> 00:59:23,630
See you guys.

752
00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:35,710
Hyun Su.

753
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:37,579
What?

754
00:59:45,389 --> 00:59:46,489
Okay.

755
01:00:17,019 --> 01:00:20,789
Hey. Are you here to comfort me
or what?

756
01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:50,349
Shall I wait for Hae Su?

757
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:56,659
Do as you please.

758
01:01:00,530 --> 01:01:01,659
No.

759
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:04,800
I'll forget everything.

760
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:08,840
I'll just forget about everything.

761
01:01:12,769 --> 01:01:16,179
How do you catch amnesia?

762
01:01:17,309 --> 01:01:18,809
You must be familiar with it.

763
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:24,550
In order to forget, your head...

764
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:26,250
has to be cracked.

765
01:01:27,159 --> 01:01:28,260
What?

766
01:01:28,889 --> 01:01:29,989
Shall I crack it for you?

767
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:57,449
Hey, Hae Su.
What's up at this hour?

768
01:01:58,920 --> 01:01:59,989
What?

769
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:04,590
Oh, right. We promised to talk
on the phone today.

770
01:02:05,389 --> 01:02:08,300
I'm so busy lately, so I forgot.

771
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:11,429
What is it? Are you upset?

772
01:02:13,570 --> 01:02:14,670
Really?

773
01:02:17,409 --> 01:02:18,809
Is it still morning over there?

774
01:02:19,309 --> 01:02:20,340
What did you eat?

775
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:23,079
Isn't it too greasy?

776
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:24,710
Shall I send some kimchi?

777
01:02:25,909 --> 01:02:27,219
You already have some?

778
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:30,949
I was about to send some
if you wanted.

779
01:02:37,130 --> 01:02:38,230
Hyun Su.

780
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:41,559
We are...

781
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:45,730
people who lost ourselves somewhere.

782
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:49,840
So we'll roam and wander about.

783
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:54,840
That's why we need
a new starting point.

784
01:02:55,539 --> 01:02:57,010
In order not to get lost.

785
01:03:06,989 --> 01:03:08,460
You're not even here now.

786
01:03:10,889 --> 01:03:12,429
Who can I ask for answers?

787
01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:18,000
The only person who knows
that answer...

788
01:03:20,469 --> 01:03:22,300
in this world is you.

789
01:04:17,389 --> 01:04:19,329
I'm so unlucky.

790
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,630
How can our first date go like this?

791
01:04:25,869 --> 01:04:27,030
Could you be...

792
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:30,000
the only one who doesn't know...

793
01:04:31,539 --> 01:04:32,840
that you like me?

794
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:17,219
(Real Estate)

795
01:05:19,690 --> 01:05:22,889
I found a perfect place
that fits your requirements.

796
01:05:27,829 --> 01:05:30,159
(Where the Morning Star Hovers)

797
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:37,739
(Where the Morning Star Hovers)

798
01:05:41,110 --> 01:05:43,809
Hello. You came to the right place.

799
01:05:44,710 --> 01:05:46,510
It's this place. Let's go inside.

800
01:05:52,219 --> 01:05:55,659
What do you think?
I was so surprised too.

801
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:00,230
The mood around the neighborhood
and the structure of the interior.

802
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:03,030
It fits your requirements perfectly.

803
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,670
Can I take a look around alone?

804
01:06:08,239 --> 01:06:10,539
Take your time and call me then.

805
01:06:10,539 --> 01:06:12,670
I'll tell the tenant you're here.

806
01:06:13,010 --> 01:06:14,110
Okay.

807
01:06:44,070 --> 01:06:49,780
(Where the Morning Star Hovers)

808
01:07:04,829 --> 01:07:08,429
(She hates moths extremely.)

809
01:07:08,429 --> 01:07:12,030
(Why does she hate moths
when she likes butterflies?)

812
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:22,679
(She likes the rain.)

813
01:07:23,679 --> 01:07:24,880
"She likes the rain."

01:07:26,409 --> 01:07:28,920
"When it rains,
her voice gets louder..."

815
01:07:29,820 --> 01:07:31,690
"and she laughs at almost anything."

816

"Does she like the cool
feeling of rain?"

817
01:07:37,059 --> 01:07:41,329
"Or does she like the sound of rain
that muffles loud noises?"

818
01:07:44,570 --> 01:07:46,670
Wait, don't look at that.

819
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:59,250
I was cleaning out the workshop.

820
01:08:01,079 --> 01:08:03,280
If there's anything you need,
you can take it.

821
01:08:04,650 --> 01:08:06,489
They were all yours anyway.

822
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:11,789
That notebook is yours too,

823
01:08:12,789 --> 01:08:16,100
but it's all about me,
so I can't give it to you.

(Where the Morning Star Hovers,
Baek Hee Seong)

825
01:08:27,439 --> 01:08:30,810
Did I name this workshop...

826
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:34,319
myself?

827
01:08:35,779 --> 01:08:36,920
Yes.

828
01:08:39,590 --> 01:08:40,960
Do you know what it means?

829
01:08:42,390 --> 01:08:44,760
You never told me,
no matter how much I asked.

830
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:53,569
Come to think of it,
no one will know now.

831
01:08:56,770 --> 01:08:58,270
Among the Greek and Roman Myths,

832
01:09:00,039 --> 01:09:02,779
there was a deity named
Hephaistos, who was a blacksmith.

833
01:09:04,510 --> 01:09:07,350
He was the ugliest deity in Olympus,

834
01:09:09,220 --> 01:09:10,619
and due to his foul temper,

835
01:09:12,289 --> 01:09:14,359
everyone hated him.

836
01:09:15,289 --> 01:09:19,560
So he stayed cooped up
in his workshop all day long.

837
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:24,600
But he had...

838
01:09:25,899 --> 01:09:28,170
a wife whom he dearly loved.

839
01:09:32,340 --> 01:09:33,739
Her name was Venus,

840
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:36,710
the morning star.

841
01:09:40,579 --> 01:09:43,880
"Morning star" was
another name for Venus.

842
01:10:11,279 --> 01:10:12,409
I...

843
01:10:13,609 --> 01:10:16,149
always thought of you...

844
01:10:18,319 --> 01:10:20,850
in the space where
I spent the most time.

845
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:28,760
I requested to be transferred
to the Busan TF Team.

846
01:10:30,529 --> 01:10:33,170
They need more manpower
over there,

847
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:35,039
so it'll be decided soon.

848
01:10:35,539 --> 01:10:36,699
So...

849
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:41,239
Are you saying...

850
01:10:43,409 --> 01:10:44,649
that you're leaving?

851
01:10:50,819 --> 01:10:52,489
I'm going to start over...

852
01:10:53,689 --> 01:10:55,420
at a new place too.

853
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:01,829
In order not to see you,
even by coincidence.

854
01:11:20,750 --> 01:11:21,949
How...

855
01:11:27,090 --> 01:11:28,460
I've finally taken...

856
01:11:29,489 --> 01:11:31,689
one step toward you.

857
01:11:35,359 --> 01:11:37,600
How could you run away from me?

858
01:11:38,770 --> 01:11:40,800
Hoping and getting disappointed...

859
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:44,869
and hoping and getting disappointed
again.

860
01:11:46,470 --> 01:11:48,010
I can't take it anymore.

861
01:11:51,579 --> 01:11:52,680
Can't you...

862
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:56,380
change your mind?

863
01:12:13,369 --> 01:12:15,199
I'll be really good to you.

864
01:12:17,710 --> 01:12:19,270
I'll sincerely like you.

865
01:12:24,609 --> 01:12:26,680
I'll like you a lot from now on.

866
01:12:27,850 --> 01:12:29,479
I'll be really good to you.

867
01:12:34,090 --> 01:12:35,819
The person you're looking for...

868
01:12:37,829 --> 01:12:39,390
Let me find him with you.

869
01:12:40,930 --> 01:12:42,229
I'm curious...

870
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:45,869
about that person too.

871
01:12:48,970 --> 01:12:50,199
I want to know about him.

872
01:12:59,909 --> 01:13:02,920
What's wrong with your hand?

873
01:13:06,489 --> 01:13:10,060
I keep getting hurt
every time I take off the ring.

874
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,199
It still feels awkward.

875
01:13:54,539 --> 01:13:56,199
I get strangely nervous...

876
01:13:58,970 --> 01:14:00,569
every time I stand in front of you.

877
01:14:05,979 --> 01:14:07,350
In case I make a mistake.

878
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:10,180
I'm scared too.

879
01:14:15,119 --> 01:14:16,220
Me too.

880
01:15:33,829 --> 01:15:35,800
I have to go pick up Eun Ha.

881
01:15:36,369 --> 01:15:37,640
Do you want to go with me?

882
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:42,680
Do you think she'll like me?

883
01:15:47,010 --> 01:15:48,119
Why are you laughing?

884
01:15:48,479 --> 01:15:50,850
What about you?
Why are you laughing?

885
01:15:53,050 --> 01:15:55,920
Because you are laughing.

886
01:16:19,380 --> 01:16:20,579
Dad!

887
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:28,989
Dad!

888
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:44,609
Dad! I missed you so, so, much.

889
01:16:53,149 --> 01:16:55,750
Dad, did you bring my gift?

890
01:16:57,220 --> 01:16:58,420
What?

891
01:17:01,859 --> 01:17:04,689
I'm sorry. I forgot.

892
01:17:05,630 --> 01:17:09,060
It's okay. You are my gift.

893
01:17:10,260 --> 01:17:13,600
I like you the most
in the whole wide world.

894
01:17:18,239 --> 01:17:19,270
Me...

895
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:22,939
Me too.

896
01:18:00,510 --> 01:18:04,890
(Flower of Evil)

897
01:19:11,079 --> 01:19:13,750
(Thank you for watching
"Flower of Evil".)
