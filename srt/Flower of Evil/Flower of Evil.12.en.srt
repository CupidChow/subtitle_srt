(Flower of Evil)

00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,479
(I'm going to bed first.
Make sure to take your medicine!)

5
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,350
(I'm going to bed first.
Make sure to take your medicine!)

6
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,180
Baek Hee Seong.

7
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,620
Mom.

8
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,449
Why are you home?

9
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,960
What are you doing right now?

10
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,659
This wasn't my fault.

11
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,930
He suddenly jumped
in front of my car.

12
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:19,000
Dad won't pick up his phone.

13
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:22,169
So?

14
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:24,240
Are you...

15
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:26,509
trying...

16
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,449
to bury a person...

17
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,150
here?

18
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,189
What else can I do?

19
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:38,960
What?

20
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,000
Mom.

21
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,740
Did you go through my room?

22
00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:10,490
Let's talk later.

23
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,629
You should go inside first...

24
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:15,560
instead of getting wet in the rain.

25
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:12,519
Hee Seong.

26
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,120
I'm scared.

27
00:05:15,589 --> 00:05:16,649
I'm so scared.

28
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,759
I can't handle it.

29
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,240
This is why...

30
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:42,279
you shouldn't have been home.

31
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,100
Everyone has secrets.

32
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,740
(Episode 12)

33
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,939
And...

34
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,910
there are people
who know those secrets.

35
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:19,750
And there are those
who want to find them out.

36
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,189
One...

37
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,259
Two...

38
00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:39,839
Do I need to count you as well?

39
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,319
Ma'am.

40
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:57,290
Are you sure you can't read lips?

41
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:08,699
If you keep avoiding my eyes
when I'm speaking,

42
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,069
I'm going to be upset.

43
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,819
Have you ever...

44
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:29,720
told others...

45
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:31,920
about my family?

46
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,579
No.

47
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:52,480
There's no one to tell either.

48
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,019
I can trust you, right?

49
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,699
I found this in Hee Seong's car.

50
00:08:44,129 --> 00:08:47,730
(Incoming Call)

51
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:54,940
- Hello?
- Have you gone insane?

52
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,110
Where's the money?

53
00:08:56,909 --> 00:08:58,039
Who is this?

54
00:09:00,809 --> 00:09:01,950
You're not Baek Hee Seong.

55
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:05,179
Hee Seong can't pick up the phone
right now.

56
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:09,889
I'm his father.
Whom am I speaking to?

57
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,289
Your son owes me money.

58
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:21,500
I met him one time
to hand over some money.

59
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:23,299
What money?

60
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,769
Hee Seong had asked him
to find someone for him.

61
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:31,240
Don't tell me it was Do Hae Su.

62
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:32,779
Perhaps.

63
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:41,190
Does that guy, Yeom Sang Chul,
know Hee Seong's condition?

64
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:46,019
He doesn't. I lied and said
that he's studying abroad.

65
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:47,590
So?

66
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:51,230
You told him to get rid of Hyun Su?

67
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,269
Are you out of your mind?

68
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,830
Do Hyun Su...

69
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,940
is poking around.

70
00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:02,769
We're all going down
if we stay still.

71
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,379
What do you expect?

72
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:05,840
Still...

73
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,309
There's no middle ground here.

74
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:12,620
Either he lives or we do.

75
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,820
It's one or the other.

76
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,779
- Are you here alone?
- Why do you ask?

77
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,279
Do you think you two can subdue me?

78
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,750
What?

79
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,620
I'm here to escort
the mighty Do Hyun Su.

80
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:54,490
Perhaps, I should've brought
the special forces.

81
00:10:54,629 --> 00:10:55,759
Jae Seop.

82
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,769
I'd like a cup of coffee.

83
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:37,100
Mr. Do Hyun Su,
you're the one who informed us.

84
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:42,440
First, I'd like to say thank you.

85
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,679
Thank you for the tip-off.

86
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:48,549
I know it wasn't easy.

87
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,809
Thanks to you,

88
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:53,049
we could apprehend
Yeom Sang Chul and his men.

89
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:58,620
Did you receive information
on Do Min Seok's accomplice?

90
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:02,429
No.

91
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:05,600
Yeom Sang Chul found out
that I had been wiretapping him,

92
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:07,059
so things went haywire.

93
00:12:08,429 --> 00:12:12,139
I'm afraid you'll have
to interrogate him yourself.

94
00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:25,950
Now, I'd like to ask you a question
as a detective...

95
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:29,990
to Do Hyun Su, a wanted criminal.

96
00:12:34,059 --> 00:12:35,190
Do Hyun Su.

97
00:12:37,629 --> 00:12:40,259
Why did you kill Kwon Sung Bok,
the village foreman...

98
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,029
of Gagyeong-ri?

99
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:49,470
Are you positive?

100
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:53,309
Are you sure Detective Cha
found out about everything?

101
00:12:58,419 --> 00:13:00,120
Detective... Detective Cha.

102
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,320
He's gone.

103
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:07,529
Pardon?

104
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:10,389
Do Hyun Su has left.

105
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,940
(Detective Cha Ji Won)

106
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:24,610
What are you planning to do?

107
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:26,580
- Give that back.
- No, I can't.

108
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:33,120
Where are you going?
What are you going to do?

109
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:34,590
I'm going to turn myself in.

110
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,860
There must've been
a motive for murder.

111
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:40,519
What was it?

112
00:13:41,629 --> 00:13:42,860
- There wasn't one.
- It wasn't him.

113
00:13:46,429 --> 00:13:47,529
What is this?

114
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,169
Did you two not plan this through?

115
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,409
There was no motive.

116
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:05,549
On August 30, 2002, at 7am,

117
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,220
Kwon Sung Bok, the village foreman
of Gagyeong-ri...

118
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,490
was found dead in his own
farming tool storage.

119
00:14:11,259 --> 00:14:12,789
He was fatally wounded...

120
00:14:12,789 --> 00:14:14,730
when his carotid got cut off
by a weapon.

121
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,159
The cause of death
was excessive bleeding.

122
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:18,159
There were traces
of physical struggle.

123
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:21,600
A button from...

124
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,370
a Sejin High School male uniform
was found near the body.

125
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:28,610
Move aside. I said, move.

126
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:33,279
First, let's calm down, okay?
Hae Su, please.

127
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,379
Who are you to stop me...

128
00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:38,480
when I'm trying to own up
for what I've done?

129
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,779
This is between Hyun Su
and Detective Cha.

130
00:14:41,049 --> 00:14:42,690
You won't be able to solve anything.

131
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,820
If you were doing this...

132
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:47,889
because you felt guilty
for what you had done,

133
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,029
then I wouldn't have stopped you.

134
00:14:51,529 --> 00:14:53,330
Did you just say, "Guilty"?

135
00:14:55,169 --> 00:14:56,269
Why should I be?

136
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:59,039
Don't you know
what he did to Hyun Su?

137
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,710
Come here! I said come here!

138
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,710
Move! We've brought him!

139
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:05,779
Come here!

140
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:08,009
He dragged Hyun Su to an exorcism
nearly every day.

141
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:11,019
He claimed that our father's spirit
possessed Hyun Su...

142
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:14,019
and called over
all the infuriated townspeople.

143
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,919
He made them express their anger
toward Hyun Su.

144
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,889
He was merely 18.

145
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:26,529
In the end, Hyun Su believed...

146
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:28,970
that he was possessed.

147
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,870
Hyun Su, what's wrong?

148
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:39,379
Hyun Su.

149
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:42,049
- Hae Su.
- Yes?

150
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,679
I can see Father.

151
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,080
What?

152
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,419
He's standing over there,
talking to me.

153
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:01,399
Hyun Su.

154
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:05,039
You're wrong. No one's here.

155
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,669
The village foreman was right.

156
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,610
I'll eventually end up like Father.

157
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,049
Kim Mu Jin.

158
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:22,750
You're the same.

159
00:16:23,889 --> 00:16:25,190
You're just like everyone else.

160
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,029
You eventually turned your back
on Hyun Su...

161
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:30,029
and became like everyone else.

162
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,629
In that village that was
destroyed by the devil Do Min Seok,

163
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,070
there was not one person
who didn't do Hyun Su wrong.

164
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:42,940
I know.

165
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:45,679
You're right.

166
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:48,080
When everyone turned into monsters,

167
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,450
Hyun Su was the only one
who stayed human.

168
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:56,350
The prime suspect, Do Hyun Su,

169
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:58,559
ran away on the night of the murder.

170
00:16:59,389 --> 00:17:02,389
He burned his house down and got
rid of all fingerprints, photos,

171
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,400
and any other evidence.

172
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:07,559
And he was only 18 years old.

173
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:11,170
However,

174
00:17:12,269 --> 00:17:15,039
why did he leave the weapon
near a brook...

175
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,509
where it could be easily seen?

176
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,380
On top of that,

177
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,450
it was inside a backpack
full of textbooks...

178
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,509
that had Do Hyun Su's name
clearly written on it.

179
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:25,950
As if he wanted it to be found.

180
00:17:35,059 --> 00:17:38,299
I also found something interesting
from the witness' statements.

181
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:43,200
Everyone agreed that Do Hyun Su was
fully capable of doing it,

182
00:17:43,569 --> 00:17:44,839
but there was one person...

183
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:47,700
who said he was not
someone who would do that.

184
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:49,670
That person is...

185
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,339
I killed him.

186
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,019
I...

187
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,920
killed him.

188
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:26,339
Thank you for the coffee.

189
00:18:28,579 --> 00:18:30,309
Mr. Baek Hee Seong.

190
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:42,289
This is for the coffee.

191
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:03,279
Jae Seop.

192
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:10,650
You're just leaving?

193
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:13,319
Why? Do you want to cook me
breakfast too?

194
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,059
Why is it?

195
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:19,259
The reason you're just leaving
like this.

196
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:21,599
Tell me why.

197
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:26,369
I'm not stupid.

198
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,609
You say Do Hyun Su is innocent,

199
00:19:29,609 --> 00:19:31,710
but you're not trying hard
to get involved.

200
00:19:33,009 --> 00:19:34,240
I have a gut feeling.

201
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:38,549
The tragedy of young siblings
where the whole world...

202
00:19:38,849 --> 00:19:40,549
turned on them overnight.

203
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,859
I don't want to get involved
just like you.

204
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,559
That's all.

205
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:52,029
See you.

206
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:26,059
What will happen to us?

207
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,500
I don't know what Detective Choi
has on his mind...

208
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,869
or what he's plotting.

209
00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:36,869
I can't read him.

210
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,579
It's not that.

211
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,079
What is it then?

212
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,380
Detective Choi...

213
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:50,519
said he's not interested
in Do Hyun Su anymore.

214
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:53,460
Why?

215
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:55,589
Since Do Hyun Su...

216
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:58,859
isn't a bad person.

217
00:21:09,009 --> 00:21:10,269
Dad!

218
00:21:12,779 --> 00:21:14,109
Dad.

219
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:17,279
I missed you so, so,

220
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:19,079
so, so much.

221
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,589
It seems like a reunion
between North and South.

222
00:21:39,069 --> 00:21:40,599
Is something wrong?

223
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,339
No, nothing's wrong.

224
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,809
My goodness.

225
00:21:48,049 --> 00:21:50,049
I've never seen Hee Seong
like that.

226
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:03,589
- Hello, Eun Ha.
- Hello.

227
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:04,759
- Hello.
- Hello.

228
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,660
Eun Ha.

229
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:11,940
Be a good girl today
and have a nice day.

230
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:15,970
Dad, you better not cry again
even if you miss me.

231
00:22:16,509 --> 00:22:18,140
Since you're an adult.

232
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,839
Okay.

233
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:28,420
Let's go inside, Eun Ha.

234
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:30,990
Eun Ha.

235
00:22:31,289 --> 00:22:32,390
Yes?

236
00:22:32,859 --> 00:22:34,119
Daddy...

237
00:22:35,529 --> 00:22:38,759
loves you very much.

238
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:42,700
Me too. Dad, I love you.

239
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,309
I gave it some thought,

240
00:22:50,109 --> 00:22:53,640
and if I quit right now,
it'll be too tough for our team.

241
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,180
So when we can get someone else
to fill in,

242
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,319
I'll back out quietly
without making an issue.

243
00:23:00,049 --> 00:23:01,849
I know it's tough for you too,

244
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:04,289
but please understand.

245
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:06,789
There are three important things
to remember.

246
00:23:07,289 --> 00:23:10,029
One, since your life
depends on this,

247
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:12,359
take time and think about it
carefully.

248
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:15,799
Two, think about it again
one more time.

249
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,099
And three,

250
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:22,910
we're totally swamped right now,
so get over here and start working.

251
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:43,730
What were you thinking about...

252
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,559
in front of the supermarket?

253
00:23:48,869 --> 00:23:50,099
I thought of...

254
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,539
the first time I held Eun Ha
after she was born.

255
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:57,609
I remember too.

256
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,180
You were so nervous, saying it was
your first time holding a baby.

257
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:04,609
After I met you,

258
00:24:05,579 --> 00:24:07,819
every moment was the first for me.

259
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:18,900
(Gangsu Police Station)

260
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,230
Will you be okay?

261
00:24:22,269 --> 00:24:23,829
Yes, of course.

262
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,200
I'll see you later.

263
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,259
(Reinvestigation Team)

264
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:07,880
Good morning.

265
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:09,710
"Good morning?"

266
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:11,450
How can you say that?

267
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:13,420
Are you mocking me?

268
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,289
Sir, Detective Cha isn't aware
of the situation.

269
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:18,319
Her kid was sick yesterday,

270
00:25:18,859 --> 00:25:21,220
so I sent her home right after
the raid.

271
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:24,759
Yeom Sang Chul escaped from
the ER while he was under arrest.

272
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:26,400
What?

273
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,700
Take a seat.

274
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:35,170
Good work.

275
00:25:36,109 --> 00:25:38,210
Since we're almost there,
let's keep focused.

276
00:25:38,809 --> 00:25:39,839
Yes, sir.

277
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,279
Is your kid okay? Who's sick?
The eldest or youngest?

278
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:46,119
Stop pretending like you know.

279
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,750
She only has one kid.

280
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,890
I know. I know that.

281
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:55,789
How old is your son?

282
00:25:56,059 --> 00:25:57,690
- It's a daughter.
- Okay.

283
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,200
Why don't we take one of these?

284
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,869
Since we had a rough night,
we need to take care of our health.

285
00:26:02,869 --> 00:26:05,140
Take one each. Here.

286
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,809
Can't you just give us two?

287
00:26:09,809 --> 00:26:11,880
Goodness, how could you be so stingy?

288
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,240
Fine, I'll especially give you two.

289
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,880
Since you look extra old.

290
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,049
Gosh.

291
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:20,920
Where was I?

292
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,390
You were talking about
a dedicated team.

293
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:24,750
A comprehensive investigation
on human trafficking...

294
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,019
will be handled by
a newly formed dedicated team.

295
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:28,890
We'll focus on arresting
Yeom Sang Chul...

296
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:30,559
and finding
Do Min Seok's accomplice.

297
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,230
Yeom Sang Chul's arrest comes first.

298
00:26:32,859 --> 00:26:35,500
There's a burner phone
he carries around.

299
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:39,140
Someone testified that he trafficks
people only with that phone.

For now,
we can't fill out the statement.

302
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:47,180
Hello?

303
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:49,109
I'm in front of the station.

304
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:52,220
I'd like to see you
without Ji Won knowing.

(Gangsu Police Station)

306
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:05,430
Think about it carefully.

307
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:07,960
About who you leaked this secret to.

308
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:12,269
Who sold you off to me?

309
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,869
I wonder who it is.

310
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:24,609
If you're here to thank me,
I don't need it.

311
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:28,150
I lied earlier.

312
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:31,420
I didn't want Ji Won to find out.

313
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:33,660
Lied about what?

314
00:27:35,089 --> 00:27:36,529
That Yeom Sang Chul found out
about the wiretap,

315
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:37,960
and that's why the plan
fell through.

316
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,829
That was a lie.

317
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,200
He got a call
during the middle of the deal.

318
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,670
Someone told Yeom Sang Chul...

319
00:27:47,569 --> 00:27:50,710
that I'm conspiring with the police.

320

Who?

321
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:55,849
They were purposefully waiting until
I met with Yeom Sang Chul.

322
00:27:56,809 --> 00:27:58,579
Their goal was to kill me.

323
00:27:59,049 --> 00:28:00,480
Who?

324
00:28:01,849 --> 00:28:03,289

325
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,220
A shocking truth...

326
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,990
about the Yeonju Serial
Murder Case was found out.

327
00:28:08,259 --> 00:28:11,390
Last night, the police arrested
five gang members...

328
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,900
during a human traffickers
round-up operation.

329
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:16,930
Since 2002, this organization
ran an employment agency...

330
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,500
to look for victims.

331
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,000
These victims were sold
to various areas in the country...

332
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,970
for prostitution and forced labor.

333
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:26,880
On top of that, they made deals
with serial murderer Do Min Seok,

334
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,809
making it even more shocking.

335
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:32,519
Meanwhile, the ringleader
Yeom Sang Chul fled...

336
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:34,079
while he was being taken away
by the police.

337
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:37,490
This is a picture of
Yeom Sang Chul who is wanted.

338
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:38,559
(Police releases pictures
at the time of his escape)

339
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,059
(Police releases pictures
at the time of his escape)

340
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:53,539
Mom. The world changed so much.

341
00:28:54,869 --> 00:28:56,039
You should exercise.

342
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:11,519
I missed three World Cups.

343
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:13,289
That's...

344
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,160
not important.

345
00:29:17,829 --> 00:29:22,000
I went out to cheer during the games
at Gwanghwamun Gate before.

346
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,039
You should come with me next time.

347
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:31,569
I'll take you with me.

348
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,109
Okay.

349
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:40,220
That's if I'm alive until then.

350
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,990
Dad failed.

351
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:50,589
It's just a matter of time...

352
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:55,569
before Do Hyun Su catches on.

353
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:09,049
I'll see if I can go visit Hyun Su.

354
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:11,609
Don't worry too much.

355
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:17,650
Also,
stop saying you'll turn yourself in.

356
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:20,690
My heart drops
whenever you say that.

357
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:26,059
I made you feel awkward earlier.

358
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,099
I'm sorry.

359
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:31,529
No, I didn't. It's...

360
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:34,140
It's because I like you.

361
00:30:35,069 --> 00:30:36,539
I want you to think of me a little.

362
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:40,339
Maybe just an eighth of
how much you worry about Hyun Su.

363
00:30:43,549 --> 00:30:45,380
Here's a taxi. Taxi.

364
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:52,859
Make sure you eat, okay?

365
00:30:52,859 --> 00:30:54,220
Call me
if you don't want to eat alone.

366
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:55,430
Okay.

367
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:57,059
Text me when you get there.

368
00:30:57,059 --> 00:30:58,630
I'm going to go buy a phone
right now.

369
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,930
Let me go.
Hurry up and close the door.

370
00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:03,670
Okay.

371
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:07,839
Sir, she's going to Cheonil-dong.
Please take good care of her.

372
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,950
Sir, I'm not going to Cheonil-dong.

373
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:26,920
Please go to Gangsu Police Station.

374
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:35,900
Do you mean Yeom Sang Chul has
a different goal aside from fleeing?

375
00:31:36,829 --> 00:31:40,140
The one who abetted him to kill me
promised him money.

376
00:31:41,869 --> 00:31:45,740
You seem to have an idea
who hired him.

377
00:31:47,609 --> 00:31:50,410
Someone who knows
I'm dealing with Yeom Sang Chul,

378
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:53,180
and someone who wants
to get rid of me. Also,

379
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:56,690
someone who has enough money
to order Yeom Sang Chul.

380
00:31:57,089 --> 00:31:59,490
I'll give you ten times this amount.

381
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:02,259
Just leave without anyone
knowing about it.

382
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:03,589
It can only be one person.

383
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,799
Of course, this is only a guess.

384
00:32:09,529 --> 00:32:10,769
We need to confirm.

385
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:12,140
"Confirm"?

386
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,140
If my guess is right,

387
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:18,680
you'll be able to catch Yeom
the moment we confirm.

388
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,279
I'll give them
the golden opportunity...

389
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:24,410
to kill me.

390
00:32:28,849 --> 00:32:33,059
Of course, I must get your help...

391
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:34,690
with this plan.

392
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:07,690
(Reporter Kim)

393
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:18,130
- Yes, Mu Jin.
- I bought a phone.

394
00:33:19,069 --> 00:33:20,869
I called you right away
after getting service.

395
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,440
I'm just telling you.

396
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,740
- Thank you.
- Mu Jin.

397
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:28,910
Yes?

398
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:30,980
You're the only friend Hyun Su has.

399
00:33:32,579 --> 00:33:34,049
What are you suddenly talking about?

400
00:33:34,849 --> 00:33:36,849
I came to see Detective Cha Ji Won.

401
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:39,720
- I'm going to turn myself in.
- What?

402
00:33:40,859 --> 00:33:43,329
- I'm sorry.
- Hae Su. Do Hae Su.

403
00:33:50,269 --> 00:33:52,200
Yeom Sang Chul's girlfriend,
Na Jin Hee.

404
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,339
(Na Jin Hee)

405
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,200
Isn't she highly probable?

406
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:57,470
Shouldn't we stakeout?

407
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:59,279
Their relationship
is already exposed,

408
00:33:59,509 --> 00:34:02,109
so it wouldn't be effective
concentrating manpower there.

409
00:34:02,109 --> 00:34:03,450
Did Detective Choi go somewhere?

410
00:34:04,049 --> 00:34:05,950
He's making a visit
to Jaerim Police Station.

411
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:13,360
Someone came for you,
Detective Cha Ji Won.

412
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:31,210
I'm here to keep my promise.

413
00:34:31,809 --> 00:34:35,010
The one I said I'd tell you
when the time was right.

414
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,250
- I'm the one...
- Ms. Do Hae Su.

415
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:45,590
I almost forgot.

416
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,260
"Ms. Do Hae Su"?

417
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:52,090
She must be Do Hyun Su's sister.

418
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,599
I told her to drop by the station...

419
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:57,300
if she has time
since I have some questions to ask.

420
00:35:00,269 --> 00:35:02,369
Ho Joon, where is it?

421
00:35:02,739 --> 00:35:04,369
Where is what?

422
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,639
The list
of Yeom Sang Chul's victims.

423
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:09,710
Here.

424
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:12,650
Shall we...

425
00:35:13,179 --> 00:35:14,320
go outside?

426
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:32,500
I...

427
00:35:33,769 --> 00:35:34,869
heard.

428
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:39,610
I heard you found out everything
about Hyun Su.

429
00:35:44,349 --> 00:35:45,380
The reason...

430
00:35:47,949 --> 00:35:50,690
The reason he had no choice
but to live as Baek Hee Seong...

431
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:52,960
was because of me.

432
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,630
The one who killed
the village foreman...

433
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,800
was me.

434
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:05,130
He took the blame instead.

435
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:08,469
He's not a dangerous person...

436
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,170
like you think he is.

437
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:11,409
Ms. Do.

438
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:17,679
Hyun Su...

439
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:22,079
is no longer a boy
whom you need to take care of.

440
00:36:24,449 --> 00:36:26,019
He's a dad to my daughter.

441
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,260
He's my family.

442
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,429
He's my person.

443
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:34,800
No matter...

444
00:36:36,099 --> 00:36:38,900
what hardship comes his way,
he has a wife...

445
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:42,440
who'll stand by his side.

446
00:36:48,949 --> 00:36:50,679
He said you were kind.

447
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:54,420
Whenever something bad happened,

448
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:57,250
people would suspect him.

449
00:37:00,489 --> 00:37:03,329
But you'd step up
and clear his name.

450
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,400
He felt indifferent,

451
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:11,530
but you were heartbroken and upset.

452
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:15,869
Since you were kind,

453
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:19,280
he knew you wouldn't have been able
to take all the criticism.

454
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:21,510
That's why he did it.

455
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:26,449
Because he was fine.

456
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,820
If you turn yourself in,

457
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,230
he may no longer
be a wanted criminal.

458
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:41,199
But he will feel indebted to you...

459
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:43,869
until the day he dies.

460
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,269
I can't allow that.

461
00:37:47,869 --> 00:37:48,969
So...

462
00:37:49,909 --> 00:37:51,840
please accept his decision.

463
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:55,480
And...

464
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:59,820
you should be the one
who feels indebted to him.

465
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:08,820
I'm terrible, aren't I?

466
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,500
This is what happened today.

467
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,610
To find out any additional crimes
Do Min Seok had committed,

468
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:26,309
I asked you if you recognized...

469
00:38:26,309 --> 00:38:28,210
any of Yeom Sang Chul's victims.

470
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,250
And you...

471
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:34,320
didn't recognize any.

472
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:38,920
All right, then.

473
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:41,760
Goodbye.

474
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:50,130
Thank you.

475
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:58,840
Thank you for understanding him.

476
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,449
I'll repay you.

477
00:39:04,349 --> 00:39:05,550
At all costs.

478
00:39:06,949 --> 00:39:08,980
During my time on this earth,

479
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:11,690
I'll make sure I repay you.

480
00:39:16,489 --> 00:39:17,860
Ji Won...

481
00:39:19,429 --> 00:39:21,329
is probably barely holding on.

482
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:26,070
She's carrying all the burden
because of me.

483
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,480
I'm afraid...

484
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,619
that one day,

485
00:39:42,219 --> 00:39:44,119
everything...

486
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,590
will break down.

487
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:51,860
So...

488
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:54,659
I beg you. Please...

489
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:56,170
Fine, I got it.

490
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,500
Don't make me repeat myself.

491
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:01,900
Please.

492
00:40:04,409 --> 00:40:07,840
How could I go up to her and say,

493
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,409
"Someone's trying to kill
your husband"?

494
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:14,849
Thank you.

495
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,989
Once everything settles down,

496
00:40:20,219 --> 00:40:21,519
I'll tell her myself.

497
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,260
Are you really
not going to tell me...

498
00:40:26,429 --> 00:40:27,860
who wants you dead?

499
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:38,840
I should be careful
for the time being.

500
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:41,739
(Ilsin Hospital, Director)

501
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,880
What?

502
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,849
- Money?
- I'm not demanding it for free.

503
00:40:48,219 --> 00:40:49,750
I will kill him.

504
00:40:49,949 --> 00:40:52,519
I'll kill him at all costs!

505
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:56,059
You failed to kill him
in your own office.

506
00:40:57,159 --> 00:40:58,889
And yet, you think you can kill him
when you've become...

507
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:00,599
a wanted criminal?

508
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:02,260
That's why...

509
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:07,800
you just need to lure him somewhere.

510
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:11,610
Lie low for now. Don't be reckless.

511
00:41:16,179 --> 00:41:17,650
(Hee Seong)

512
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,119
Hey, Hyun Su.

513
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,289
How did things go yesterday?

514
00:41:24,349 --> 00:41:27,460
You don't need to worry. I'm fine.

515
00:41:29,059 --> 00:41:32,630
Great. I'm relieved. I truly am.

516
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:36,469
Are you free tomorrow evening?

517
00:41:37,269 --> 00:41:40,639
I should update you
on everything that has happened.

518
00:41:41,769 --> 00:41:43,239
Sure.

519
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:47,440
I'll come over at 8pm tomorrow.

520
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:48,980
I'll say hi to Mother as well.

521
00:41:49,949 --> 00:41:51,079
Okay.

522
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,219
Hey, Hyun Su.

523
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:57,050
Why won't you pick up your phone?

524
00:41:57,719 --> 00:41:58,920
I was busy.

525
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:00,960
Hae Su went to see Detective Cha.

526
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,090
She's going to turn herself in.

527
00:42:07,059 --> 00:42:10,730
Call her.
She listens to you, you know?

528
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:13,340
Go.

529
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:15,400
What?

530
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:18,010
I said, go. You're distracting me.

531
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:22,239
I'm talking about your sister.
How could you be so calm?

532
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:35,289
You should go to her.

533
00:42:39,659 --> 00:42:42,730
She's fine.
I'm sure nothing has happened.

534
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:01,179
You don't care about me, do you?

535
00:43:02,219 --> 00:43:04,889
You've never thought
in my shoes, have you?

536
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:09,929
I don't know why
I should be treated like this.

537
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:20,699
Why are you looking at me like that?

538
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:23,510
We briefly dated when we were young.

539
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:26,639
Isn't it weird for you to still have
feelings for me after 20 years?

540
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:38,719
What are you doing?

541
00:43:43,429 --> 00:43:44,460
This is...

542
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:49,730
Why do you have this?

543
00:43:50,429 --> 00:43:51,599
Next time,

544
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:54,670
throw it somewhere I can't see.

545
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:58,210
I'm sorry.

546
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:01,980
Ever since fourth grade
when I had first seen you,

547
00:44:02,909 --> 00:44:04,309
my feelings have never changed.

548
00:44:07,849 --> 00:44:10,650
I'll try to change that.

549
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:47,389
Can't sleep?

550
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:52,659
I'm sorry.

551
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:54,960
I woke you up, didn't I?

552
00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:00,739
Why are you out here
instead of in bed?

553
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:08,179
Just because.

554
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:15,719
It's just...

555
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:19,420
Seeing myself lying next to you...

556
00:45:21,019 --> 00:45:22,690
feels so awkward.

557
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:27,199
I can't get any sleep.

558
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,780
There was something
I wanted to ask you earlier...

559
00:45:49,719 --> 00:45:51,320
but I couldn't.

560
00:45:53,219 --> 00:45:54,360
What is it?

561
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:57,829
How was...

562
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,460
your day?

563
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:13,309
It was...

564
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:16,409
quite all right.

565
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:39,869
He'll come here?

566
00:46:40,969 --> 00:46:42,139
Do Hyun Su?

567
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:46,110
Since he has to brief me on
what happened all this time.

568
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:51,849
But why is he coming here?

569
00:46:52,579 --> 00:46:53,849
Hyun Su never liked...

570
00:46:55,019 --> 00:46:57,849
to be seen by others.

571
00:46:58,889 --> 00:47:00,619
It's not a surprise.

572
00:47:01,559 --> 00:47:03,030
So you better...

573
00:47:04,059 --> 00:47:05,489
be careful tonight.

574
00:47:06,929 --> 00:47:10,269
He must not know
that you've woken up.

575
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:16,099
What about Do Hae Su?

576
00:47:17,369 --> 00:47:21,480
I can take care of that myself.

577
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:24,210
But the problem is Yeom Sang Chul.

578
00:47:26,849 --> 00:47:29,179
He can't be caught by the police...

579
00:47:29,789 --> 00:47:32,550
nor left to behave as he pleases.

580
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:37,690
He's an option we need in order to
get rid of Do Hyun Su.

581
00:47:40,059 --> 00:47:41,300
Don't get involved.

582
00:47:42,329 --> 00:47:43,630
I'll take care of it.

583
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:47,139
Rather than that...

584
00:47:52,309 --> 00:47:53,880
This is the material for
an overseas language program.

585
00:47:55,110 --> 00:47:56,449
Look over it carefully.

586
00:48:03,789 --> 00:48:05,219
(English Language Training)

587
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:21,940
What's wrong?

588
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:24,739
Dad.

589
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:28,210
Although ears that can hear
are important,

590
00:48:30,679 --> 00:48:32,179
eyes that can see are important
as well.

591
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:33,920
What do you mean?

592
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,590
It's nothing.

593
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:44,389
I don't know anything.

594
00:48:45,659 --> 00:48:47,829
My boss manages the client list
himself.

595
00:48:48,099 --> 00:48:49,300
I don't know.

596
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:51,769
I understand.

597
00:48:53,269 --> 00:48:56,510
But if Yeom Sang Chul isn't caught,
it'll be unfavorable for you.

598
00:48:58,369 --> 00:49:00,940
To be honest,
we're not interested in you.

599
00:49:02,179 --> 00:49:05,150
We just need to connect the
reinvestigation with Yeom Sang Chul.

600
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:09,380
Is there any place he would use...

601
00:49:10,019 --> 00:49:11,090
as a hideout?

602
00:49:12,219 --> 00:49:13,889
Someplace the police isn't aware of.

603
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:23,829
My boss received a phone call.

604
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:26,739
While he was dealing
with Do Hyun Su.

605
00:49:28,369 --> 00:49:31,110
That person asked him
to kill Do Hyun Su.

606
00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:35,840
In return for that,
he promised to pay my boss.

607
00:49:47,219 --> 00:49:48,320
Calm down.

608
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:51,389
Let's go somewhere quiet and talk.

609
00:49:51,389 --> 00:49:53,960
Someone is trying to kill
my husband.

610
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:56,300
How can I calm down
in this situation?

611
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:58,429
I know. I knew about it.

612
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:02,070
You knew about it?

613
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,039
Let's go somewhere else.

614
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:07,579
How can you not tell me anything?

615
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:09,179
Something important as that.

616
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:12,210
Your husband pleaded me
not to tell you.

617
00:50:12,449 --> 00:50:16,179
He said if you found out,
you wouldn't be able to handle it.

618
00:50:16,949 --> 00:50:19,789
He was afraid you would crumble
because of him.

619
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:33,840
Welcome.

620
00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:40,809
A medical volunteer team?

621
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:43,949
He was wearing a bracelet from
Ilsin Hospital's volunteer team.

622
00:50:45,550 --> 00:50:47,480
So I asked Director Baek Man Woo...

623
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:49,420
if he could get some materials
regarding that volunteer team.

624
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:52,650
Maybe I can remember
if I look at some photos.

625
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:56,860
When you met Director Baek,

626
00:50:57,929 --> 00:50:59,289
you didn't feel anything?

627
00:51:01,159 --> 00:51:05,469
Well, I saw his picture first
on the internet before we met.

628
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:08,269
Since it was almost 20 years ago,

629
00:51:10,139 --> 00:51:12,769
he would've been much younger
and skinnier.

630
00:51:20,219 --> 00:51:21,349
Did he look like him?

631
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:27,190
I can't remember.
My memory is so cloudy.

632
00:51:28,889 --> 00:51:31,460
I'll receive hypnotherapy again
tomorrow.

633
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:34,760
No.

634
00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:38,269
Your memory has probably been
distorted already.

635
00:51:39,269 --> 00:51:42,099
Since I pointed out
Director Baek as the culprit.

636
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:44,809
I...

637
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:47,809
haven't been helpful, have I?

638
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:53,219
It's okay. Today,

639
00:51:54,519 --> 00:51:56,119
I'm going to go check myself anyway.

640
00:51:56,550 --> 00:51:57,690
Check what?

641
00:51:59,289 --> 00:52:00,460
What do you mean?

642
00:52:09,869 --> 00:52:13,130
Don't you think we need
Do Hyun Su's cooperation again?

643
00:52:17,710 --> 00:52:21,380
His story is quite feasible,
so let's try it.

644
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:25,110
Let's wrap up the meeting then.
Good work, everyone.

645
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:35,659
Hey.

646
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:39,329
It's raining.
Shall I go pick you up?

647
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:04,590
You were like an angel,

648
00:53:05,949 --> 00:53:07,519
but I ruined you.

649
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,039
I have something to tell you.

650
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:36,590
I want to quit.

651
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:40,920
Thank you for being warm to me
all this time.

652
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:44,130
Please send the severance pay
and costs for keeping quiet...

653
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:47,159
to my account by next week.

654
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:49,159
Take care.

655
00:53:49,429 --> 00:53:51,030
"Costs for keeping quiet"?

656
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:54,570
I know much more...

657
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:58,710
than you think.

658
00:54:16,489 --> 00:54:17,489
You're here.

659
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,000
Wait.

660
00:54:27,199 --> 00:54:28,500
- Should we go for a walk?
- Do you want to go on a date?

661
00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:32,610
We were thinking the same thing.

662
00:54:34,210 --> 00:54:35,210
Let's go.

663
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:45,820
That was a lie too.

664
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:50,289
My favorite movie.

665
00:54:50,989 --> 00:54:52,329
"Life Is Beautiful"?

666
00:54:52,929 --> 00:54:54,000
Yes.

667
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:56,599
I lied to look good in front of you.

668
00:54:59,929 --> 00:55:03,340
It's also a lie
I can't eat raw food.

669
00:55:05,909 --> 00:55:07,679
You told me
you can't eat raw fish...

670
00:55:08,179 --> 00:55:09,940
because you suffered
an acute indigestion from it.

671
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:15,949
Actually, I can't eat it
because it reminds me...

672
00:55:15,949 --> 00:55:19,889
of the fishy smell
I used to smell on my father.

673
00:55:23,789 --> 00:55:24,860
Also...

674
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,800
Enough with your confessions.

675
00:55:34,769 --> 00:55:36,469
Stop talking about things like that,

676
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:40,610
and let's talk about
something ordinary.

677
00:55:42,139 --> 00:55:43,280
Like what?

678
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:55,320
Something like this.

679
00:56:12,139 --> 00:56:13,309
Are you okay?

680
00:56:14,809 --> 00:56:16,210
Yes, I'm okay.

681
00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:20,050
Are you...

682
00:56:22,219 --> 00:56:23,219
really okay?

683
00:56:24,789 --> 00:56:25,989
I'm okay.

684
00:56:26,449 --> 00:56:28,590
I said I'm okay,
so why do you keep on asking?

685
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:38,000
Actually, I'm not okay at all.

686
00:56:39,969 --> 00:56:42,599
I'm scared to death of
something happening again.

687
00:56:44,869 --> 00:56:46,809
My heart feels heavy at work...

688
00:56:46,809 --> 00:56:48,739
since I feel like
I'm deceiving my colleagues.

689
00:56:49,909 --> 00:56:52,849
I wanted to blame your sister
and ask her why she did it,

690
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,719
but I know I shouldn't
so I stopped myself.

691
00:56:56,789 --> 00:56:59,289
Why must you be the one
to live in hiding forever?

692
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:01,559
It's so unfair.

693
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:19,570
Do you know what makes me sad
the most?

694
00:57:24,050 --> 00:57:26,820
That you made another secret
I don't know about.

695
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:38,889
What do you know?

696
00:57:41,199 --> 00:57:43,030
I said, what do you know?

697
00:57:43,429 --> 00:57:45,599
I know you stabbed your son.

698
00:57:47,039 --> 00:57:50,099
You made someone else
act as your son to cover it up.

699
00:57:51,570 --> 00:57:54,880
The man who was hit
by the car your son was driving.

700
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:01,780
Soon Young.

701
00:58:03,849 --> 00:58:04,889
Don't be like this.

702
00:58:05,389 --> 00:58:06,590
I'm leaving.

703
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:11,559
Soon Young.

704
00:58:11,889 --> 00:58:14,559
Aren't we a family?

705
00:58:14,599 --> 00:58:17,099
I thought of you as my family.

706
00:58:18,099 --> 00:58:20,869
No. You can't go like this.

707
00:58:21,869 --> 00:58:23,809
We got along well.

708
00:58:23,809 --> 00:58:27,340
I even hired a lawyer for you
when you got your divorce.

709
00:58:27,610 --> 00:58:29,539
You said you'd never forget
my kindness.

710
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:32,349
So how can you do this?

711
00:58:32,909 --> 00:58:34,650
How can you?

712
00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:00,340
Mom.

713
00:59:13,449 --> 00:59:14,960
What did you just do?

714
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:22,360
All of you are crazy.

715
00:59:23,929 --> 00:59:26,869
If you don't send me the money,
I'll disclose everything.

716
00:59:28,199 --> 00:59:29,300
You have until next week.

717
01:00:04,010 --> 01:00:06,469
I knew you weren't trustworthy.

718
01:00:09,809 --> 01:00:11,150
Ms. Park Soon Young.

719
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:32,829
(Husband)

720
01:01:37,469 --> 01:01:40,570
Honey. Hurry home. Hurry.

721
01:01:41,070 --> 01:01:43,570
I don't know what to do.

722
01:02:18,809 --> 01:02:19,840
Dad.

723
01:02:22,039 --> 01:02:24,010
Mom's forehead got torn.

724
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:27,579
I think she needs stitches
right away.

725
01:02:28,949 --> 01:02:30,019
Yes.

726
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:42,460
I couldn't think of any other way...

727
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,230
to protect you.

728
01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:43,760
Why?

729
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:46,289
Why did you do that?

730
01:03:50,570 --> 01:03:51,570
Why did you do that?

731
01:03:55,239 --> 01:03:57,340
She knew too much.

732
01:04:03,139 --> 01:04:04,909
Why did you do such a thing?

733
01:04:05,849 --> 01:04:07,380
What do you expect me to do?

734
01:04:10,219 --> 01:04:12,219
You promised me!

735
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:14,389
You said you'd listen to me...

736
01:04:14,389 --> 01:04:16,260
if you could live
as Baek Hee Seong again.

737
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:21,300
Do you really want to see us dead?

738
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:24,230
Is that what you want?

739
01:04:28,199 --> 01:04:30,199
You said you wanted to live right.

740
01:04:31,639 --> 01:04:34,110
You said you wanted to live
like the others!

741
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:37,909
Let's cover this up.

742
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:49,789
Are you okay?

743
01:04:51,130 --> 01:04:53,429
Park Soon Young threatened us first.

744
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:58,599
She was going to control us forever,
using our weakness.

745
01:05:00,969 --> 01:05:03,800
She betrayed me first.

746
01:05:06,510 --> 01:05:07,980
If it wasn't for Hee Seong,

747
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:10,210
then I could've...

748
01:05:11,949 --> 01:05:15,179
In that moment,

749
01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:18,690
I hated her so much
that I wanted to kill her.

750
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:24,760
I'll fix Hee Seong.

751
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:28,929
I'll make sure...

752
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:31,769
I fix him.

753
01:05:33,670 --> 01:05:34,739
So...

754
01:05:37,639 --> 01:05:38,869
let's cover this up for now.

755
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:48,420
How...

756
01:05:49,650 --> 01:05:51,690
could we cover this up?

757
01:05:53,989 --> 01:05:55,159
I have...

758
01:06:00,159 --> 01:06:01,460
an idea.

759
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:14,210
Hey, Hee Seong.

760
01:06:15,179 --> 01:06:17,039
I'm sorry,

761
01:06:17,239 --> 01:06:19,710
but I'm afraid
I won't be able to go today.

762
01:06:20,579 --> 01:06:22,079
I have a sudden business trip.

763
01:06:22,579 --> 01:06:23,849
Is that so?

764
01:06:25,090 --> 01:06:27,590
That's too bad.
We'll take a rain check.

765
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:29,619
I have a favor to ask.

766
01:06:30,829 --> 01:06:31,929
What is it?

767
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:35,730
I'll be spending the night
in Gapyeong for my business trip.

768
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:39,429
I'd like to stay
at your villa there.

769
01:06:40,530 --> 01:06:44,570
Sure. It's our family villa,
after all.

770
01:06:46,769 --> 01:06:48,679
What time will you be arriving?

771
01:06:49,909 --> 01:06:52,750
I'll let the keeper know
so that you can use it.

772
01:06:55,179 --> 01:06:56,519
I think I'll be arriving there
around 10pm.

773
01:06:57,519 --> 01:06:59,389
Okay. 10pm.

774
01:07:00,219 --> 01:07:01,360
Got it.

775
01:07:22,340 --> 01:07:23,510
You have your opportunity.

776
01:07:24,309 --> 01:07:25,809
You better not fail.

777
01:07:28,150 --> 01:07:29,519
Tonight at 10pm.

778
01:07:30,719 --> 01:07:33,719
351 Gyeongjinsan-gil, Gapyeong.

779
01:07:34,489 --> 01:07:35,690
That's the address to my villa.

780
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:38,460
(Baek Hee Seong)

781
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:39,829
It's 10pm tonight.

782
01:07:41,860 --> 01:07:43,929
351 Gyeongjinsan-gil, Gapyeong.

783
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:46,099
It's Baek Man Woo's villa.

784
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:51,909
This is my plan.

785
01:07:54,340 --> 01:07:57,010
So your father...

786
01:07:58,710 --> 01:08:01,750
Director Baek Man Woo
is trying to kill you?

787
01:08:04,050 --> 01:08:05,119
I'm positive.

788
01:08:06,190 --> 01:08:09,059
If he's providing information
to Yeom Sang Chul,

789
01:08:10,619 --> 01:08:12,889
then the latter
will show up tonight.

790
01:08:15,429 --> 01:08:20,130
Detective Choi and the local police
will be there.

791
01:08:20,130 --> 01:08:22,000
If Yeom Sang Chul gets caught,

792
01:08:22,239 --> 01:08:24,210
it'll confirm that Director Baek
was the one...

793
01:08:24,210 --> 01:08:25,569
who gave him the tip-off.

794
01:08:31,350 --> 01:08:32,979
I'm going to go to his house...

795
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:35,350
and pressure him.

796
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:38,489
I'm going to make him...

797
01:08:40,189 --> 01:08:41,659
confess everything.

798
01:08:44,289 --> 01:08:45,430
Ji Won.

799
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:48,729
If Director Baek is apprehended,

800
01:08:51,369 --> 01:08:52,569
everyone will know...

801
01:08:54,239 --> 01:08:55,699
who I am.

802
01:08:56,369 --> 01:08:57,970
I've been prepared for this.

803
01:08:58,770 --> 01:08:59,909
I'm not scared.

804
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:06,479
I'll be back.

805
01:09:10,550 --> 01:09:11,720
Honey.

806
01:09:16,859 --> 01:09:19,329
You didn't forget
that I'm a detective, did you?

807
01:09:22,159 --> 01:09:24,369
I have the right
to make an immediate arrest.

808
01:11:05,770 --> 01:11:06,899
Do Hyun Su.

809
01:11:08,069 --> 01:11:09,369
He's here.

810
01:12:05,729 --> 01:12:10,399
(Flower of Evil)

811
01:12:10,399 --> 01:12:12,930
How much do you know?

812
01:12:13,199 --> 01:12:16,199
How much are you hiding?

813
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:18,539
If this is how he's going to play,

814
01:12:18,539 --> 01:12:20,670
then we should prepare ourselves.

815
01:12:21,239 --> 01:12:23,609
How did you know about my family?
Who are you?

816
01:12:24,279 --> 01:12:27,409
- You're meeting Yeom Sang Chul?
- He needs to kill me to get paid.

817
01:12:27,409 --> 01:12:29,050
He'll pick up my call.

818
01:12:29,050 --> 01:12:31,220
So the culprit doesn't have an ID?

819
01:12:31,319 --> 01:12:32,550
How am I supposed
to understand this?

820
01:12:32,550 --> 01:12:34,250
Yeom Sang Chul did it
right after he's run away.

821
01:12:34,250 --> 01:12:36,159
He's provoking us, isn't he?

822
01:12:36,159 --> 01:12:38,590
It's not me. It isn't.
