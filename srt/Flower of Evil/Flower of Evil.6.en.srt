8
00:00:43,049 --> 00:00:45,179
Yes, I'm on my way.

9
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,950
No, no. That's okay.

10
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,320
Thank you for saying that.

11
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:57,560
It'll be tough,
but I should face it myself.

12
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:00,869
Hey.

13
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,000
How...

14
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,209
did that person look?

15
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,239
I'm glad.

16
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,219
Excuse me.

17
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:54,989
Are you okay?

18
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:01,530
I'll call 911,

19
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,930
so please hang in there.

20
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:11,539
No.

21
00:02:11,669 --> 00:02:13,099
What did you say?

22
00:02:15,939 --> 00:02:18,680
I can't go to a hospital.

23
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,379
What?

24
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:25,319
I can't go to a hospital.

27

Prepare the defibrillator.
Charge it to 150 joules.

28
00:03:02,689 --> 00:03:03,789
Step back.

29
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:05,990
Shock.

30
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,090
200 joules.

31
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:14,669

33
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,810
Come down for a minute.

34
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:24,509
Why?

35
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,050
Hae Su.

36
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:48,930
I want you...

37
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,870
to live a normal life.

38
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:55,569
And don't ever...

39
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,939
Don't ever look for me.

40
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,879
I...

41
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,520
I won't...

42
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:14,530
live as Do Hyun Su anymore.

(Episode 6)

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,040
(Patient's name: Baek Hee Seong)

45
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:50,689
He's awake.

46
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,089
Do Hyun Su.

47
00:06:05,269 --> 00:06:06,269
It's over.

48
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:15,980
Do...

49
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:19,449
Hyun Su.

50
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,430
Are you okay?

51
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,459
I'll guide you back to your room.

52
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,610
Come on.

53
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:50,509
I'm okay.

54
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:53,850
I'm fine.

55
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,199
Please meet with me just once.

56
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm near where you work.

57
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,470
Just answer me this.

58
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,939
On May 12, 2002,

59
00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:21,569
you witnessed the abduction
of Ms. Jung Mi Sook, right?

60
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,009
- Hello?
- What is that?

61
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:25,540
- Ms. Jang Young Hee?
- Look at that.

62
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,009
- They caught him.
- Really?

63
00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:28,279
Park Gyung Chun, the criminal...

64
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:29,980
of the Hwesin-dong Chinese
Restaurant Murder Case,

65
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:32,519
turned out to be the husband
of victim Jung Mi Sook...

66
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:34,850
of the Yeonju Serial Murder Case.

67
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,690
Suspect Park Gyung Chun
who is a taxi driver murdered...

68
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,830
his passenger Nam brutally
at the restaurant Nam was operating.

69
00:08:42,259 --> 00:08:44,399
Park's crimes didn't stop there.

70
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,330
He also abducted and confined
another passenger named Baek,

71
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:49,370
causing severe injuries.

72
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,669
The reason behind Park's actions
and his relationships...

73
00:08:52,669 --> 00:08:55,610
with the victims
are being speculated.

74
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:00,379
The police are looking
into his motive for murder.

75
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,779
Name, Baek Hee Seong.
Age, 39.

76
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:07,389
He was brought here ten days ago
after suffering from cardiac arrest.

77
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:09,590
His heart had stopped
for eight minutes,

78
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,090
and we carried out
targeted temperature management.

79
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:14,929
- His temperature dropped to...
- "Targeted temperature management"?

80
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:17,600
Simply put,
when an animal hibernates,

81
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,659
their metabolism gets slower.

82
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,769
We quickly dropped
your temperature...

83
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,330
so that your metabolism
would slow down.

84
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,039
Doing so would prevent your cells
from deteriorating.

85
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:27,509
Your memories could be mixed up,

86
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:29,039
or you may not remember
some things,

87
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,980
so we'd like to ask you
a few questions.

88
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,110
Okay.

89
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:35,679
Please tell me your birthdate
and name.

90
00:09:37,549 --> 00:09:39,250
I was born on March 15,

91
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,419
1982.

92
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:43,120
My name is Baek Hee Seong.

93
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,919
What is your wife's name?

94
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:52,759
Cha Ji Won.

95
00:09:54,769 --> 00:09:55,830
And your daughter?

96
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,799
My daughter?

97
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:03,210
I have a daughter?

98
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,879
Dad, it's me.

99
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,580
Why don't you remember me?

100
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,820
It's fine.

101
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:16,220
Your memory will be restored
in inverse order.

102
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,720
This could happen.

103
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,899
Her name is Baek Eun Ha.
She's six.

104
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:27,399
She was born in September of 2015.

105
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:30,269
She attends Small Bird Kindergarten.

106
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,200
I hate you.

107
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:36,940
Your husband's memory
is completely back.

108
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,080
- Professor Shim.
- Sir.

109
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,620
Hello.

110
00:10:47,789 --> 00:10:48,889
How is he?

111
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:52,159
Sir, I think we should let him go.

112
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,230
He tricked his own doctor.

113
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:55,730
His vitals?

114
00:10:56,059 --> 00:10:58,830
He must be very healthy.
He's improving very quickly.

115
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,769
I'll let you guys talk.

116
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,629
Let's go.

117
00:11:06,169 --> 00:11:07,340
Sir.

118
00:11:07,409 --> 00:11:09,370
You must've been deeply worried.

119
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,710
Seeing how he no longer needs
the terrifying medical equipment,

120
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:18,950
I have nothing more to ask for.

121
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,250
How do you feel?

122
00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:25,360
- Do you feel any discomfort?
- I'm fine.

123
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,159
I'm sorry for making you worried.

124
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,470
What have you been doing these days?

125
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:36,700
- Do you think your life is yours...
- Honey.

126
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,669
His mother-in-law is here.

127
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:42,070
Hello.

128
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,379
I'm glad Hee Seong...

129
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:48,980
I mean, I'm glad my son-in-law
is healthy once again.

130
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,320
You should've told me
that your mother was coming.

131
00:11:54,149 --> 00:11:56,720
I'm sorry I didn't think that far.

132
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,990
I'd like some privacy
with my family.

133
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:04,159
Sorry? Your family?

134
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:07,769
Aren't we all family here?

135
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,029
Mom.

136
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:16,009
Eun Ha, I'll buy you a snack.
Let's go outside.

137
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:18,639
No, I want to be with Dad.

138
00:12:20,379 --> 00:12:22,149
Dad is exhausted. Let's go.

139
00:12:22,149 --> 00:12:24,679
I don't want to.

140
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:26,080
I hate you.

141
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,090
I hate you!

142
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:31,590
Eun Ha.

143
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:34,889
If you want me to go home soon,
you need to listen to your mom.

144
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,429
Okay?

145
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,399
Come here.

146
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:45,269
Let's go.

147
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,639
That little girl has an attitude.

148
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,110
She's just not likable.

149
00:12:55,309 --> 00:12:56,309
Baek Eun Ha.

150
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:58,779
What?

151
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:03,090
That little girl's name
is Baek Eun Ha.

152
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:08,629
My goodness, I've never met
such people before. What?

153
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,029
"My family"?

154
00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:12,500
Are they that special or what?

155
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,570
What are you looking at?

156
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:23,570
- What?
- What is it?

157
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,980
Nothing.

158
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,649
I'm just worried about him.
Let's go.

159
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:33,620
Anyway, what are we going to do?

160
00:13:34,049 --> 00:13:35,850
I'm talking about Park Gyung Chun.

161
00:13:36,789 --> 00:13:39,019
I heard he's not doing too well.

162
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,860
We still don't know
what's going to happen.

163
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:47,769
But we're not at a disadvantage.

164
00:13:49,169 --> 00:13:50,230
Better yet,

165
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,210
I think we could have an advantage.

166
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,110
He underwent surgery
due to a fractured skull,

167
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,110
but he's not doing too well.

168
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,019
He's regained consciousness,

169
00:14:05,419 --> 00:14:08,220
but he's not responding
to external stimulus.

170
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,419
Mr. Park?

171
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,159
Answer me, Mr. Park.

172
00:14:14,429 --> 00:14:16,360
Why is he like this?

173
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,460
The surgery went smoothly,

174
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,500
and his arteries are very clean.

175
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:25,970
You should rest up as well.

176
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:27,669
I will.

177
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,169
Eun Ha, say bye to your mom.

178
00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:35,250
Mom, when are we going home?

179
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,990
Your dad will leave
the hospital soon.

180
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:45,919
- Bye.
- Mom.

181
00:14:48,259 --> 00:14:49,429
Can you stay?

182
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:56,230
I just want to spend
more time with you.

183
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,240
He just needs to get discharged now.

184
00:15:04,909 --> 00:15:07,649
Things will look up
from now on, okay?

185
00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:13,379
Stop by this evening.

186
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:16,049
I'll make you braised short ribs
with ripe kimchi, your favorite.

187
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,059
Okay.

188
00:15:19,389 --> 00:15:20,490
Mom.

189
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,730
I'll see you later.

190
00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:24,960
Okay, I'll see you in a bit.

191
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,299
Okay.

192
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:31,000
Bye.

193
00:15:39,909 --> 00:15:40,980
Hey, Ho Joon.

194
00:15:41,549 --> 00:15:43,049
Don't worry about Ji Won.

195
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:45,120
I'll take care of her.

196
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:49,220
Is she not wondering
why you were there?

197
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,620
Do Min Seok's workshop
is situated there.

198
00:15:52,659 --> 00:15:54,259
I told her that I was curious...

199
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:58,330
and tagged along with Reporter Kim.

200
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,230
How can you trust that reporter?

201
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,870
I have something on him.

202
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:06,000
What is that?

203
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,470
That's something...

204
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:12,179
you don't need to know.

205
00:16:14,409 --> 00:16:16,379
Do you not trust us?

206
00:16:16,779 --> 00:16:19,879
How much do you trust me?

207
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:23,919
Quit talking such nonsense.

208
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:26,919
We need to focus on Park Gyung Chun.

209
00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:32,200
So? Do you have a plan?

210
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,860
Tell me.

211
00:16:34,429 --> 00:16:36,730
How will you stop him
from exposing us?

212
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:37,899
Calm down.

213
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:39,070
"Calm down"?

214
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:43,570
That punk Park Gyung Chun,
is a ticking bomb.

215
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:50,450
Do you remember what happened to us
15 years ago...

216
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:54,179
because you got so worked up?

217
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,289
Have you forgotten
why we're so afraid...

218
00:16:58,289 --> 00:17:00,490
of that worthless man?

219
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:12,640
This is too much for you to handle.

220
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,299
You should go home.

221
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:20,509
I'm saying this
because I'm worried about you.

222
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:24,849
I know.

223
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:29,549
I know how worthless I am.

224
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,359
I know very well.

225
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,539
Ji Won.

226
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:50,210
This is great. It's really great.

227
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,039
I'm truly exhilarated right now.

228
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,980
Why do you seem happier than I am?

229
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,920
Do you know how worried sick I was?

230
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,119
I was worried something might happen
to you as well.

231
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:30,750
Doctor.

232
00:18:33,349 --> 00:18:34,690
Why isn't he waking up?

233
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,519
You've raised his temperature,
so why isn't he waking up?

234
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,019
We're still administering
sleep-inducing medication.

235
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:41,630
Please check up on him just once.

236
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,799
How could he be so still?

237
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:48,230
I don't think he's sleeping.
He's like a doll.

238
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,670
I really think something wrong.
Please take a look at him.

239
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,599
You said the same thing yesterday.

240
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,339
Something really seems
strange today.

241
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,839
You can't panic like this already.

242
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,740
It's only been five days.

243
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:02,349
You may have to stay here longer.

244
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,720
You need to prepare yourself
and stay strong.

245
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,019
Ji Won.

246
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,559
Let's go.

247
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:17,359
He said it's only been five days.

248
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:22,670
How could a day feel like
an eternity?

249
00:19:28,509 --> 00:19:30,069
You seem more indifferent
than I thought.

250
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,210
I thought you'd start dancing...

251
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,980
once Mr. Baek woke up.

252
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:36,380
I already danced earlier.

253
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,180
Tell me about Park Gyung Chun.

254
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,380
It's driving me nuts.

255
00:19:41,019 --> 00:19:42,819
They'll determine whether to issue
a warrant tomorrow.

256
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:45,359
But I think he's trying something
funny to avoid being arrested.

257
00:19:45,859 --> 00:19:46,960
What did the doctor say?

258
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,630
"There are no evident signs..."

259
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:53,099
"that may have affected
his cognitive ability."

260
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,599
That's what he said.

261
00:19:54,829 --> 00:19:56,200
But his cancer had weakened
his body,

262
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,529
so it's too early
to jump to conclusions.

263
00:20:02,339 --> 00:20:05,509
The police is requesting
for our cooperation.

264
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,079
The investigation to issue
Park Gyung Chun's warrant...

265
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:10,650
will proceed as planned tomorrow.

266
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:15,220
The doctor's opinion will be
unfavorable for him.

267
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:20,460
There's a high possibility
he'll be arrested tomorrow.

268
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,990
That means...

269
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,630
We need to do something tonight.

270
00:20:34,339 --> 00:20:36,670
Do you want to do it?

271
00:20:38,339 --> 00:20:42,150
Park's body is already addicted
to narcotic analgesics.

272
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,279
Medically speaking,
it won't be surprising...

273
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:49,319
if he dies from a heart attack
this instant.

274
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:52,460
On top of that, he doesn't have
any family...

275
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,089
that will request an autopsy.

276
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:00,200
If you say yes, I can help.

277
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:05,170
You won't do it yourself?

278
00:21:21,019 --> 00:21:22,049
I'll think about it.

279
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:24,049
Fine.

280
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,730
Tonight is your only chance.

281
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,400
Don't forget that.

282
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,809
Receiving a statement
from the victim?

283
00:21:47,009 --> 00:21:49,279
Yes. Mr. Baek Hee Seong.

284
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,980
Do you think it's possible?

285
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,789
The victim's statement mentioning
how cruel and cunning...

286
00:21:55,789 --> 00:21:57,950
Park Gyung Chun is,
will help us immensely.

287
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:02,960
And Mr. Baek was even tortured.

288
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,400
Yes.

289
00:22:08,329 --> 00:22:09,700
- You're unbelievable.
- Who is he?

290
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:12,769
- Are you really alive?
- What a pervert.

291
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,769
I thought you'd really die
this time.

292
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:19,940
You're really persistent.

293
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:23,549
Ji Won told me you didn't receive
police investigation yet.

294
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:26,150
I made an excuse that I was busy
and avoided them.

295
00:22:26,619 --> 00:22:28,789
We haven't agreed on what to say
about this issue yet.

296
00:22:30,589 --> 00:22:31,660
Good job.

297
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:33,960
I'm sorry, but can you not
compliment me?

298
00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:35,730
It feels like I've become
your minion.

299
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,759
Listen to me carefully from now on.

300
00:22:41,529 --> 00:22:43,099
I know, I get it.

301
00:22:43,099 --> 00:22:45,700
So you and I... Yes, by coincidence.

302
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:47,869
Do you think I'm stupid?

303
00:22:47,869 --> 00:22:49,910
I understand what you said.
Why do you keep asking me...

304
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,940
Hey, talk to you later.

305
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:59,750
Ma'am, give it to me. I'll do it.

306
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:03,289
Give it to me.

307
00:23:07,059 --> 00:23:08,660
I told you to stop coming to see me.

308
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,190
I really have nothing to tell you.

309
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,859
Come on, don't say that.

310
00:23:13,529 --> 00:23:14,900
You are...

311
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,500
the last person who saw
Jung Mi Sook alive.

312
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:20,440
You witnessed what happened
on that night 18 years ago.

313
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,140
You just have to tell me that.

314
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,140
I don't know.

315
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:26,779
How could I remember something
from 18 years ago?

316
00:23:26,779 --> 00:23:28,579
You even called the police.

317
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,809
I was mistaken.

318
00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:33,720
You heard about the
Park Gyung Chun case lately, right?

319
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,890
Jung Mi Sook was
Park Gyung Chun's wife.

320
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:40,519
When you reported it,
if the police investigated properly,

321
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:41,759
they could've saved her.

322
00:23:42,289 --> 00:23:43,359
This is my daughter.

323
00:23:43,829 --> 00:23:47,660
I just want to live quietly
supporting my daughter.

324
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,329
Ms. Jang, you must've
misunderstood me.

325
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:52,640
I'm not trying to torment you
or anything.

326
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,640
I'm just trying to expose
the police's poor investigation.

327
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,769
Mr. Kim, stop coming now.

328
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,640
Pretend you don't know me.

329
00:24:00,609 --> 00:24:04,210
What if I say something wrong
and he hurts my daughter?

330
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:07,880
Do Min Seok died a long time ago.

331
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,220
Not him!

332
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,420
What? What do you mean?

333
00:24:14,859 --> 00:24:17,460
No, it's... Move.

334
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,529
Can you really do this?

335
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,569
Yes, I'm okay.

336
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,140
Are you confident?

337
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:32,480
Do I need confidence to do this?

338
00:24:34,109 --> 00:24:35,180
No.

339
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:38,250
It's just that it might be hard
if you think about what happened.

340
00:24:47,789 --> 00:24:48,859
Why are you so startled?

341
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,029
See? There was something
on your hair.

342
00:25:04,509 --> 00:25:06,140
Why are you nervous?

343
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,680
Am I?

344
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,519
Help!

345
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,759
Hee Seong.

346
00:25:23,329 --> 00:25:24,559
Why are you looking at me like that?

347
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,670
I keep thinking of...

348
00:25:31,099 --> 00:25:32,269
how you looked at that moment.

349
00:25:37,509 --> 00:25:40,079
Excuse me, I wrote up
a questionnaire.

350
00:25:40,579 --> 00:25:42,779
If it's too hard,
you can signal to me any time.

351
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,450
Okay, thank you.

352
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:48,589
Detective Choi.

353
00:25:48,789 --> 00:25:50,789
Hey.

354
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:53,059
Me? I'm fine.

355
00:25:53,059 --> 00:25:55,230
I know you guys were
worried sick about me.

356
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:57,490
But I'm really...fine.

357
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:00,799
So although you never came,
I'm saying you don't have to visit.

358
00:26:01,529 --> 00:26:03,569
I'm sorry. He's upset.

359
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:05,869
It's been a long time.

360
00:26:06,269 --> 00:26:07,740
I heard you were injured,

361
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,039
but as you can see,
I wasn't in a situation to visit.

362
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,339
I know how tough it was for you.

363
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,880
But seeing how much Park Gyung Chun
was injured,

364
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,049
you must've fought back hard.

365
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:20,480
Did you learn how to fight
when you were young?

366
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:22,890
He's a victim.
Please watch your mouth.

367
00:26:23,289 --> 00:26:24,349
What is that?

368
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,089
It's a questionnaire.

369
00:26:26,589 --> 00:26:28,630
How could a detective
hand out a questionnaire?

370
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,500
Shall we begin?

371
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:36,029
You'll do it yourself?

372
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,940
I was getting so bored.
Let's begin then.

373
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:44,170
Mr. Baek Hee Seong.

374
00:26:46,109 --> 00:26:47,109
Yes?

375
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:52,220
Why do you think Park Gyung Chun
didn't kill you right away...

376
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,079
but decided to torture you instead?

377
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,819
Usually, torture is...

378
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:03,589
the most extreme measure used...

379
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:05,460
when someone wants to hear
an answer.

380
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:10,569
That's what I want to know the most.

381
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,400
What kind of question...

382
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,609
did Park Gyung Chun ask you?

383
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,380
What do you think you're doing?

384
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:22,180
You're asking a victim
a leading question.

385
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:25,920
Honey, you don't have to try
to answer too hard.

386
00:27:27,049 --> 00:27:29,319
If you don't know or can't remember,

387
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,190
just keep it simple.

388
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:32,490
Ji Won.

389
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,690
If you're going to be a detective,
sit next to me.

390
00:27:36,329 --> 00:27:38,460
And if you're going to aid Mr. Baek,
sit next to him.

391
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,029
Don't intervene suddenly like that.

392
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:43,869
He's right, you just overreacted.

393
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:46,170
You know how Detective Choi is.

394
00:27:46,269 --> 00:27:49,069
Hurry up and decide your stance.
We need to work.

395
00:27:51,809 --> 00:27:52,940
I'm okay.

396
00:27:55,609 --> 00:27:57,549
I better just stay out of it.

397
00:28:21,369 --> 00:28:23,210
In the process
of convincing Park Gyung Chun,

398
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:25,779
I mentioned that there's a detective
in my family.

399
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,750
He asked why
his wife wasn't saved...

400
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,279
and took out his anger on me.

401
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:32,950
I was stabbed in the arm
and then lost consciousness.

402
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:38,019
When I woke up, the water
was already up to my chest.

403
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,930
This is the strangest part.

404
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:48,329
Why didn't Park Gyung Chun
murder you...

405
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:51,099
the same way
he murdered Nam Soon Gil?

406
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,099
Why was he taking the time
in trying to drown you?

407
00:28:56,539 --> 00:28:57,670
That's...

408
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,779
what I'm curious about too.

409
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,809
I think I might know.

410
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:10,390
If the police were five minutes...
No, just slightly late,

411
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:12,920
we wouldn't have been able
to save Mr. Baek.

412
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:16,029
Then we would suffer
from feeling guilty forever.

413
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:18,029
Maybe he was going for that...

414
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,130
because he hates the police.

415
00:29:21,869 --> 00:29:25,339
I see. That's possible.
You're amazing.

416
00:29:26,069 --> 00:29:28,839
Hey.
Are you Park Gyung Chun's lawyer?

417
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:32,140
How would you know
what he wanted so well?

418
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:35,710
That's true.

419
00:29:36,549 --> 00:29:39,480
Only Park Gyung Chun knows
what he wanted.

420
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:42,890
Of course, I don't know it either.

421
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:47,890
Could you only ask me questions
I can answer?

422
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:50,160
Detective Choi Jae Seop?

423
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,730
So, Mr. Baek Hee Seong.

424
00:29:57,099 --> 00:30:00,869
You got to meet Kim Mu Jin by chance
and you accompanied him.

425
00:30:00,869 --> 00:30:02,970
You coincidentally
got on Park Gyung Chun's taxi,

426
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:05,710
and you were
coincidentally abducted. Right?

427
00:30:09,009 --> 00:30:10,079
Is this a question?

428
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:12,650
I'm in question.

429
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:19,519
Detective Choi.

430
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:22,759
Do you dislike me?

431
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:25,259
Me? Why?

432
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:27,660
I really like Detective Cha.

433
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,000
I know everything.

434
00:30:33,269 --> 00:30:35,940
When Ji Won first introduced us,

435
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,039
you drank with me and treated me
like a brother,

436
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:42,980
but you told Ji Won to break up
with me behind my back.

437
00:30:44,779 --> 00:30:45,849
You said I was full of myself.

438
00:30:49,819 --> 00:30:53,220
Did I do something to offend you?

439
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:57,329
If you tell me what it is,
I'll sincerely apologize.

440
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:03,970
There's something I realized
while living my life.

441
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,299
As you can see,
I'm not very friendly.

442
00:31:07,539 --> 00:31:09,869
Despite that, the people who try
to get on my good side...

443
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:11,609
are 1 of these 3.

444
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,509
Either they lied,

445
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:15,880
are planning to lie,

446
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:18,450
or are lying to me right now.

447
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:24,119
This means...

448
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:28,859
you have a personal bias of me,

449
00:31:30,089 --> 00:31:32,599
yet you're in charge of getting
my testimony?

450
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:40,000
- Detective Im Ho Joon.
- Yes?

451
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,140
I think it'd be best
for you to take over.

452
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,180
Yes. Sure.

453
00:31:47,609 --> 00:31:49,309
Detective Choi, I'll take over.

454
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:54,579
Fine. Questioning victims
isn't my specialty.

455
00:31:55,849 --> 00:31:58,220
Once Park Gyung Chun gets arrested,

456
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:00,990
I'll expose that dirty mind of his.

457
00:32:23,349 --> 00:32:24,950
This is Cha Ji Won
of Gangsu Police Station.

458
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,650
Firstly, I want to thank you.

459
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:31,049
Thank you for catching the criminal.

460
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:35,460
Soon Gil was wronged,
but you set things right.

461
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,460
I only did what I should do.

462
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:41,960
There's another reason I called.

463
00:32:42,329 --> 00:32:44,700
I thought I should tell you this.

464
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:48,299
What is it?

465
00:32:51,109 --> 00:32:53,910
I have something to report
about Do Hyun Su.

466
00:32:56,549 --> 00:33:00,150
I called hoping it'll help you.

467
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,990
I don't think I should tell you
over the phone.

468
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,990
I'm going to my parents' next week.

469
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:10,390
I'd like to meet you before then.

470
00:33:13,099 --> 00:33:15,599
I'll go over
as soon as the case settles.

471
00:33:17,369 --> 00:33:18,400
Also...

472
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:22,410
Detective Cha?

473
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:26,839
Could you not tell others...

474
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:29,450
about the information on Do Hyun Su?

475
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:32,579
Of course, I won't.

476
00:33:33,549 --> 00:33:36,619
I want you to be acknowledged too.

477
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,690
Thank you for your understanding.

478
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,259
After the Hwesin-dong
Chinese Restaurant Murder Case...

479
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:50,369
was found out to be
another tragedy caused by...

480
00:33:50,369 --> 00:33:52,029
the Yeonju Serial Murder Case,

481
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,200
all interests are on Do Min Seok,

482
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,440
the beginning of all this horror.

483
00:33:57,069 --> 00:33:59,609
Right now, I'm at the workshop
where the notorious murder...

484
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,579
Do Min Seok
and his missing son Do Hyun Su...

485
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:05,210
lived together.

486
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:09,250
The workshop still looks like
the way it was before.

487
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:12,159
There are spider webs
on every corner,

488
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:15,760
while hideous artifact equipment
are rolling around on the floor.

489
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:18,289
It's like a haunted house.

490
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:21,730
The place where victims
were actually confined...

491
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:23,469
was the basement
of the storage beside this room.

492
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:25,539
Let's go over there.

493
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:31,269
This is the basement where
Do Min Seok held victims locked up.

494
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:42,690
It feels like I'm entering a jail
many meters below ground.

495
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:44,019
(The horrifying basement
where victims were locked up)

496
00:34:44,019 --> 00:34:46,159
I'm short of breath.

497
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,820
(The horrifying basement
where victims were locked up)

498
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,289
There's a huge cage.

499
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:55,429
(The truth behind the huge cage
where victims were confined)

500
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:57,570
Let me go inside myself.

501
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:08,309
Even as a male adult,
I feel helpless inside.

502
00:35:14,179 --> 00:35:16,219
(Traces believed to show
how victims were bound)

503
00:35:16,219 --> 00:35:19,590
This looks like a cable tie
that likely tied the victims.

504
00:35:20,789 --> 00:35:22,690
It's been 18 years
since the case happened,

505
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:27,130
but the traces of this horrific
nightmare remain here.

506
00:35:35,539 --> 00:35:37,969
Once Park Gyung Chun gets arrested,

507
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,710
I'll expose that dirty mind of his.

508
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:42,809
Tonight is your only chance.

509
00:35:44,349 --> 00:35:45,409
Don't forget that.

510
00:35:58,159 --> 00:35:59,230
I finished everything well.

511
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,469
What's the matter?

512
00:36:06,269 --> 00:36:07,269
Did something happen?

513
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:09,670
No.

514
00:36:12,139 --> 00:36:13,840
Ho Joon told me you did well.

515
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:16,050
Good job.

516
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,429
No.

517
00:36:31,059 --> 00:36:33,900
It looks like
you're worried about something.

518
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:37,170
What is it?

519
00:36:38,369 --> 00:36:39,440
Tell me.

520
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:43,309
No, I'm not worried.

521
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,480
Ji Won.

522
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:52,949
You should go home
and get proper rest tonight.

523
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,489
You look exhausted.

524
00:36:58,489 --> 00:37:00,420
How can I rest at home?

525
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:03,230
Ji Won?

526
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:06,260
I said, how can I sleep in peace
at home?

527
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,130
What's wrong?

528
00:37:12,539 --> 00:37:13,699
Are you asking me what's wrong?

529
00:37:16,869 --> 00:37:19,110
You almost died in front of my eyes.

530
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,809
That was just ten days ago.

531
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:25,780
Do you know how I felt
while you were...

532
00:37:27,179 --> 00:37:28,880
hanging by a thread for ten days?

533
00:37:30,949 --> 00:37:31,989
Do you have any idea?

534
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:39,199
My legs would shake if I got a call
while I'm away from the hospital.

535
00:37:40,699 --> 00:37:41,960
Why are they looking for me?

536
00:37:43,329 --> 00:37:45,639
Who could be looking for me
so urgently?

537
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:49,340
I felt like dying from suffocation
during the ten seconds...

538
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,110
to check who the caller is.

539
00:37:52,309 --> 00:37:54,380
Did you tell me
to go home and get proper rest?

540
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:58,280
Every time I went back
to our empty house,

541
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:02,289
do you know how terrified I was...

542
00:38:03,219 --> 00:38:05,119
that I might end up
living there by myself?

543
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:08,489
You have no idea
what kind of life I led...

544
00:38:08,489 --> 00:38:09,960
for the past ten days,

545
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:13,360
and you'll never know.

546
00:38:17,369 --> 00:38:18,429
But...

547
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:21,269
for all these years...

548
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,309
Who are you?

549
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,210
Answer me!

550
00:38:34,449 --> 00:38:35,849
- I'm leaving.
- Ji Won.

551
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,260
Let's talk a bit more.

552
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,989
About what?

553
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:48,130
Just anything.
We can talk about anything.

554
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:51,269
Anything will do.

555
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:55,809
I'll just listen quietly.

556
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:57,110
Next time.

557
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:00,110
I suddenly too exhausted.

558
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,880
I want to just sleep.

559
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:30,309
Are you awake?

560
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,010
Do you recognize me?

561
00:39:42,849 --> 00:39:44,820
It's me, Ji Won.

562
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,329
Hae Su.

563
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,869
What?

564
00:40:10,579 --> 00:40:11,679
Hae Su.

565
00:40:19,219 --> 00:40:20,360
I want you...

566
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,260
to live a normal life.

567
00:40:27,699 --> 00:40:29,030
And don't ever...

568
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,400
Don't ever look for me.

569
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:39,070
I...

570
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:42,710
I won't...

571
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:46,250
live...

572
00:40:48,849 --> 00:40:50,690
as Do Hyun Su anymore.

573
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:26,460
I'm truly sorry.

574
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,059
But we can't continue working
if reporters keep sneaking in.

575
00:41:30,389 --> 00:41:31,460
You know that.

576
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,460
I understand.

577
00:41:36,929 --> 00:41:38,099
I'll quit.

578
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,639
I'm really sorry.

579
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:43,840
- But still, thank you.
- For what?

580
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:47,510
For apologizing.

581
00:41:49,349 --> 00:41:51,809
Thank you for not shouting
or getting angry.

582
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,420
You neither asked me why
I didn't tell you about this...

583
00:41:55,219 --> 00:41:56,949
nor blamed me
for almost ruining your life.

584
00:41:58,389 --> 00:42:00,219
Who'd do that?

585
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:05,690
Shouldn't you
break up with me first?

586
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:06,960
(Kim Mu Jin)

587
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:08,260
You're right.

588
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:11,199
You remind me of your dad.
It gives me the creeps.

589
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,300
There are many people...

590
00:42:15,539 --> 00:42:17,070
who are angry with me.

591
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:22,210
I'm not someone who's shameless
or lacks common sense.

592
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:26,079
It's just that I can't keep this in
any longer.

593
00:42:26,849 --> 00:42:28,920
Can I please use your toilet?
It'll only take a minute.

594
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,219
You see,

595
00:42:31,989 --> 00:42:34,460
this is regarding my human rights.

596
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:36,190
I'm not lying.

597
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:39,429
Gosh, I'm truly sorry.

598
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:43,500
Reporter Kim, please!

599
00:42:44,829 --> 00:42:46,639
This is an invasion of privacy.

600
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:49,139
You're being too harsh.

601
00:42:49,809 --> 00:42:51,340
Then is it not harsh of you
to spark my interest...

602
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,880
by hinting that Do Min Seok
had an accomplice...

603
00:42:53,079 --> 00:42:54,739
and not telling me who it is?

604
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:58,349
I don't know. I don't know anything.

605
00:42:59,449 --> 00:43:01,550
Please muster up your courage
to reveal the truth.

606
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:03,119
Truth, my foot.

607
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:06,119
Tell me.

608
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:10,690
If I agree to be interviewed,
will you protect my daughter and me?

609
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,460
It's not fair to keep dragging
your daughter into this.

610
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:15,900
Who are you?

611
00:43:16,329 --> 00:43:17,699
Why are you pestering my mom?

612
00:43:17,699 --> 00:43:18,829
Go inside.

613
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:20,300
I wasn't.

614
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:22,369
I'm a reporter who wants
to reveal the truth,

615
00:43:22,369 --> 00:43:23,409
but I need to use your toilet.

616
00:43:23,409 --> 00:43:26,079
If you don't scurry away
on the count of three,

617
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,239
I'm calling the police.

618
00:43:27,909 --> 00:43:29,179
Oh, come on.

619
00:43:29,179 --> 00:43:30,880
- One,
- It won't take long.

620
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:33,119
- two...
- It'll only take a minute.

621
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:34,920
I said to scurry away.

622
00:43:36,019 --> 00:43:37,119
Three.

623
00:43:41,059 --> 00:43:42,119

625
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:21,500

00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:46,739
(Where the Morning Star Hovers)

659
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:36,250
Don't...

660
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:38,920
leave any needle marks on his body.

661
00:49:16,789 --> 00:49:19,329
Every afternoon between
2pm and 3pm,

662
00:49:19,329 --> 00:49:21,030
he receives dressing
for his wounds.

663
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,230
There are two detectives
who work shifts...

664
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:26,570
from 9am to 9pm...

665
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:29,340
and keep watch next to him.

666
00:49:30,409 --> 00:49:32,570
So the detective
who works at night...

667
00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:35,780
doesn't know about
the dressing procedure at all.

668
00:49:45,389 --> 00:49:46,789
I'm here for his dressing.

669
00:49:47,019 --> 00:49:48,519
This late?

670
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:52,289
I'm just a poor intern
working late like you.

671
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:55,030
I'm so exhausted, goodness.

672
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:57,199
Why don't you go out
for a cup of coffee?

673
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,469
Actually,

674
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:02,800
I'm craving a cigarette.

675
00:50:02,869 --> 00:50:04,570
- I'll be back soon.
- Okay.

676
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:41,409
I've been waiting.

677
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:00,860
Did you even know
what I came here to do?

678
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:03,769
I knew you'd come to kill me.

679
00:51:05,469 --> 00:51:08,369
What are you trying to pull
this time?

680
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:11,710
Where is Mi Sook?

681
00:51:16,309 --> 00:51:17,349
Do you really...

682
00:51:17,409 --> 00:51:18,510
not know...

683
00:51:19,349 --> 00:51:20,980
where she is buried?

684
00:51:28,159 --> 00:51:29,989
I'm the same as you.

685
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:33,460
I found out...

686
00:51:34,429 --> 00:51:36,300
that my dad was a serial killer
through TV.

687
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:40,269
Is that so hard to believe?

688
00:51:48,409 --> 00:51:50,179
I thought...

689
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:56,550
you would tell me the truth
if you were to kill me.

690
00:51:59,789 --> 00:52:01,489
Whether you believe me or not,

691
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:04,929
I have no intention
of letting you live.

692
00:52:07,429 --> 00:52:09,699
You tried to ruin my life...

693
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:12,969
and you really can if you want.

694
00:52:14,469 --> 00:52:16,510
There's something I realized
while lying down all day...

695
00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:18,110
staring up at the ceiling.

696
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,610
The facts that I know about you...

697
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,650
are mere rumors.

698
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:27,579
And...

699
00:52:31,219 --> 00:52:33,889
the fact that
I might have been wrong.

700
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:41,929
I killed an innocent person...

701
00:52:43,269 --> 00:52:44,869
and tortured you cruelly.

702
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:46,500
Go on.

703
00:52:49,969 --> 00:52:51,469
There's no need to hesitate.

704
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:06,949
This looks like a cable tie
that likely tied the victims.

705
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:27,599
I have a question.

706
00:54:34,179 --> 00:54:36,409
When you found out
Jung Mi Sook had died,

707
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:40,019
how did you feel?

708
00:54:43,719 --> 00:54:44,750
What?

709
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,059
How did you feel?

710
00:54:50,659 --> 00:54:51,829
When your wife died?

711
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:54,360
What...

712
00:54:54,659 --> 00:54:55,730
Why...

713
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,800
Why do you want to know that?
Do you really want to know?

714
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Why?

715
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:03,969
Why do you want to know that?

716
00:55:07,079 --> 00:55:09,179
You almost died in front of my eyes.

717
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:12,480
You have no idea
what kind of life I led...

718
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,849
for the past ten days,

719
00:55:15,349 --> 00:55:17,219
and you'll never know.

720
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:25,590
I just want to know.

721
00:55:33,739 --> 00:55:34,969
I wanted to die.

722
00:55:37,110 --> 00:55:38,369
Why didn't you?

723
00:55:39,239 --> 00:55:40,880
I had something to take care of.

724
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,079
I wanted...

725
00:55:48,849 --> 00:55:51,289
to take Mi Sook to someplace...

726
00:55:51,519 --> 00:55:53,050
more safe and comfortable.

727
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:55,489
But she was already dead.

728
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,429
What use is that?

729
00:56:04,130 --> 00:56:06,699
Because no matter how much
people spread rumors about Mi Sook,

730
00:56:09,969 --> 00:56:11,610
I could change all of that.

731
00:56:25,449 --> 00:56:26,590
Goodbye, then.

732
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:41,469
Thanks for changing
Park Gyung Chun's dressing for me.

733
00:56:42,070 --> 00:56:43,840
Why are you so afraid
when he's cuffed to the bed?

734
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:47,940
I just kept feeling like
he was staring at me.

735
00:56:48,579 --> 00:56:50,750
You're such a coward.

736
00:56:52,179 --> 00:56:54,679
Excuse me. Is Park Gyung Chun's...

737
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:56,820
dressing changed twice a day?

738
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:59,519
- What?
- I'm the detective in charge.

739
00:57:02,019 --> 00:57:03,090
We change it once a day.

740
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:05,230
But you already changed it today?

741
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:07,099
Yes. I did it myself.

742
00:57:38,289 --> 00:57:39,690
About what you asked last time.

743
00:57:45,699 --> 00:57:46,840
The fish keychain.

744
00:57:53,210 --> 00:57:55,780
Someone came to the funeral
and gave it to my sister.

745
00:57:57,449 --> 00:57:58,809
I got it from my sister.

746
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:00,980
Why are you telling me that now?

747
00:58:04,090 --> 00:58:05,989
Would you have trusted me then?

748
00:58:07,519 --> 00:58:10,230
Instead, you would've abducted
my sister and drowned her too.

749
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:15,829
I wonder who it was.

750
00:58:17,630 --> 00:58:19,500
They left it with my sister
on purpose.

751
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:22,469
Why?

752
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:26,670
Do you mean...

753
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:30,010
There was a witness who saw
Jung Mi Sook get abducted,

754
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:33,550
while I became my father's alibi
for the same hour.

755
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:38,190
What if both the witness and I
were telling the truth?

756
00:58:39,619 --> 00:58:40,719
Are you saying Do Min Seok...

757
00:58:41,989 --> 00:58:43,489
really had an accomplice?

758
00:58:46,530 --> 00:58:48,500
(Be careful of falls)

759
00:58:51,199 --> 00:58:52,929
I heard you have two months left.

760
00:58:54,969 --> 00:58:57,340
Instead of chasing a delusion
like Do Hyun Su,

761
00:58:58,269 --> 00:58:59,940
you can try to chase
the real criminal.

762
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:03,380
The choice is yours.

763
00:59:07,150 --> 00:59:08,250
Hey.

764
00:59:09,449 --> 00:59:11,190
Help me with this.

765
00:59:11,190 --> 00:59:13,550
I won't die. I won't die.

766
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:16,260
Save me. Save me. Spare me.

767
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:20,500
It's locked. You won't die.

768
00:59:30,969 --> 00:59:33,880
Was it an act from the start? Why?

769
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:39,309
You didn't tell anyone about me,

770
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:42,420
although you had the chance.

771
00:59:44,550 --> 00:59:45,590
Right.

772
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:48,190
The police are curious...

773
00:59:50,329 --> 00:59:51,929
why you tortured me.

774
00:59:56,159 --> 00:59:57,969
Listen to me carefully from now on.

775
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:14,050
I've never seen him cry or smile.

776
01:00:14,050 --> 01:00:16,880
He was always with his dad
at the workshop.

777
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,590
He's not normal, that's for sure.

778
01:00:18,590 --> 01:00:21,090
I had told him
to be wary of Hyun Su.

779
01:00:29,730 --> 01:00:31,969
Mom.

780
01:00:31,969 --> 01:00:34,739
Eun Ha, don't cry. Don't cry.

781
01:00:34,739 --> 01:00:36,869
Don't cry.

782
01:00:37,309 --> 01:00:39,670
I'll give you food.

783
01:00:40,269 --> 01:00:41,840
Hold on. Good girl.

784
01:00:45,679 --> 01:00:48,619
Mom. Mom.

785
01:00:53,789 --> 01:00:56,519
Okay, Eun Ha. Come here.

786
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:59,889
I should stand up to hold you.

787
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,199
Here, have this.

788
01:01:04,769 --> 01:01:06,730
Why did you come out?
Sleep some more.

789
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:26,789
This morning at 9am,
Park Gyung Chun,

790
01:01:26,789 --> 01:01:28,190
the suspect of the Hwesin-dong...

791
01:01:28,190 --> 01:01:30,190
Chinese Restaurant Murder Case
was forwarded to prosecution.

792
01:01:30,659 --> 01:01:34,059
During the police investigation,
Park admitted to murdering...

793
01:01:34,059 --> 01:01:36,630
victim Nam,
as well as abducting, confining,

794
01:01:36,630 --> 01:01:39,429
and attempting to murder
victim Baek.

795
01:01:40,199 --> 01:01:43,239
Park said that he had a grudge
against the police...

796
01:01:43,239 --> 01:01:46,769
because of the result
of the Yeonju Serial Murder Case.

797
01:01:49,639 --> 01:01:51,750
He continues to demand
for a reinvestigation.

798
01:01:52,050 --> 01:01:53,980
Meanwhile,
the Yeonju Serial Murder Case...

799
01:01:56,750 --> 01:01:58,989
Should we start with this first?

800
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:02,789
Wait. Let's ask her this first.

801
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:04,530
Shall we? Okay.

802
01:02:13,670 --> 01:02:16,070
First of all, thank you again...

803
01:02:16,670 --> 01:02:17,969
for bringing up the courage.

804
01:02:19,570 --> 01:02:21,480
It's all thanks to you.

805
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:25,510
Pardon?

806
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:28,619
I forgot about it
and was living well until now.

807
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:32,289
But after I met you,

808
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:36,019
that face keeps on
coming out in my dream.

809
01:02:37,159 --> 01:02:38,530
What face?

810
01:02:40,599 --> 01:02:41,699
Ms. Jung Mi Sook.

811
01:02:44,329 --> 01:02:46,230
She looked at me so desperately.

812
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:49,969
She must...

813
01:02:51,239 --> 01:02:52,610
want me to meet with you.

814
01:02:54,409 --> 01:02:55,980
I'll make sure...

815
01:02:56,780 --> 01:02:59,150
you don't regret coming here today.

816
01:03:00,519 --> 01:03:04,190
Then, let's go back to 2002.

817
01:03:05,349 --> 01:03:09,090
Ms. Jang Young Hee. You witnessed
the abduction of...

818
01:03:09,090 --> 01:03:12,159
Ms. Jung Mi Sook,
the last victim of Do Min Seok.

819
01:03:13,059 --> 01:03:14,199
You also reported it.

820
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:19,429
But later on, you completely changed
your testimony.

821
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:22,369
What was the reason?

822
01:03:41,989 --> 01:03:45,059
Can you tell us what this is?

823
01:03:46,329 --> 01:03:47,400
At the time,

824
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:50,360
I had an answering machine at home.

825
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:53,429
It's the tape from that phone.

826
01:04:00,039 --> 01:04:02,840
- Dad!
- Eun Ha.

827
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:06,079
Gosh.

828
01:04:06,949 --> 01:04:08,380
Did you have fun today too?

829
01:04:08,519 --> 01:04:10,550
- Yes.
- Good job.

830
01:04:10,989 --> 01:04:12,050
Let's go.

831
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:18,429
- Dad. Look at that cloud.
- Yes?

832
01:04:19,530 --> 01:04:20,929
It looks like an egg tart.

833
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:23,860
How cool.

834
01:04:25,869 --> 01:04:28,469
It looks like Mom's face.

835
01:04:29,269 --> 01:04:32,340
No, it doesn't.
It looks like an egg tart.

836
01:04:32,809 --> 01:04:33,909
Does it?

837
01:04:37,909 --> 01:04:41,050
(Soon Gil Chinese Restaurant)

838
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:46,349
I have something to report
about Do Hyun Su.

839
01:04:46,349 --> 01:04:49,389
(Soon Gil Chinese Restaurant)

840
01:04:56,429 --> 01:04:57,500
Do you mean...

841
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:01,199
- this is...
- It's Do Hyun Su's bag.

842
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:04,269
I found it while cleaning up
the restaurant.

843
01:05:05,539 --> 01:05:06,969
I looked inside.

844
01:05:07,510 --> 01:05:09,710
I think my husband kept it...

845
01:05:09,710 --> 01:05:11,980
just in case Do Hyun Su
comes back...

846
01:05:12,550 --> 01:05:14,050
to take it.

847
01:05:21,889 --> 01:05:23,719
He wasn't caught for 18 years.

848
01:05:24,389 --> 01:05:26,260
Do you think you'll be able
to catch him with this?

849
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:31,599
I'll catch him.

850
01:05:43,409 --> 01:05:44,449
Lady.

851
01:05:45,349 --> 01:05:46,949
Don't meddle.

852
01:05:48,179 --> 01:05:50,219
You're not the only one who saw me.

853
01:05:50,889 --> 01:05:52,619
I saw you too.

854
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:56,219
You have a small red car.

855
01:05:58,059 --> 01:06:00,059
I know where you work and live too.

856
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:04,769
You should watch yourself
when you have kids.

857
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:08,739
Hey lady,

858
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:11,909
have you heard of the Gagyeong-ri
Village Foreman Murder Case?

859
01:06:13,610 --> 01:06:15,340
Do you know why he died?

860
01:06:17,380 --> 01:06:18,750
Because he meddled...

861
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:23,679
when he's a nobody.
He didn't know his place.

862
01:06:25,119 --> 01:06:28,460
Knowing that such a heinous man
is roaming around freely...

863
01:06:29,590 --> 01:06:30,789
really scares me.

864
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:34,460
No one has ever seen it.

865
01:06:35,559 --> 01:06:36,699
Pardon?

866
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:38,400
I looked at the case record,

867
01:06:39,199 --> 01:06:42,969
and no one has seen Do Hyun Su
do anything heinous...

868
01:06:43,639 --> 01:06:45,010
in person.

869
01:06:46,610 --> 01:06:48,340
My husband told me...

870
01:06:48,809 --> 01:06:50,539
Do Hyun Su isn't like other people.

871
01:06:51,050 --> 01:06:53,750
He said since he wasn't normal,
he was unpredictable...

872
01:06:53,750 --> 01:06:54,949
and that made him scary.

873
01:06:58,019 --> 01:06:59,320
Psychopaths...

874
01:07:00,389 --> 01:07:03,590
can't take care of those
who are weaker than them.

875
01:07:05,159 --> 01:07:07,860
However, Do Hyun Su raised a dog
and its puppies...

876
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:10,460
for about ten years.

877
01:07:12,170 --> 01:07:13,269
That's a fact.

878
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:15,699
He's on the run
after killing someone.

879
01:07:15,869 --> 01:07:18,239
He's a murderer. That's a fact.

880
01:07:18,670 --> 01:07:21,510
You're right. That's also a fact.

881
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:25,650
But I want to find out more...

882
01:07:26,449 --> 01:07:29,480
because one should only suffer
as much as one deserves.

883
01:07:31,219 --> 01:07:33,050
Whether it be through
legal punishment...

884
01:07:34,889 --> 01:07:36,420
or having to deal
with emotional pain.

885
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:42,260
That's why I need to find out
more truths.

886
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:44,869
I want...

887
01:07:47,739 --> 01:07:49,369
to punish him properly.

888
01:07:49,869 --> 01:07:52,340
If you read
the stories about him online...

889
01:07:52,409 --> 01:07:54,510
And when it comes to investigations,
this is my conviction.

890
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:56,940
I only believe...

891
01:07:58,210 --> 01:07:59,880
what I see.

892
01:08:33,079 --> 01:08:37,489
=Flower of Evil=

893
01:08:37,689 --> 01:08:40,789
Do Hyun Su lived as Baek Hee Seong
for at least 14 years.

894
01:08:40,789 --> 01:08:43,189
And the latter's parents
cooperated voluntarily.

895
01:08:43,689 --> 01:08:46,989
What do you think
would've happened...

896
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:49,199
if the police considered
the possibility...

897
01:08:49,199 --> 01:08:51,000
of Do Hyun Su and Do Min Seok
being accomplices to each other...

898
01:08:51,199 --> 01:08:52,829
when investigating the kidnapping
of Jung Mi Sook?

899
01:08:52,829 --> 01:08:55,500
You have to believe me.

900
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:58,510
This is the result
of you breaking your promise.

901
01:08:58,909 --> 01:09:01,310
How can I trust you?

902
01:09:02,279 --> 01:09:03,710
I'm going to catch...

903
01:09:04,079 --> 01:09:05,079
Do Hyun Su.
