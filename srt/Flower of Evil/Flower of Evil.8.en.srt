(Fall of 2005)

10
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,259
I get three meals a day,
and the bed is comfortable.

11
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:57,899
I feel cozy being confined here.

12
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,530
You're quite the bold type,
aren't you?

13
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:04,099
I like that.

14
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:07,170
I have a question.

15
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,640
Anything.

16
00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:12,180
I'm the one who got hit,

17
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:15,209
so why is the driver unconscious?

18
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,500
It's the same reason why
you've become a runaway.

19
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,799
An incident
that no one had intended occurred.

20
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:43,980
If I live as him,

21
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,849
what kind of benefit
will you two receive?

22
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:00,659
We've lost our son,
but I'd like to protect the rest.

23
00:02:02,329 --> 00:02:04,359
My wife and myself.

24
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,500
Last week,

25
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,569
I became the chief of surgery.

26
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,180
Do you know what that means?

27
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:22,849
If they find out about your son,

28
00:02:23,949 --> 00:02:26,180
you might lose your position.

29
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,090
Correct.

30
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:31,189
What if I refuse?

31
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,460
What will you do with me?

32
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,830
Isn't it obvious what'll happen
even if I don't take part?

33
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:48,310
You'll be put behind bars,
and I'll hit rock bottom.

34
00:02:55,949 --> 00:02:57,319
What do you need me to do?

35
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,960
This contains everything
about my son's past.

36
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,030
He got discharged from the military
last year...

37
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,400
and was studying at an academy
to get into college.

38

(Certificate of Award,
Baek Hee Seong)

39
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,800
Take a look at his social media...

40
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:17,169
to see what kinds of people
he had around him.

41
00:03:17,169 --> 00:03:18,699
("My Smart Boy")

42
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:23,069
You can gradually cut ties
with them.

43
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,580
But the real problem...

44
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:30,819
is this.

48
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:07,819
It's acting up again.

49
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:10,319
I'm sorry. Could you do it again?

50
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,289
The machine acts up
3 out of 10 times.

51
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,159
I have a busy schedule today.

52
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:16,629
Do I need to keep wrestling
with this stupid machine?

53
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:21,569
Then let me ask you a few questions.

54
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,339
What are your parents' names?

55
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,540
Baek Man Woo and Gong Mi Ja.

56
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,279

57
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:37,220

00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:44,959
I'll print out
the reissue confirmation document.

60

You're so brazen.

65
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,250
I can't help but think
that you're really brazen.

66
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,220
You want me to find Hae Su?

67
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:13,750
Why should I do that?

68

Ji Won...

69
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:22,759
wants to catch Do Hyun Su.

70
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:25,899
What? Why all of a sudden?

71
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,699
Because you made him...

72
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:31,199
an accomplice
of a serial murder case.

73
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:38,810
Do you truly think
that I was my father's accomplice?

74
00:05:40,509 --> 00:05:41,610
So...

75
00:05:43,579 --> 00:05:45,319
You really think
you can catch the real culprit?

76
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:47,689
How?

77
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,019
Why are you looking for your sister?

78
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:06,040
She has met the accomplice before.

79
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:13,279
If you help me,
I'll tell you everything I know.

80
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:15,379
Who knows?

81
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:19,379
You might be the very person
who'll reveal the identity...

82
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,819
of the Yeonju Serial Murder Case's
accomplice.

83

Kim Mu Jin?

84
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,240
He went there at this hour?

85
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,509
Why? What's he up to?

86
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,100
- Where have you been?
- What?

87
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,500
I woke you up, didn't I?

88
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,310
I couldn't sleep,
so I went to the workshop.

89
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,740
Liar.

90
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:23,550
I can smell
your car's air freshener.

91
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,189
Why are you mad?

92
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:37,899
"Mad"? I'm not mad.

93
00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:42,870
Oh, I thought you were.

94
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,480
I took some stuff out of the car.

95
00:07:52,779 --> 00:07:54,610
I bought some materials
yesterday morning.

96
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:05,459
Face this way.

97
00:08:16,769 --> 00:08:19,269
- Happy?
- Yes.

98
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:50,200
He was in his workshop
from the morning until 3pm.

99
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:03,850
Are you sure sitting here
will solve the lettuce robbery case?

100
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,019
That's how those kids do it.

101
00:09:07,289 --> 00:09:09,350
They make a newbie
commit something trivial...

102
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,990
then let him join for the real deal.

103
00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:13,720
Trust me and be patient.

104
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:33,950
Okay. The man finally has his eyes
on a prey.

105
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,580
Ji Won, six o'clock.

106
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,080
Keep your eyes on the woman
in her 20s with stripes.

107
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:40,419
Got it.

108
00:09:40,419 --> 00:09:42,250
- We'll keep our eyes on the boys.
- Okay.

109
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:44,559
We need to catch the newbie...

110
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:47,120
in order to catch the real man
for inciting the robbery, got it?

111
00:09:47,789 --> 00:09:48,860
Okay.

112
00:10:08,549 --> 00:10:09,649
- Let's go.
- Okay.

113
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,320
Are you sure that's yours?

114
00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:23,629
In Seo? It's you, right?

115
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,159
What are you doing here?

116
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:34,269
In Seo!

117
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,210
- Don't follow me!
- I won't.

118
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:39,110
Let's just talk.

119
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:40,950
Let's go home first.

120
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,710
Your mother must be worried.

121
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:44,649
I've ruined everything.

122
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:49,549
My mom, dad, and our family.
It's all my fault.

123
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,159
What?

124
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:56,529
I know there's a reason
why you lied.

125
00:10:58,029 --> 00:10:59,629
So I thought...

126
00:11:01,169 --> 00:11:03,029
if my dad was mean to me,

127
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:06,799
my mom wouldn't be so sad.

128
00:11:08,409 --> 00:11:09,669
I'm sorry.

129
00:11:10,309 --> 00:11:11,580
I regret it so much.

130
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,879
I should've pretended
not to know anything.

131
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,299
After my husband was arrested,

132
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:36,769
it hit In Seo hard emotionally.

133
00:11:38,169 --> 00:11:41,909
I think it was too hard for him
to be with me.

134
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:46,009
He kept thinking of his dad.

135
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:54,519
The police kept telling me to wait.

136
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,659
I think I might...

137
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,590
really die from waiting.

138
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:04,429
For runaway cases,
there's nothing you can do...

139
00:12:04,429 --> 00:12:05,600
but wait...

140
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,759
You should check...

141
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,799
the internet cafe near the
five-way intersection...

142
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:09,970
in Bangjeong-dong.

143
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:14,909
Okay, then. I better get going.

144
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:16,970
Goodbye.

145
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:24,009
Do you think In Seo will still be
in that neighborhood?

146
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:25,679
Even the police are involved now.

147
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,320
It's not that, Ji Won just said that
to keep her preoccupied.

148
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,649
Good job.

149
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,360
If In Seo...

150
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:35,659
just buried that secret,

151
00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:39,659
don't you think their family
would be better off right now?

152
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:43,029
How could someone bury something
that they already know?

153
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,340
Because...

154
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,309
there could be
so many good memories.

155
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,509
Anything bad may disappear
with time.

156
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,480
If it were you,

157
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:56,149
are you sure you won't be doubtful
of those good memories?

158
00:12:57,409 --> 00:13:01,250
Are you sure you won't
continuously doubt if it was true?

159
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:06,019
Living like that will be
more miserable.

160
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:08,690
We're having
a team gathering tonight.

161
00:13:12,929 --> 00:13:16,299
Wrap up all your current cases
by this week.

162
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,899
Our team has been chosen!

163
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,539
The reinvestigation of the
Yeonju Serial Murder Case, right?

164
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:23,809
Really? For real?

165
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:38,820
I believe Do Hyun Su
is still doing metal crafting.

166
00:13:39,889 --> 00:13:42,690
Even a layman could see
that he was very talented.

167
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:56,470
(Kim Mu Jin)

168
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:01,549
What?

169
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:04,220
I found Do Hae Su.

170
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:08,490
Already?

171
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:09,889
You know how good I am.

172
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:17,389
Did you keep in touch
with my sister all this time?

173
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:18,759
It's 7pm tonight.

174
00:14:19,429 --> 00:14:20,830
I'll send you the location later.

175
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:23,600
Okay.

176
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,100
And...

177
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,269
There's something else
you need to find out.

178
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:32,409
What would you have done without me?

179
00:14:33,409 --> 00:14:36,179
I looked into Jung Mi Sook's case,
and there was something odd.

180
00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:39,480
After fighting with her husband,
she packed up and left.

181
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,149
But why did Park Gyung Chun
report her missing?

182
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,519
You have a point.

183
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:49,730
Go talk to Park Gyung Chun.
If you mention me, he'll cooperate.

184
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:53,659
By the way,
aren't you going to thank me?

185
00:14:54,669 --> 00:14:56,399
Hello? Hey...

186
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,570
So this is how you'll play?

187
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:03,309
I might look into how much
I'll be paid if I report you.

188
00:15:04,539 --> 00:15:05,909
Let's call it a day.

189
00:15:06,309 --> 00:15:07,440
Remember to finish up.

190
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:08,710
- Okay.
- Okay.

191
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,980
- Thank you.
- Bye.

192
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,590
Thank you.

193
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,500
Hyun Su is innocent. It was all me.

194
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:32,740
I killed him.

195
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:42,580
How could you...

196
00:15:44,149 --> 00:15:46,980
just say what you wanted to say
and leave?

197
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,519
I'm sorry.

198
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,389
What?

199
00:15:52,889 --> 00:15:54,990
Oh, I wasn't asking you
to apologize.

200
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,590
I really wanted you to know.

201
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:59,000
Since that's the truth.

202
00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:01,100
Okay.

203
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,470
That's why I came...

204
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,070
to drop a bomb on you too.

205
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,450
I'm already prepared.

206
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:17,679
Since that day, I have never lived
a day in peace.

207
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,389
I found Do Hyun Su.

208
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,159
You know how good I am.

209
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,269
About the reinvestigation of the
Yeonju Serial Murder Case.

210
00:16:37,169 --> 00:16:39,000
You may already know,

211
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,009
but the headquarter wants our team
to head it.

212
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,980
What do you think?

213
00:16:45,139 --> 00:16:46,279
Of course, we should do it.

214
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:47,809
We solved Park Gyung Chun's
case too.

215
00:16:47,809 --> 00:16:48,879
Right, Ji Won?

216
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:52,179
Is it a good thing for us
to head it?

217
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,820
I'm not sure.

218
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:56,519
We'll be going after
a serial murderer.

219
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:57,720
What's there to think about?

220
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,919
I'm against it.

221
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,860
Compared to how much attention
it's receiving nationally,

222
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,700
the possibility of us succeeding
is too low.

223
00:17:06,029 --> 00:17:07,500
You're so naive.

224
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,430
Once we head it,
we'll produce results.

225
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:11,599
There's no key suspect
we can focus on,

226
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,799
and it's almost been 20 years,

227
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,869
so any evidence or witnesses
will be gone.

228
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,779
Why isn't there a suspect?
There's Do Hyun Su.

229
00:17:20,509 --> 00:17:22,480
Being obsessed with a ghost
like him...

230
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,119
means there's no actual lead
that we can investigate.

231
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:27,119
You were even wiretapped
by Park Gyung Chun...

232
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,619
because you mentioned
Do Hyun Su so much.

233
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:34,160
Do you really have to bring up
someone's mistake like that again?

234
00:17:35,089 --> 00:17:38,160
Anyhow, I'm saying that
we're already too biased...

235
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,829
because of Park Gyung Chun's case.

236
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:42,569
We can't view this case
from a new perspective.

237
00:17:43,569 --> 00:17:45,940
Give this to another team, okay?

238
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,180
What?

239
00:17:53,609 --> 00:17:55,849
This doesn't sound like you.

240
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,180
Actually, I also thought you'd be
the happiest...

241
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,490
if I mentioned the reinvestigation.

242
00:18:03,089 --> 00:18:05,789
I'm just saying we should make
a reasonable choice.

243
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:08,759
You're acting strange lately.

244
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:11,329
You keep getting distracted...

245
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:13,730
and leave without saying anything.

246
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,930
You're not even interested
in our investigation.

247
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:17,670
Are you...

248
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,509
Are you digging into another case
on your own?

249
00:18:25,009 --> 00:18:26,710
- What?
- Really?

250
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,309
You kept it hidden from us?

251
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,480
Detective Cha,
that's upsetting to hear.

252
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:32,319
Are you at the initial stage
of investigating?

253
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,049
No.

254
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:36,450
How could I do that?
That's not true.

255
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,990
Hey, stop making it so obvious.

256
00:18:42,259 --> 00:18:43,690
Who is it? An informant?

257
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,759
Ji Won, we caught you.

258
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,430
Stop it. Let's respect her secret.

259
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:53,369
It's my husband.

260
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,509
I'm going to be late today.

261
00:18:59,509 --> 00:19:02,509
Do you remember the director
from the art museum?

262
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:04,410
Oh, the one who wants to hold
an exhibition?

263
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,279
I thought you refused.

264
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:10,890
Yes, but he kept calling me,
so we met.

265
00:19:11,259 --> 00:19:12,259
It's taking longer than I thought.

266
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,490
Are you drinking?

267
00:19:15,329 --> 00:19:16,490
Just a little.

268
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,759
Don't drink too much.

269
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,559
- Okay.
- Bye.

270
00:19:35,009 --> 00:19:36,210
He's lying again.

271
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,789
(Marronnier Beer)

272
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:26,390
I didn't want...

273
00:21:28,059 --> 00:21:29,329
to ever look for you again.

274
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,170
But there's a problem...

275
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:40,470
and I need your help.

276
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:47,240
You met someone
during Father's funeral.

277
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:50,180
They gave you a fish keychain...

278
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:42,769
Did you do this to him?

279
00:22:45,339 --> 00:22:46,670
I came to see the village foreman...

280
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:51,269
to ask him to stop making you...

281
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,980
go through exorcism.

282
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,779
But he suddenly...

283
00:22:58,119 --> 00:22:59,450
He suddenly tried to...

284
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,259
Hyun Su.

285
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:17,569
Hyun Su, you can't do this.

286
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:21,910
Hand that to me.

287
00:23:24,509 --> 00:23:25,880
You shouldn't do this.

288
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:30,750
Hae Su, I feel quite good.

289
00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:34,680
I really do.

290
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:37,390
Hyun Su.

291
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,059
I want you to live a normal life.

292
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,490
Live your best.

293
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,460
My life's already ruined,

294
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:49,230
so it's okay.

295
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,450
Have you been well?

296
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,650
How can you ask me that?

297
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,619
How can I live well
after sending you off like that?

298
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:18,500
You should resent me
for eating well and sleeping well.

299
00:24:19,329 --> 00:24:22,869
You fool. How can you ask me
if I have been well?

300
00:24:32,509 --> 00:24:33,609
Don't be mistaken.

301
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,750
I made all the choices.

302
00:25:07,809 --> 00:25:10,809
I can't believe what kind of things
you're making me do.

303
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:28,299
Try it.

304
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,069
It's been a while, so I can't
guarantee it'll taste good.

305
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,980
What is this?
Are you asking me to feed you?

306
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:44,250
I'm not very good
with chopsticks yet.

307
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:48,890
Are you serious?

308
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,230
You have to blow on it and cool it
before you give it to me.

309
00:26:03,769 --> 00:26:05,970
You're slaving me.

310
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,849
How does it taste?

311
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,759
I said, how does it taste?

312
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:28,930
Does it taste bad?

313
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:32,160
It tastes better than Mom's.

314
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,299
Really?

315
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:38,839
But Dad's is even better.

316
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,470
You're young but you know
how to play hard to get.

317
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:01,359
What are you doing right now?

318
00:27:05,059 --> 00:27:07,829
What kept you so busy
you didn't know I was coming home?

319
00:27:08,769 --> 00:27:12,200
Well, I...

320
00:27:13,869 --> 00:27:16,539
Eun Ha, say hello to Grandpa.

321
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,579
Hello.

322
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:23,779
Hello. Have fun.

323
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,849
We need to talk.

324
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:54,740
How can you let someone
in the house?

325
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,910
Are you out of your mind?

326
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,220
Do you even think?

327
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,119
She's a child.

328
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:05,420
I just let a six-year-old
come in and fed her.

329
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:07,420
Do I deserve this kind of scolding?

330
00:28:08,789 --> 00:28:12,759
Don't you feel sorry for Hee Seong?

331
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:17,470
He's bedridden in this house.

332
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,470
How can you laugh and chat here?

333
00:28:19,569 --> 00:28:23,470
You want me to live like a sinner
for the rest of my life, don't you?

334
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:25,740
I also...

335
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:29,309
want to live like other people.

336
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:32,779
Then you shouldn't have allowed
that to happen to Hee Seong!

337
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:41,390
Watching a child eat
in this house...

338
00:28:42,329 --> 00:28:44,460
and having the house
smell like food again...

339
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,430
made me tear up.

340
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:53,039
Your depression is back.

341
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,039
You need to see a doctor.

342
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,839
What did you say?

343
00:29:05,549 --> 00:29:07,779
Ma'am, I have to pee.

344
00:29:16,259 --> 00:29:18,599
Ma'am, I said I have to pee.

345
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,180
What?

346
00:30:15,589 --> 00:30:16,920
Hee Seong...

347
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:19,220
is lying in that room
every single day.

348
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:22,289
He can't smell anything...

349
00:30:22,829 --> 00:30:26,359
and is only fed
some tasteless rice gruel.

350
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:29,170
And yet,

351
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:33,970
you got teary-eyed
after smelling some food?

352
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,710
How could you call yourself
his mother?

353
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:43,849
Where were you...

354
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:47,019
when Hee Seong first learned
how to walk?

355
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:51,890
When Hee Seong
could finally write his name,

356
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,759
where were you?

357
00:30:56,089 --> 00:30:59,160
When he was hospitalized
for pneumonia, attended contests,

358
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,460
and won awards,

359
00:31:01,329 --> 00:31:02,700
where were you?

360
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:05,769
- That's enough.
- Where were you...

361
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:08,970
when he got into the car accident
and was looking for you?

362
00:31:09,269 --> 00:31:11,609
Why didn't you pick up
your phone that day?

363
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:15,750
I did my very best.

364
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,980
You mean managing
to keep him breathing in there?

365
00:31:18,549 --> 00:31:20,279
Was that for him?

366
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:21,750
Or me?

367
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:22,990
No.

368
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:25,390
That was all for you.

369
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:31,190
You're the only one
who is living a sane life.

370
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:33,700
I'm going crazy,

371
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:36,269
and Hee Seong is as good as dead.

372
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:37,630
Do you think he's living right now?

373
00:31:38,099 --> 00:31:40,869
If he could talk,
he would've begged us...

374
00:31:40,869 --> 00:31:42,039
to kill him...

375
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:54,579
I'm sorry.

376
00:31:56,119 --> 00:31:58,019
I couldn't control my emotions.

377
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:03,490
See?

378
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,200
This is your limit.

379
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,630
A slight poke to your wound,

380
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:13,569
and your dignified mask...

381
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,509
came off just like that.

382
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,319
I need to pee,

383
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:32,559
but I can't find the bathroom.

384
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,859
A mere six-year-old...

385
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,470
was roaming around our house.

386
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,170
Make sure she doesn't say anything.

387
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:09,390
Let's go.
I'll take you to the bathroom.

388
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:15,230
You should go home too.

389
00:33:29,009 --> 00:33:30,049
You're crying again?

390
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:35,019
I'm just really happy.

391
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:38,650
What's her name?

392
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:40,789
Baek Eun Ha.

393
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:42,730
"Baek Hee Seong".

394
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:45,059
"Baek Eun Ha".

395
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:49,430
Look at this.

396
00:33:53,099 --> 00:33:54,170
Don't they look the same?

397
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:56,970
They have similar personalities too.

398
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:01,940
She's not like me. I'm certain.

399
00:34:03,009 --> 00:34:05,109
I checked continuously
as I was raising her.

400
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:07,849
Hyun Su.

401
00:34:11,619 --> 00:34:13,320
You've changed a lot.

402
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,530
What?

403
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:18,960
Did you think I wouldn't age?

404
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:22,429
That's not what I meant.

405
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:28,139
Hae Su.

406
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:31,170
I didn't worry about you.

407
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:34,280
I only thought about myself.

408
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:40,550
I only looked for you this time...

409
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:41,949
because I needed help.

410
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:43,920
I'll help you in any way I can.

411
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:52,360
Father had an accomplice.

412
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:57,530
I'm sure you've met them before.

413
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,969
I've met the accomplice?

414
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:06,480
You two even spoke to each other.

415
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,010
I think it was during
Father's funeral.

416
00:35:18,289 --> 00:35:20,590
The fish keychain
you had given me...

417
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:25,559
belonged to Jung Mi Sook,
his last victim.

418
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,500
What?

419
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,239
He's looking for the accomplice.

420
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:39,280
It wasn't him.

421
00:35:40,579 --> 00:35:43,880
That's why Park Gyung Chun,
her husband,

422
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:47,250
mistook me for the accomplice
and did what he did.

423
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,519
It's true that he and Gyung Chun
made a deal.

424
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:53,619
That's why he didn't say anything
about Hyun Su.

425
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:59,460
The police visited me
because of that case.

426
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,369
Back then, I had no idea...

427
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:07,639
Ms. Do Hae Su?

428
00:36:08,269 --> 00:36:10,510
I'm Detective Cha,
the one who called.

429
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:14,079
Hyun Su.

430
00:36:14,809 --> 00:36:16,010
Your wife...

431
00:36:18,449 --> 00:36:19,719
isn't...

432
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:24,320
No, right?

433
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,960
You're right. She's a detective.

434
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:36,599
She was in charge
of Park Gyung Chun's case.

435
00:36:39,969 --> 00:36:41,599
I'm walking on eggshells here.

436
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:44,409
A single mistake isn't allowed.

437
00:36:47,309 --> 00:36:48,440
Don't worry.

438
00:36:49,349 --> 00:36:50,809
I won't make any mistakes.

439
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:58,519
I'm going to live as Baek Hee Seong
until I die.

440
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:03,289
Do...

441
00:37:04,329 --> 00:37:05,389
you...

442
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:09,730
love her?

443
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:20,210
No.

444
00:37:22,809 --> 00:37:26,380
I've never loved her.

445
00:37:29,619 --> 00:37:31,019
I don't know how to love.

446
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,210
You should've expected that.

447
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,940
What were you thinking?

448
00:39:10,449 --> 00:39:12,460
(Mom)

449
00:39:20,829 --> 00:39:21,960
Eun Ha.

450
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,030
She picked up.

451
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,739
Mom, Dad isn't picking up.

452
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,539
I wanted to show him my drawing.

453
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:32,909
Show it to me then.

454
00:39:33,909 --> 00:39:36,610
Ta-da. It's our house.

455
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,449
What a lovely drawing.

456
00:39:41,449 --> 00:39:42,489
Eun Ha.

457
00:39:42,989 --> 00:39:44,150
Yes?

458
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:49,659
I love you very, very much.

459
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:55,329
Me too. I love you, Mom.

460
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:57,269
How much?

461
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:01,440
As much as the sky and earth.

462
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,639
As much as Dad!

463
00:40:06,809 --> 00:40:08,840
Gosh, how cute is she?

464
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:11,949
Remember to eat,
and don't skip your meals, okay?

465
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:06,900
Fine. I'll let you live
as Baek Hee Seong.

466
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:47,710
What are you doing here alone?

467
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:49,380
Do you want to join me?

468
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:55,920
What about Eun Ha?

469
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:58,989
She's sleeping. She fell asleep
as soon as we came home.

470
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:10,630
Is something wrong?

471
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:15,269
It's just been a long day.

472
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:21,110
Why? What is it?

473
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:26,250
It's nothing much. You know,

474
00:42:27,619 --> 00:42:30,650
when you start something you like
and cling onto it,

475
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:35,190
but you don't get the results
you want, and it's upsetting.

476
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:43,699
Shall I quit?

477
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:48,670
Shall I stop?

478
00:42:52,539 --> 00:42:54,480
Stop if it's too hard.

479
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:00,480
You make it sound like
it's so easy.

480
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:04,820
I don't want you to suffer.

481
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:07,019
Live like your true self.

482
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,760
What's my true self like?

483
00:43:13,829 --> 00:43:17,730
You're bright, pure,
and you smile often.

484
00:43:19,099 --> 00:43:22,000
You get angry easily and sulk too.

485
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:23,769
But you forget soon.

486
00:43:25,139 --> 00:43:26,579
I'm gullible too.

487
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:31,679
You know I have an innocent side
to me.

488
00:43:33,349 --> 00:43:34,349
You do?

489
00:43:35,949 --> 00:43:37,619
Come on, that's not true.

490
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:43,860
Time really flies by, doesn't it?

491
00:43:44,889 --> 00:43:47,800
Next week will be five years
since we moved into this house.

492
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,699
From the sofa, bed, closet,

493
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:56,110
shoe rack, wallpaper, and
even the slippers.

494
00:43:56,110 --> 00:43:58,409
We chose, made,
and fixed everything together.

495
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:00,610
We had so much fun.

496
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:04,250
We even had a party.

497
00:44:06,949 --> 00:44:08,780
I was so happy that day.

498
00:44:11,889 --> 00:44:14,360
Do you want to do it again?
Our fifth-anniversary party?

499
00:44:16,289 --> 00:44:18,289
I'll prepare everything...

500
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,599
so you can just enjoy it.

501
00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:27,739
Do you love me?

502
00:44:45,289 --> 00:44:46,889
Why are you asking something
so obvious?

503
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:57,469
Keep living as Baek Hee Seong...

504
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:00,070
for Eun Ha's sake.

505
00:45:02,469 --> 00:45:05,369
Let's feign ignorance
and go our separate ways...

506
00:45:07,309 --> 00:45:09,010
as Baek Hee Seong and Cha Ji Won.

507
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:14,079
This is my last gift to you.

508
00:45:19,989 --> 00:45:23,559
By the way, our team will lead
the reinvestigation.

509
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:26,230
The Yeonju Serial Murder Case.

510
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:30,599
I'll become really busy.

511
00:45:31,429 --> 00:45:33,039
I'm going to give it all I've got.

512
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:45,980
Please try to remember, Hae Su.

513
00:45:48,519 --> 00:45:49,920
During Father's funeral,

514
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:53,320
I didn't see anyone
who cried as much as that person.

515
00:46:01,429 --> 00:46:03,369
I can't remember his face at all.

516
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:07,539
There's nothing that particularly
stood out.

517
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:12,940
He told me he owed Father a debt.

518
00:46:14,679 --> 00:46:16,610
That's why he wanted to give it
to me.

519
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:20,449
He said it was a precious item
that brought fortune.

520
00:46:23,719 --> 00:46:27,489
His voice sounded so kind.

521
00:46:28,659 --> 00:46:30,230
I almost teared up.

522
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:32,630
Thank you.

523
00:46:35,099 --> 00:46:36,230
But...

524
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:39,739
he looked at you sleeping
for quite a while and said,

525
00:46:41,239 --> 00:46:42,769
"That's Do Hyun Su, right?"

526
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:45,869
"I feel so sorry for him."

527
00:46:47,639 --> 00:46:49,610
"I can't imagine how unfortunate
he'll be in the future."

528
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:55,480
When I heard that,

529
00:46:56,619 --> 00:46:58,690
I decided to give that chain to you.

530
00:47:05,389 --> 00:47:07,260
He approached me intentionally.

531
00:47:10,599 --> 00:47:11,929
Who on earth is it?

532
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:14,500
Oh, there's one more thing.

533
00:47:15,639 --> 00:47:17,610
I suddenly remembered this
while I was watching...

534
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:19,210
the witness interview.

535
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:24,010
He told me he would help me
if I called him...

536
00:47:24,679 --> 00:47:27,179
when I had no one left
to rely on...

537
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:31,789
and felt like there's no hope
whatsoever.

538
00:47:33,159 --> 00:47:34,219
The phone number.

539
00:47:36,429 --> 00:47:37,489
Did you write it down?

540
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:40,659
The phone number...

541
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:42,969
I wrote it down back then.

542
00:47:45,099 --> 00:47:46,699
But our house burnt down.

543
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,739
Hey, why did you do something
so foolish...

544
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:53,610
After Hyun Su left,
I had to burn everything...

545
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:55,309
he left behind...

546
00:47:56,179 --> 00:47:57,579
including my bloody school uniform.

547
00:47:58,449 --> 00:48:00,650
Oh, I see.

548
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:03,719
Then next is...

549
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:09,460
The witness from August 21, 2002.

550
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:13,860
The threatening call.

551
00:48:21,469 --> 00:48:23,639
Here, listen to this.

552
00:48:24,409 --> 00:48:26,510
You're not the only one who saw me.

553
00:48:27,079 --> 00:48:28,780
I saw you too.

554
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:32,079
Focus on the sound in the background
rather than his voice.

555
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:37,889
Have you heard of the Gagyeong-ri
Village Foreman Murder Case?

556
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:41,659
- Right here, this sound.
- Do you know why he died?

557
00:48:41,789 --> 00:48:42,820
Do you hear it?

558
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:45,329
- Yes.
- Because he meddled...

559
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:48,400
What does it sound like?

560
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,099
I'm not sure.

561
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:54,170
Isn't it coming from a workshop?

562
00:48:55,869 --> 00:48:56,909
No.

563
00:48:57,670 --> 00:48:59,679
I'm certain I heard it before.

564
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:05,449
I think I've been to this place.

565
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:12,219
- Kim Mu Jin.
- Why are you so beautiful?

566
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:14,320
What?

567
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:16,559
- What?
- What did you just say?

568
00:49:18,829 --> 00:49:20,699
What did I say?
I didn't say anything.

569
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,260
You just said something to me.

570
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:30,739
There's something
I must seriously tell you.

571
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,969
Pay attention to me for a moment.

572
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:37,610
I don't ever want to be in another
muddy relationship with you guys.

573
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:40,820
Let's keep it professional
and only focus on work.

574
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:42,079
Okay?

575
00:49:43,289 --> 00:49:46,119
We're gathered here because
we have a common goal.

576
00:49:46,119 --> 00:49:49,159
We want to catch the accomplice
of the Yeonju Serial Murder Case.

577
00:49:49,559 --> 00:49:53,030
Once we finish the job,
it's over for us too.

578
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:54,659
Forever.

579
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:56,730
Okay.

580
00:49:57,929 --> 00:49:58,969
Okay?

581
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,800
I... Yes.

582
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:04,340
I'm glad.

583
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:07,980
- Kim Mu Jin.
- What? Did I say something wrong?

584
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:10,179
What did Park Gyung Chun say?

585
00:50:11,579 --> 00:50:13,880
- What?
- You met Park Gyung Chun.

586
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,719
Gosh,
we're even getting a new office.

587
00:50:18,289 --> 00:50:20,059
It's so cozy and nice.

588
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:21,659
Everything changed.

589
00:50:22,159 --> 00:50:23,460
Gosh.

590
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:29,230
This will make me want to work.

591
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:37,840
(Yes! Our 5th anniversary
at our house!)

592
00:50:39,269 --> 00:50:41,880
Is it the fifth-year anniversary
since you bought your house?

593
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:44,849
Do you celebrate
something like that too?

594
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:46,949
I'm so jealous.

595
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:49,820
They always look like
they're newlyweds.

596
00:50:49,849 --> 00:50:52,219
When I get married,
I want to live like you.

597
00:50:52,789 --> 00:50:55,590
You have to find a good person
if you want to live like me.

598
00:50:56,690 --> 00:50:59,760
Hey, I heard Detective Choi told you
to break up before you got married.

599
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:04,199
Hey. People can make mistakes.

600
00:51:04,199 --> 00:51:07,440
It makes them more humane that way.

601
00:51:08,469 --> 00:51:10,510
Just like when you were bugged?

602
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:11,510
Are you kidding me?

603
00:51:11,539 --> 00:51:13,840
Hurry up and get organized
so we can start working.

604
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:15,210
Yes, sir.

605
00:51:31,329 --> 00:51:33,559
May 9th.
After a fight with her husband,

606
00:51:33,559 --> 00:51:35,730
Jung Mi Sook ran away from home.

607
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:41,599
On May 11th at 7pm,
the 3rd day away from home,

608
00:51:42,369 --> 00:51:44,710
Jung Mi Sook talked
to Park Gyung Chun on the phone...

609
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:46,940
at the bus station
in Yongsan Station.

610
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,449
At this time, Park Gyung Chun
coincidentally got into an accident,

611
00:51:50,610 --> 00:51:53,110
and he was hospitalized.

612
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:56,079
Jung Mi Sook who was surprised to
find out about the car accident...

613
00:51:56,219 --> 00:51:58,820
asked him where the hospital room is
and hung up in a hurry.

614
00:52:00,519 --> 00:52:03,730
Right after that,
she was out of reach.

615
00:52:04,429 --> 00:52:07,230
Do you think she was abducted
on her way to the hospital?

616
00:52:10,099 --> 00:52:11,130
No.

617
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:13,030
That's not like Father.

618
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:14,639
It's too reckless.

619
00:52:16,099 --> 00:52:19,039
Father hated
unpredictable situations.

620
00:52:19,710 --> 00:52:21,610
Right.
I was going to talk about this.

621
00:52:23,010 --> 00:52:25,280
There's something I newly learned...

622
00:52:25,349 --> 00:52:27,050
while rereading the articles
from that time.

623
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:30,590
There was something in common
among the victims.

624
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:33,360
When you look at it like this,

625
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:36,159
I don't think
they have anything in common.

626
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:37,329
That's not true.

627
00:52:38,190 --> 00:52:39,559
All the victims...

628
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:43,199
suddenly disappeared from the world,
but no one looked for them.

629
00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:44,670
Do Min Seok died at the time,

630
00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:47,070
so they didn't investigate
about the victims in detail.

631
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:50,909
You can say that we have close
to no information on the victims.

632
00:52:51,909 --> 00:52:53,170
Except for Jung Mi Sook.

633
00:52:53,239 --> 00:52:55,340
Thanks to Park Gyung Chun
reporting her missing,

634
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:57,079
we have a record of her movements...

635
00:52:57,079 --> 00:52:59,210
up to just before
her disappearance on May 11th, 2002.

636
00:53:00,050 --> 00:53:01,780
Ho Joon,
put up what we made earlier.

637
00:53:05,019 --> 00:53:07,989
This is Do Min Seok's movements
on May 11th.

638
00:53:08,889 --> 00:53:10,630
Do Min Seok and Do Hyun Su...

639
00:53:11,059 --> 00:53:13,260
did not come in contact
with Jung Mi Sook that day.

640
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:15,860
What were the two of them doing
in Seoul that day?

641
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:19,099
According to Do Hyun Su's
handwritten affidavit,

642
00:53:19,699 --> 00:53:21,800
the two of them often went
to see exhibitions.

643
00:53:22,139 --> 00:53:23,239
Can we believe that?

644
00:53:24,809 --> 00:53:27,710
It's detailed enough to be an alibi.

645
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:30,250
You should read some.

646
00:53:31,449 --> 00:53:34,150
Gosh, it's so long.

647
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,090
Do Min Seok lent his car,

648
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:39,250
and his accomplice
did the contacting.

649
00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:42,559
These are records of statements
made by testifiers...

650
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:45,289
who called or met with Jung Mi Sook
in those three days.

651
00:53:46,829 --> 00:53:48,300
There were a total of 57 people.

652
00:53:48,699 --> 00:53:51,400
Most of them were calls made by Jung
as she was looking for a job.

653
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:55,139
I believe we'll be able to find
the accomplice among these people.

654
00:53:57,340 --> 00:54:00,780
No. We will.

655
00:54:01,579 --> 00:54:04,250
You seem highly enthusiastic.

656
00:54:04,409 --> 00:54:06,380
You didn't want to do this case
just a few days ago.

657
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:09,780
I really want to solve...

00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:12,119
this case.

That's the only way...

660
00:54:14,989 --> 00:54:17,329
I can prepare for the next step.

661
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:21,260
Father and his accomplice...

662
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:24,329
knew Jung Mi Sook
ran away from home.

663
00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:27,869
Right? He didn't abduct Jung
on an impulse.

664
00:54:29,039 --> 00:54:31,639
She was at a bus station
to go to the hospital.

665
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:34,409
How did they abduct her?

666
00:54:37,510 --> 00:54:38,710
If it was Father...

667
00:54:44,050 --> 00:54:45,190
Do you want it?

668
00:54:55,130 --> 00:54:56,300
It's yours now.

669
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,340
Do whatever you want with it.

670
00:55:01,639 --> 00:55:04,610
You can use your hands or
some tools. Do whatever you want.

671
00:55:08,539 --> 00:55:09,909
I'll...

672
00:55:10,949 --> 00:55:12,780
only keep watching.

673
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:17,150
I bet he set a trap.

674
00:55:19,849 --> 00:55:21,590
He unusually liked traps.

675
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:26,389
I bet Jung Mi Sook went into
that trap on her own.

676
00:55:26,530 --> 00:55:27,730
What?

677
00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:31,269
Do you mean she went there
to get abducted?

- Am I wrong?

- where they were calling from.

749
01:01:36,630 --> 01:01:38,670
have you heard of the Gagyeong-ri
Village Foreman Murder Case?

750
01:01:39,469 --> 01:01:42,199
- I'm sure I've been there before.
- Do you know why he died?

751
01:01:44,139 --> 01:01:45,639
Because he meddled...

752
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:51,849
- What was that?
- Mu Jin.

753
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:55,579
Ever since we were young,
I was the one you always dissuaded.

754
01:01:56,449 --> 01:01:59,019
It's normal to feel all sorts
of emotions like me.

755
01:01:59,289 --> 01:02:00,590
He's the abnormal one.

756
01:02:03,190 --> 01:02:04,829
What do you take me for?

757
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:09,300
Do you take me as a pushover?

758
01:02:10,130 --> 01:02:12,429
You don't know how to feel
grateful or sorry.

759
01:02:12,429 --> 01:02:13,940
You're shameless and self-centered.

760
01:02:14,699 --> 01:02:16,840
No one will stay by your side.

761
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:20,440
You still don't feel anything,
do you?

762
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:25,409
But you know what?
Most people can't stand...

763
01:02:26,110 --> 01:02:27,719
the likes of you.

764
01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:33,349
How about you show your true face...

765
01:02:34,190 --> 01:02:35,420
to Detective Cha?

766
01:02:36,059 --> 01:02:39,489
He's just focused on one thing
right now.

767
01:02:39,659 --> 01:02:41,630
Do you still speak for him?

768
01:02:42,599 --> 01:02:43,969
When will you stop?

769
01:02:51,510 --> 01:02:55,409
I guess this has become
a playground.

770
01:02:58,150 --> 01:03:00,110
You're really of no help.

771
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:09,559
Sit back down.

772
01:03:13,730 --> 01:03:16,429
Sit down and listen to me.

773
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:34,750
Hyun Su,
say what you really want to say.

774
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:38,389
That's the only way
he can truly help you.

775
01:03:40,349 --> 01:03:42,289
I already said everything.

776
01:03:42,389 --> 01:03:44,260
I'm not talking about
the things you rambled.

777
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:48,530
Find out what you're
most desperate about...

778
01:03:49,159 --> 01:03:50,460
and tell us.

779
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:56,099
I have no idea
what you're getting at.

780
01:03:57,639 --> 01:03:59,269
- You do.
- I don't.

781
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:01,739
How can I know something
that I don't?

782
01:04:02,610 --> 01:04:04,110
Because you've changed.

783
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:08,280
You have.

784
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:12,250
You had no desires back then.

785
01:04:14,289 --> 01:04:15,760
But now, you do.

786
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:30,869
(Witness Testimony)

787
01:04:36,309 --> 01:04:39,980
Gosh, I'm sick of this.
Let's just catch Do Hyun Su.

788
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:41,719
He's not the accomplice.

789
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:44,690
I'm positive. Trust me on this.

790
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:48,960
That's not what I'm saying.
Let's run this kidnapping scenario.

791
01:04:49,019 --> 01:04:51,860
The accomplice kidnapped the victim
in Do Min Seok's car.

792
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:54,960
They locked her up in the trunk
and left the car there.

793
01:04:55,460 --> 01:04:57,630
Then Do Min Seok drove the car...

794
01:04:57,630 --> 01:05:00,300
and took the victim
into the basement of his workshop.

795
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:01,940
- Aren't I right?
- Yes.

796
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,139
- So?
- That means...

797
01:05:04,139 --> 01:05:06,969
they would've met at least twice
while handing over the car key.

798
01:05:07,210 --> 01:05:09,110
Then Do Hyun Su must've seen
the accomplice.

799
01:05:10,510 --> 01:05:14,380
They could've left the key
inside the car.

800
01:05:14,679 --> 01:05:17,550
That's what a normal person would do
for their convenience.

801
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:21,590
If they left the key inside,
that means the doors were unlocked.

802
01:05:22,519 --> 01:05:24,889
Why would they leave the keys
in an unlocked car...

803
01:05:25,559 --> 01:05:26,730
when the victim is inside?

804
01:05:27,230 --> 01:05:28,300
That's absurd.

805
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:33,769
Maybe they left it
in a specific area.

806
01:05:33,769 --> 01:05:35,170
The car key was a tool used
during their crime.

807
01:05:35,170 --> 01:05:37,840
If it were me, I would've handed it
over face to face.

808
01:05:38,010 --> 01:05:40,780
If not, it'd only increase
the variables...

809
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:42,480
and make it harder
to control the situation.

810
01:05:44,050 --> 01:05:47,110
But how will we find Do Hyun Su?

811
01:05:48,050 --> 01:05:49,420
Even the cold case team
can't locate him.

812
01:05:50,789 --> 01:05:52,420
That's exactly why...

813
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:55,289
I'm reading this.

814
01:05:59,329 --> 01:06:00,900
I need to head out for a bit.

815
01:06:01,559 --> 01:06:03,159
What? Where to?

816
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,030
The bank.

817
01:06:10,969 --> 01:06:14,710
Didn't she just think
of where to go?

818
01:06:16,780 --> 01:06:20,550
He could've met the accomplice
without knowing.

819
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:22,619
I need to let him know that.

820
01:06:41,699 --> 01:06:42,699
Are you a kid or what?

821
01:06:59,090 --> 01:07:00,190
Here.

822
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:04,960
You too. Open up.

823
01:07:22,610 --> 01:07:24,480
I want to live as Baek Hee Seong.

824
01:07:27,949 --> 01:07:30,050
There's nothing I want to become...

825
01:07:30,650 --> 01:07:32,019
or do.

826
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:36,389
I just want to live as him.
That's it.

827
01:07:40,059 --> 01:07:42,130
I don't want to lose
the life I have.

828
01:07:43,199 --> 01:07:44,300
Ever.

829
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:55,809
That's all that I want.

830
01:07:58,110 --> 01:08:00,579
I had no intention
of wanting to upset you.

831
01:08:05,349 --> 01:08:07,559
I thought I knew
pretty much everything...

832
01:08:08,590 --> 01:08:10,420
about people's responses
to emotions.

833
01:08:12,929 --> 01:08:17,060
But at times, I don't know why
people get upset.

834
01:08:21,569 --> 01:08:25,869
Do you want me to say
that I'm thankful and sorry...

835
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:28,279
right now?

836
01:08:30,310 --> 01:08:31,750
I can say that
as often as you want me to...

837
01:08:33,779 --> 01:08:35,319
as long as you continue
to help me.

838
01:08:39,289 --> 01:08:40,619
Forget it.

839
01:08:40,619 --> 01:08:42,460
What's the point
in forcing you to do it?

840
01:08:46,189 --> 01:08:49,359
But this isn't working.

841
01:08:50,260 --> 01:08:52,300
Even if you listen to it
a thousand times, you won't know.

842
01:08:54,029 --> 01:08:55,239
But this is different.

843
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:58,369
I'm pretty close with Detective Im
in the reinvestigation team.

844
01:08:59,609 --> 01:09:02,380
I'll call him out
and get drunk with him.

845
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:04,909
He might leak something then.

846
01:09:05,779 --> 01:09:07,010
Thank you, Mu Jin.

847
01:09:08,250 --> 01:09:11,119
No. It's nothing.

848
01:09:12,489 --> 01:09:15,560
What are you doing?
Hurry up and call him.

849
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:17,960
I will. I'll call him now.
I'm calling him.

850
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:19,189
Gosh.

851
01:09:20,689 --> 01:09:22,659
(Gangsu Police Station's Im Ho Joon)

852
01:09:22,659 --> 01:09:23,859
(Gangsu Police Station's Cha Ji Won)

853
01:09:23,899 --> 01:09:24,899
Darn it.

854
01:09:25,829 --> 01:09:27,369
Hey. It's Detective Cha.

855
01:09:29,939 --> 01:09:31,939
Wait. Calm down, everyone.

856
01:09:32,010 --> 01:09:33,069
Calm down. It's okay.

857
01:09:33,770 --> 01:09:35,109
Don't be startled.

858
01:09:35,539 --> 01:09:38,710
Especially you.
Don't even make a sound.

859
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:40,050
Okay?

860
01:09:42,579 --> 01:09:47,050
(Gangsu Police Station's Cha Ji Won)

861
01:09:49,319 --> 01:09:50,720
Detective Cha.

862
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:53,529
What is it?

863
01:09:54,659 --> 01:09:55,760
Are you sick?

864
01:09:58,069 --> 01:09:59,369
I have enteritis.

865
01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:03,500
Did something happen?

866
01:10:05,039 --> 01:10:07,640
I'd like to meet you.
Are you home?

867
01:10:09,609 --> 01:10:11,310
I'm really sorry,

868
01:10:13,979 --> 01:10:16,779
but I can't move an inch right now.

869
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:21,390
Take care of yourself well.
I'll see you next time.

870
01:10:21,789 --> 01:10:22,920
Okay.

871
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:39,710
Guys, the pizza's finally here.

872
01:10:42,479 --> 01:10:43,539
Coming.

873
01:10:54,659 --> 01:10:57,319
Detective Cha.

874
01:10:58,289 --> 01:10:59,460
I called your work,

875
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:02,560
and they were excited because
you're working on another exclusive.

876
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:05,369
I'm curious to know
what you're working on.

877
01:11:06,270 --> 01:11:08,000
What exclusive?

878
01:11:08,699 --> 01:11:11,939
I have enteritis,
so I'm feeling sick.

879
01:11:12,569 --> 01:11:13,840
Your pizza is here.

880
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:17,340
I see.

881
01:11:22,850 --> 01:11:25,020
Are you eating pizza
when you have enteritis?

882
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:26,819
People say you should...

883
01:11:27,149 --> 01:11:29,460
eat well when you're sick.

884
01:11:31,989 --> 01:11:33,090
Is someone inside?

885
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:45,609
You went through so much...

886
01:11:47,539 --> 01:11:49,439
keeping alive until now.

887
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:54,779
You did enough.

888
01:11:58,850 --> 01:11:59,850
I won't...

889
01:12:01,319 --> 01:12:02,960
make you feel lonely.

890
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:07,260
Wait for me there.

891
01:12:11,069 --> 01:12:12,170
I'll...

892
01:12:13,670 --> 01:12:14,770
see you soon.

893
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:10,289
Honey.

894
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:12,560
Honey!

895
01:13:14,699 --> 01:13:16,329
- Hee Seong!
- Leave him!

896
01:13:16,529 --> 01:13:18,569
- Are you crazy?
- This is the right thing to do.

897
01:13:18,569 --> 01:13:19,630
It's the right thing to do!

898
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:23,500
How can you live after doing this?

899
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:26,010
I won't live.
You can live by yourself.

900
01:13:26,170 --> 01:13:28,710
You can get respect as the director
of a university hospital,

901
01:13:28,710 --> 01:13:32,149
and live in all kinds of luxury.
You do that.

902
01:13:34,109 --> 01:13:35,279
Is it an informant?

903
01:13:37,050 --> 01:13:39,119
What kind of informant
would come to my house?

904
01:13:40,220 --> 01:13:42,220
Detective Cha.

905
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:45,829
Should we meet at the cafe
down there in about an hour?

906
01:13:47,029 --> 01:13:49,000
I'll wait here until you're done.

907
01:13:49,659 --> 01:13:51,569
Or you can share
the information with me.

908
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:54,470
What information?
I don't know anything.

909
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:56,699
Reporter Kim, did something happen?

910
01:14:00,539 --> 01:14:03,439
- Please, just stop it!
- Let go!

911
01:14:05,079 --> 01:14:06,210
No!

912
01:15:24,460 --> 01:15:28,899
(Flower of Evil)

913
01:15:29,159 --> 01:15:31,329
I think I'll be able to find
where the accomplice made his calls.

914
01:15:31,699 --> 01:15:34,069
I've figured out what that sound is.

915
01:15:34,170 --> 01:15:36,699
You don't have to worry about
the accident from that day.

916
01:15:36,699 --> 01:15:38,109
We already resolved it.

917
01:15:38,409 --> 01:15:41,279
You can't even report it
to the police. Spit it out.

918
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:43,909
"A trap"? You want to set a trap?

919
01:15:44,010 --> 01:15:46,579
Let's see who threw the bait
at Jung Mi Sook.

920
01:15:47,109 --> 01:15:48,619
We should throw a bait too.

921
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:51,590
Ms. Do Hae Su, is there something
you want to tell me?

922
01:15:52,220 --> 01:15:53,250
Actually...

923
01:15:54,020 --> 01:15:55,289
I only need you to trust me.

924
01:15:55,289 --> 01:15:57,819
Just keep your eyes on me
as you do now.
