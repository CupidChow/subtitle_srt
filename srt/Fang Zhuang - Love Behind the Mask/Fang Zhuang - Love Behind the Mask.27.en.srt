00:00:39,712 --> 00:00:41,280
=Episode 27=

3
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,399
Young Master,

4
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:47,880
there's no trace of Wen Fuyu.

5
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:49,759
It's as if she just disappeared.

6
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,159
However,

7
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,439
when searching the palace,

8
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,280
we discovered a prince.

9
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,679
His mother was a palace maid.

10
00:00:57,439 --> 00:00:59,159
She was favored
by the emperor by chance.

11
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:01,560
Later, Wen Fuyu and the empress hid her

12
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,000
and her son in Yeting.

13
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:04,760
Even the emperor, Wen Jiulin,

14
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,079
didn't know about the boy.

15
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:15,920
What is your name?

16
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:18,480
My name is Wen Xuan.

17
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:20,319
Should we kill him here?

18
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,239
If we spare his life,

19
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:24,079
he might seek revenge

20
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:25,439
for Wen Jiulin.

21
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,000
Let all the hatred

22
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:37,040
stop here at this moment.

23
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:39,879
From now on,

24
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,200
we just need to clear

25
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,079
my parents' names.

26
00:01:47,392 --> 00:01:48,239
(Taiji Hall)

27
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:49,719
Under the mandate of heaven,

28
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,280
as His Majesty decreed,

29
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,799
by the nation's will,

30
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,359
Crown Prince Wen Xuan

31
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:55,719
is diligent and hardworking

32
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,640
and hereby inherits the throne

33
00:01:57,879 --> 00:01:59,159
by the late emperor's will.

34
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:01,079
He shall pray to heaven and ancestors

35
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,319
to succeed the throne.

36
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:04,400
May Linzhao prosper forever.

37
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,599
The former Lord of Zishang, Si Xun,

38
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,719
and his wife

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,080
were murdered by the traitor Si Sheng

40
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,520
and died with grievances.

41
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:13,240
After proving their innocence,

42
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:15,919
they are titled as Yongyi
and buried in the state cemetery.

43
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:18,520
Si Yichen has defeated the enemy

44
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,120
and protected the new emperor.

45
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:22,639
He shall extend the lineage
of the Si family

46
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,479
and govern Zishang State

47
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,199
and hence is conferred
the title of Lord of Zishang.

48
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,800
This is decreed.

49
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,280
Long live Your Majesty.

50
00:02:38,432 --> 00:02:39,040
(Princess Royal's Mansion)

51
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,240
(Three years later)

52
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:40,919
My lord,

53
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:42,840
since you
repelled the Xuanhuang invaders

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,520
and helped Wen Xuan to the throne,

55
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:45,840
the lives

56
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,000
of the people

57
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:48,240
have gotten better.

58
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:49,879
The new emperor is young.

59
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,719
We can't relax completely yet.

60
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,039
Our most pressing task

61
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:57,759
is to re-establish

62
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:59,439
diplomatic relations with Zhuyan

63
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:01,199
and be wary of Xuanhuang.

64
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,039
Once everything has settled down,

65
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:05,639
I can return to Zishang
with peace of mind.

66
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:06,880
My lord,

67
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,560
grateful for your hard work,

68
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,039
the new emperor granted you
a new residence.

69
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,000
How about...

70
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:13,800
No need.

71
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,759
I will stay here.

72
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,319
I am used to this place.

73
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:19,360
My lord,

74
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,360
it has been three years.

75
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,680
Leave it to me.

76
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,599
Give it to me.

77
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,759
Your Highness.

78
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,160
Shi'an, you are here.

79
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:34,639
Official duties are overwhelming.

80
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,720
I came to take a break.

81
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,439
No, you came here to slack off.

82
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:41,639
Did you hand over
all the work to Jiyao again?

83
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,600
She hasn't

84
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,120
slept well for several days.

85
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:45,439
If I don't visit you often,

86
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,720
I'm afraid

87
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,240
you'll sneak out again.

88
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,439
"You can't leave here."

89
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:51,360
"You can't see anyone."

90
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,600
I've heard these words

91
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,040
plenty of times.

92
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,079
Foreign envoys have been visiting.

93
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,120
I just want you to be safe.

94
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,279
Be good.

95
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,879
After this period is over,

96
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,680
I'll take you
to see Zhuyan's beautiful landscapes.

97
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,480
But you said this

98
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,279
last year, the year before last,

99
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:08,879
and the year before that.

100
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:12,079
Who knows when it will come true?

101
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:23,399
Don't be so close to the desk.

102
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:24,720
Mind your eyes.

103
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,600
Since when did you care about me?

104
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,040
If you are sick,

105
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,240
I will have no great scholar
to assist me.

106
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,439
Fine.

107
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:38,120
If you do not increase my salary soon,

108
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:39,560
I might really get sick.

109
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,920
Do you want more salary?

110
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,560
How is the work going?

111
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:47,600
The meals and accommodation

112
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:48,839
arrangements for the envoys

113
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
have all been settled.

114
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,680
There is one more thing.

115
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,920
News from the post

116
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,399
says the Lord of Zishang
will come with the envoys

117
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,879
and be here tonight.

118
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,319
Wrong letter.

119
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,279
What you took

120
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,879
is the love poem my deputy sent me.

121
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,560
Your love poems

122
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:11,800
are more than the memorials to me.

123
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,279
It's getting colder.

124
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,040
They can kindle the fire.

125
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,040
Hearing he's coming,

126
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,480
you seem a bit uneasy.

127
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:27,240
Why should I be uneasy?

128
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:29,040
I have a clear conscience.

129
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:31,040
How about you?

130
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,839
Among so many young noblemen,

131
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:34,680
don't you fancy any one?

132
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,920
I'm not like you.

133
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,920
My conscience is guilty.

134
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,600
It's the Lantern Festival.

135
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,319
Walk with her if you're free.

136
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,319
Staying in this deep palace all day

137
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,879
will imprison one's heart too.

My lord,

141
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:55,279
we've arrived in Zhuyan.

142
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,879
My lord,

143
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:05,879
the journey is long

144
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:07,040
and tiring.

145
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,759
Let's go back and rest.

146
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:12,959
Not yet.

147
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,839
Enjoy the scenery with me.

148
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:30,040
Bai Ling, wait for me here.

149
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,720
I will be right back.

what's wrong?

175
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,960
I've found her.

176
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:34,039
I've finally found her.

177
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:47,879

178
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:52,600
I...

179
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,759
just walked around.

180
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:59,600
Why didn't you inform me?

181
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:01,039
Sorry.

182
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:02,000
I forgot.

183
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,840
You wouldn't even listen to me.

184
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,799
Didn't I tell you not to go out?

185
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,080
Why?

186
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:10,679
Why exactly is all that?

Sorry, Wangyou.

192
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:22,679
You were hurt by bad people
and lost your memory.

193
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:25,240
I don't want to lose you again.

194
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,480
I am really scared.

195
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,240
But

196
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,639
why don't I

197
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,879
have any impression of these at all?

198
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,919
Am I really a princess
who grew up in Zhuyan?

199
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:41,360
Are we really engaged?

200
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,559
Did I really

201
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:44,159
love you to the bone in the past?

202
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,399
Why can't I remember anything?

203
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,639
Wangyou, look at me.

204
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,679
The past is the past.

205
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:51,720
When we get married,

206
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,519
I will spend my life making you
fall in love with me.

207
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,960
It's late.

208
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:02,080
Rest soon.

209
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:20,200
Your Highness.

210
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,240
Don't come to Wangyou's place again.

211
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,559
Your face is not suitable.

212
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,720
(Why?)

213
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:39,808
My lord,

214
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,559
the map is ready.

215
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:44,039
Thank you.

216
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:56,200
Long time no see,

217
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,600
Si Yichen.

218
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,200
Your Highness,

219
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,440
long time no see.

220
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:04,559
Lord of Zishang,

221
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:06,279
I heard you are not married yet.

222
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,080
There are countless noble ladies
in Zhuyan.

223
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:10,080
If we could reach

224
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,080
a marriage contract,

225
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,399
wouldn't that be wonderful?

226
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:14,000
Thank you.

227
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,000
But I prefer not.

228
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:17,200
I've come

229
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:18,440
to discuss

230
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:19,720
an important matter

231
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,960
with you.

232
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,688
I'm all ears.

233
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,919
In the past years,

234
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:26,240
Linzhao and Zhuyan's relationship
has been declining.

235
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,399
Our delegation comes

236
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:30,039
to re-establish

237
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,720
friendship with Zhuyan

238
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,399
to fight against Xuanhuang together.

239
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:35,440
Lord of Zishang,

240
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:38,000
take a look
at the current situation, alright?

241
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:39,559
Xuanhuang targets

242
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:41,159
only Linzhao.

243
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,440
They have great respect for Zhuyan.

244
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,080
Why should I bring trouble to myself?

245
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,279
Xuanhuang's army

246
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:50,440
has been entrenched

247
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,279
at the border between Linzhao and Zhuyan

248
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:54,440
and kept harassing Linzhao

249
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:55,600
and inciting war.

250
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,399
On the surface,
they want to capture Linzhao.

251
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,639
In fact,

252
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,960
they are also coveting Zhuyan.

253
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:03,960
I think

254
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,000
Xuanhuang's army does all the dealings

255
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,000
about their supplies

256
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,039
with Zhuyan, right?

257
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,960
I'm afraid you are wrong.

258
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,879
With Xuanhuang's people coming

259
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,840
to Zhuyan,

260
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,360
Zhuyan's people can do more business,

261
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:16,919
and our economy can boost.

262
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:17,759
Don't you

263
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,279
think it's great for us?

264
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,320
It's Xuanhuang's long-term strategy.

265
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:24,799
They first invest in trade

266
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,600
to gain your people's favor.

267
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:28,600
Then there'll be cultural integration

268
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,559
through marriages

269
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:31,240
and subversion.

270
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,480
The border of Zhuyan is vast

271
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,879
without enough troops.

272
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:36,600
Once there is a gap,

273
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:39,279
Xuanhuang can
immediately invade your capital.

274
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,399
I think

275
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:43,639
you would also not want to see

276
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,679
your people turning against each other.

277
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:48,639
I'll wait

278
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,600
for your response.

279
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,159
I'm leaving now.

280
00:13:59,488 --> 00:14:00,992
(Palace Map)

281
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,759
What Si Yichen said makes sense.

282
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,240
Not long ago, when I went to the border,

283
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,200
I found that most of our people

284
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,080
were dressed like the Xuanhuang people.

285
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:12,039
I'm afraid

286
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:13,480
what he said is not baseless.

287
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,159
Let's enhance border control first

288
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,039
and limit Xuanhuang people's access.

289
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:18,320
Remember

290
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:20,559
to keep it from the Xuanhuang people.

291
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:23,000
About the alliance with Linzhao?

292
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:24,559
It needs to be reconsidered.

293
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,600
Si Yichen is prone to suspicion.

294
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,639
Now with Xuanhuang restraining him,

295
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:30,240
Linzhao

296
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,000
cannot hold the dominant position.

297
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,696
