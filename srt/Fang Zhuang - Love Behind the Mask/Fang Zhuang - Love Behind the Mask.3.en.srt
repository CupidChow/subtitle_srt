00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,119
(Could it be...)

5
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:48,759
Shu.

6
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:53,920
It's you.

7
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:56,640
Thank you for the medicine.

8
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:57,560
It's effective.

9
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,600
Did you come here

10
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:00,159
just to say thank you?

11
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,319
Easy.

12
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,040
Put it down.

13
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,079
Thank you,

14
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:13,888
my lady.

15
00:01:14,484 --> 00:01:16,192
(Lady?)

16
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:24,319
You're welcome.

17
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:25,200
Shu,

18
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:28,400
why did you do that to him?

19
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,400
That's what you did only to me!

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,680
I used to like red,

21
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,040
but now I don't.

22
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,519
I used to do this to you,

23
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:39,519
now I can do it to others too.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,359
People change.

25
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:43,200
Don't you think so?

26
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:44,840
Brother.

27
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:55,120
My lady.

28
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:56,359
It's late.

29
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:57,799
You should rest.

30
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,599
You may leave.

31
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:08,919
(Myriad Threads reacted just now.)

32
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,120
(What has triggered his hatred?)

33
00:02:14,323 --> 00:02:15,232
(Prosperity Court)

34
00:02:16,864 --> 00:02:19,360
(All those bodies lying around at
Lord of Zishang's Mansion.)

35
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,879
(And your fascination with blood)

36
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,599
(was)

37
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,879
(truly captivating.)

38
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,360
(Why is the flower of hatred
blooming now?)

39
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:04,800
(Anyway,)

40
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,960
(it's a good start.)

41
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:16,719
(Next, I should collect)

42
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,400
(the flower of love.)

43
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,159
(Father,)

44
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:23,319
(once I have the Flower of Three Lives,)

45
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:25,520
(I will avenge you all.)

46
00:03:30,067 --> 00:03:31,328
(Lord of the World)

47
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:35,000
Your Majesty, he has arrived.

48
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,199
Let him in.

49
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:37,800
Yes.

50
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,639
Let him in!

51
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:43,560
Greetings,

52
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:44,639
Your Majesty.

53
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:45,400
From now on,

54
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,039
(Zi Mo, Wen Yanshu's bodyguard)
you'll protect the Princess Royal.

55
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:49,039
If she becomes pregnant,

56
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,039
report to me immediately.

57
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,240
Understood.

58
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:57,360
(Lord)
My imperial throne

59
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,879
is built upon the blood of my own kin.

60
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:03,400
Tell me,

61
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,599
will the gods

62
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,759
punish me?

63
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:08,840
You are destined by heaven,

64
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:10,520
sharing eternity with the gods.

65
00:04:13,715 --> 00:04:15,968
(Lord of the World, Prosperous Forever)

66
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,279
Tell me,

67
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,000
why are you

68
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,160
devoted to me?

69
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:36,160
When you spent a lot on me

70
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:38,439
at the Courtesan House,

71
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:41,199
I fell in love with you.

72
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,560
When you bought all the latest clothes
for me from the Imperial Wardrobe,

73
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,519
I vowed

74
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,680
to follow you forever.

75
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:49,879
It's you

76
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,480
who gave me the study supplies

77
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:53,319
and allowed me to study

78
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:54,519
in your manor.

79
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:56,240
In this world,

80
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,879
apart from you,

81
00:04:58,279 --> 00:04:59,199
I love no one else.

82
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,120
Your beauty is unparalleled.

83
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:04,240
I've got in love the moment I saw you.

84
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,560
However,

85
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:08,360
we live in your manor

86
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,160
but have never got your favor.

87
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,079
Yet, you allow that plain-looking Mu Han

88
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,959
to serve you.

89
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,079
Princess Royal.

90
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,600
I...

91
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,279
Get out.

92
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,839
The questioning is over.

93
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:26,519
You can leave now.

94
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:34,560
Mu Han.

95
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:38,439
(I will make you fall in love with me.)

96
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:45,360
These are all for you.

97
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,120
From now on,

98
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:48,079
you will live in this room.

99
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,040
Why give me these things?

100
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,160
Because I am in a good mood.

101
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,360
Any objections?

102
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,480
Just as the rumors say,

103
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,560
you live a luxurious life.

104
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:57,720
Do you like

105
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:59,360
these treasures?

106
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,360
Then, what about

107
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,959
the four arts

108
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,519
or antiques?

109
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,120
I do not like them.

110
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,959
Don't waste effort on me.

111
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:14,240
(How could one from an ordinary family)

112
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:16,560
(be uninterested with these treasures?)

113
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:17,800
(Or perhaps...)

114
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,319
Come to my chamber later.

115
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,959
Why did you

116
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:01,959
summon me here?

117
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,439
Come here.

118
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,920
At this moment,

119
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,319
what are you thinking about?

120
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:26,240
What do you think?

121
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:32,720
My lady.

122
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,079
Give me your hands.

123
00:07:45,472 --> 00:07:47,872
So this is what you're into.

124
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,759
But

125
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,199
I don't want to do that.

126
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,480
You have so many toyboys.

127
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:04,480
The best

128
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,560
should be saved for last.

129
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:09,560
You...

130
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,120
Brother.

131
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:25,759
(Perfect timing, huh?)

132
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:26,879
Shu,

133
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,199
come with me.

134
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,000
My lady.

135
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,039
Where are you going?

136
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:46,960
Shu.

137
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,120
I know you like
the pastries of Zhuyan State.

138
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,120
I heard that the chef of this restaurant

139
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:52,440
is from Zhuyan State.

140
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:54,799
So I bought the entire restaurant

141
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,879
for you.

142
00:08:57,799 --> 00:08:58,440
Brother.

143
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,679
Today, I'm here

144
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,399
to tell you,

145
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,399
from now on,

146
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,519
you don't need

147
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:05,679
to go to such lengths for me.

148
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,279
Shu,

149
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,559
when you dragged me

150
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:12,440
into the endless abyss that night,

151
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:15,120
you never minded our relations.

152
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,759
You and I...

153
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,080
The past is the past!

154
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:19,399
The future is different.

155
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:22,320
Shu,

156
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,720
why did you become like this?

157
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,080
Have you fallen for Mu Han?

158
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,080
None of your business.

159
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:29,159
Shu,

160
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:31,519
I'm sorry.

161
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,159
I shouldn't shout at you.

162
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,240
No matter where your heart is,

163
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:38,519
I will bring it back to me.

164
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,679
Alright?

165
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:41,840
This ill-fated love

166
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,799
should end here.

167
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,480
Even ill-fated, it's still love.

168
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,000
It'll never be over

169
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,320
between us.

That witch

172
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:13,840
dared steal the ghost husband.

173
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:15,200
I'll deal with her.
