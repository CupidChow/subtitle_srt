00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,960
Capture the rebel attempting
to sabotage the marriage alliance.

4
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:45,200
Yes!

5
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:02,520
I didn't expect

6
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,760
you would have this day.

7
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:08,920
I knew you would plot against me.

8
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,680
I was just betting

9
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:13,680
whether your feelings

10
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,079
for Shu were genuine or not.

11
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,519
I was betting

12
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,920
whether you would show her any mercy.

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,680
But unexpectedly,

14
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,760
you had not a shred of mercy.

15
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,840
My mercy

16
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,280
is not killing her myself.

17
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,439
When she reaches Yan Shi'an's place,

18
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,680
she will die in pieces.

19
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:38,319
What did you say?

20
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:40,400
Yan Shi'an has no grudge against her.

21
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,719
Why would he do that?

22
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:47,920
You want to know?

23
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:50,680
Then ask him yourself.

24
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:53,640
But I fear

25
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:56,560
that now you won't be able

26
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,680
to leave this place.

27
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:00,120
Mu Han,

28
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,959
who are you exactly?

29
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:05,120
Who are you?

30
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,799
When I return from escorting the bride,

31
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,840
I will take your life.

32
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:12,840
He Chuan,

33
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,080
be prepared.

34
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:16,879
Mu Han!

35
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,120
Mu Han! Mu Han!

36
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,680
What's with your dress?

37
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,719
I don't like the wedding dress.

38
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:38,280
Rest here.

39
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:39,240
I want some tea.

40
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,240
If we don't reach the post

41
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:42,439
before dark,

42
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm afraid

43
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:45,879
we'll have to camp in the wild.

44
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,400
I'd love to.

45
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:49,439
Rest here.

46
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,599
Yes.

47
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:05,319
The water for tea must be spring water.

48
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,599
Make it again.

49
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:08,400
When will you stop the fuss?

50
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,360
If we delay the marriage time,

51
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,759
I will have no way
to explain it to both countries.

52
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:17,000
You're so eager to send me
for a marriage alliance.

53
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:18,280
Do you fear

54
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:20,360
I'll spoil your wedding with Wen Fuyu?

55
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:21,919
You...!

56
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,680
You used to be my dog.

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,599
Now you've

58
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:27,960
become His Majesty's dog.

59
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:29,840
Zi Mo,

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,879
protect Her Highness.

61
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,240
I'll go fetch spring water now

62
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,719
to make tea for Her Highness.

63
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,120
(Is it too much for me)

64
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,680
(to treat him like this?)

65
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,680
If I hadn't

66
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,439
made you a guard,

67
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,840
perhaps now,

68
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,520
you'd still be a toyboy in my mansion,

69
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:58,639
and I wouldn't

70
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,879
have to marry Yan Shi'an.

71
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,759
It's late.

72
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,400
Get some rest, Your Highness.

73
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,560
Before reaching Zhuyan State,

74
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,839
allow me to perform one last dance.

Miss, see if there is anything you like.

147
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,320
This is all our ancestral jade.

148
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,440
It can ensure safety.

149
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:52,759
This is Peace Jade.

150
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:53,840
The jade...

151
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:55,240
It's called Peace Jade.

152
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,399
Peace Jade?

153
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:58,039
It can ensure safety?

154
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,080
Of course.

155
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,360
The wearer lives

156
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,679
if the jade remains.

157
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:03,240
And the jade breaks

158
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,799
when the wearer dies.

159
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,639

160
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:07,919

161
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,360
May I exchange my jade pendant

162
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,480
for your Peace Jade?

163
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:20,799

166
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,279
the Peace Jade will also work.

167
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,600
This Peace Jade

168
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,200
is for you.

169
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:54,720
