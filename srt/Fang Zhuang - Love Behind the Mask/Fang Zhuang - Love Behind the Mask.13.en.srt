=Love Behind the Mask=

2
00:00:39,712 --> 00:00:41,248
=Episode 13=

3
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:53,399
Are you okay?

4
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,799
Let me help you back.

5
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,519
Yan Shi'an

6
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:15,439
seems to have hostility towards you.

7
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,519
I'm afraid he's just taking

8
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:20,599
the opportunity to punish me.

9
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,239
In the past, if someone
disrespected you,

10
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,040
you would always seek revenge.

11
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,640
But this time,

12
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,719
you're

13
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:32,920
defending him?

14
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,239
It seems your gaze towards him

15
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:37,840
is somewhat different.

16
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,224
Is that so?

17
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,519
When you look at Wen Fuyu,

18
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,040
your gaze also seems different.

19
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:52,519
Your Highness, rest early.

20
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,719
Shi'an,

21
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:05,000
Yichen contracted a madness.

22
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,480
I will take him for secluded treatment.

23
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:08,719
I leave her

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,560
in your care.

25
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,479
It's been ten years.

26
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:15,904
Here,

27
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,319
it has always been just us.

28
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,280
Anning,

29
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,599
don't worry.

30
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,159
He will come back.

31
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,840
He probably

32
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,919
won't recognize me, right?

33
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,039
But

34
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,199
he will recognize you.

35
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,039
Shi'an.

36
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:43,039
Mother.

37
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,439
All these years,

38
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,439
your father and I have been
searching for you.

39
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:50,039
Come home with me.

40
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,120
Don't go.

41
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:55,639
Anning,

42
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,319
rest assured.

43
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,280
I will return soon.

44
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,848
(Yaoguang Town)

45
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:27,800
Yan Shi'an.

46
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,360
Does it hurt?

47
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,080
It hurts.

48
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,120
This is just a meeting gift.

49
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:53,039
See you at the palace tomorrow.

50
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,584
(Suoqing Palace)

51
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:14,840
Your Highness.

52
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,000
I don't understand.

53
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:26,399
Go ahead.

54
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,240
I have never met you before.

55
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:32,519
Why do you have
such a strong hostility towards me?

56
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,079
Your Highness,

57
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,920
I heard she met with

58
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,000
a tragic fate assassinating

59
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:40,120
the princess.

60
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,240
What did you say?

61
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:44,879
Anning.

62
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,560
Wen Yanshu.

63
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,680
It's you.

64
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,759
You killed Anning.

65
00:04:59,199 --> 00:04:59,712
I...

66
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,639
No.

67
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,199
(I can't tell him the truth)

68
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,639
(and involve him in the revenge.)

69
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,759
Even if I killed her,

70
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:12,879
so what?

71
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,439
I want you dead.

72
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:21,079
This is called Devouring Heart Poison.

73
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:23,199
A hundred poisons

74
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,199
devour your heart.

75
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,279
But don't worry,

76
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:30,120
I won't let you die so soon.

77
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,360
You only need to endure for two hours.

78
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,879
For her,

79
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,600
you imprisoned the princess of a nation.

80
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:50,240
If you reveal this,

81
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,360
I will withdraw all military pay.

82
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,079
I know you don't care about
those people.

83
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,079
But once you are defeated,

84
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,279
your glory and wealth will disappear.

85
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,560
Enjoy yourself.

86
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,040
Yanshu is not here.

87
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,959
I just saw her

88
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,560
go to the Crown Prince's room.

89
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,879
It seems

90
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:33,240
she is quite familiar

91
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,319
with the Crown Prince.

92
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,639
It seems

93
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:36,959
they intend to chat all night.

94
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,160
I advise you

95
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:43,480
not to go.

96
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:44,920
After all,

97
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,199
new love and old flame

98
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:48,040
are common sights in her eyes.

99
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,040
You really are a good servant
of Wen Yanshu.

100
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:15,040
You actually found here.

101
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,439
Your methods are clumsy.

102
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,519
Truly disappointing.

103
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,000
What do you mean by this?

104
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:25,839
Why do you request for
a marriage alliance with Linzhao?

105
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,839
By then, Her Highness
will become your wife.

106
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:31,240
By that time,

107
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,120
you can do

108
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,800
whatever you want.

109
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:37,560
You seem

110
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,279
to be different from the rumors.

111
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,240
Upon seeing you today,

112
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:42,920
it is truly surprising.

113
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:54,800
It's just a rumor.

114
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:55,839
Don't take it seriously.

115
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,240
The point is

116
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,639
to achieve our goals.

117
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,000
Isn't it?

118
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,959
You are awake.

119
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:31,759
Today's matter

120
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:33,720
must not be disclosed.

121
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,039
Especially not to He Chuan.

122
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,320
Rest assured.

123
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,840
I know what I'm doing.

124
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,559
Kidnap the Linzhao princess?

125
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,080
Do you want to provoke
a war between the two countries?

126
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,519
You are the future king of Xuanhuang.

127
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,039
Are you really willing

128
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,360
to let Xuanhuang
be oppressed by Linzhao?

129
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,720
As long as you hold her hostage,

130
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,320
you can demand

131
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,039
territories from Linzhao.

132
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,960
So,

133
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:15,799
you have a plan now?

134
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:19,679
This is the route

135
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,360
for Wen Yanshu to return.

136
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:24,960
The rest

137
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:26,639
is up to you.

138
00:09:36,384 --> 00:09:37,408
(Left Gate)

139
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,000
Her Highness overexerted herself

140
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,399
and is resting now.

141
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,440
Best not to disturb her.

142
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,360
Step aside.

143
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:46,840
Don't worry,

144
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:48,759
I am just tired.

145
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,320
I can go on with the trip.

146
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,600
You and Mu Han go ahead first.

147
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:54,440
Father is waiting for you.

148
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:55,960
Don't delay important matters.

149
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:00,512
My lord,

150
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:02,039
if you are worried,

151
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,639
I can go with her

152
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:04,919
and take care of her.

153
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:06,200
What about Princess Jiyao?

154
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,919
She said

155
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:09,399
she wanted to stay

156
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:10,399
for a few more days.

157
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:12,039
You should set off now

158
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,200
and travel day and night.

159
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,320
Maybe you can arrive at Linzhao early

160
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:17,080
to avoid delaying

161
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,159
the serious matters.

162
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:47,440
Mu Han said

163
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,240
he loves me.

164
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,960
When we return to Linzhao,

165
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,399
he will ask Father and Mother

166
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,159
to grant us a marriage.

167
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:56,559
What did you say?

168
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:57,799
Marriage?

169
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:04,960
The enemies are here.

170
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,120
Run away now!

171
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:28,608
Bai Ze,

172
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:30,360
deliver this letter

173
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:32,000
to His Majesty quikly.

174
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:32,864
Yes.

175
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,039
What did you say?

176
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,960
Shu and Fuyu

177
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:45,159
were kidnapped?

178
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:46,279
Your Majesty,

179
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,200
they demand you give

180
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:49,559
three cities

181
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:50,720
within three days.

182
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,392
Otherwise...

183
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:52,720
Three cities?

184
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,879
How dare you!

185
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:56,128
Your Majesty,

186
00:11:57,559 --> 00:11:58,480
the big picture

187
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,840
takes priority.

188
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:01,200
Your Majesty.

189
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:02,039
Your Majesty.

190
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,279
We'd better save them first.

191
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,240
If...

192
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,360
Report!

193
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,039
Your Majesty,

194
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,360
Crown Prince of Zhuyan

195
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,759
sent an urgent letter.

196
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,159
(If the Princess Royal marries me,)

197
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,120
(I'm willing to devote
all our national power)

198
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,000
(to help you eliminate
external enemies.)

199
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,320
Where are the Shadow Guards?

200
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:22,440
Your Majesty.

201
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,480
Convey my order.

202
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:26,240
At all costs,

203
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,879
rescue the two princesses.

204
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:28,399
Yes.

205
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,039
Your Majesty,

206
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:29,879
Shadow Guards

207
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,399
might alert the enemy.

208
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,224
I

209
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,480
request to rescue them.

210
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:36,039
I will go rescue them too.

211
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:37,200
Very well.

212
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:39,440
It's rare that both of you

213
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,559
have such intentions.

214
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,840
In that case,

215
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:42,960
within three days,

216
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,960
whoever rescues them first

217
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,080
will be ennobled.

218
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,759
If they are harmed,

219
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:51,159
you two

220
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,960
atone with your lives.

221
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:54,919
Yes.

222
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:08,600
Young Master.

223
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,039
Are you going to rescue Wen Yanshu?

224
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,120
Wait until I return.

225
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,480
I forgot to tell you.

226
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:18,480
I instructed the prince of Xuanhuang

227
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:19,559
to kidnap her.

228
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,720
She deserves that fate.

229
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,039
You can't go rescue her.

230
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,039
Young Master,

231
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:28,360
after it is settled,

232
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,399
I'll be at your disposal.

233
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:33,919
Young Master.

234
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,480
If your father

235
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,440
does not surrender the three cities,

236
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,679
tomorrow

237
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,759
will be your death day.

238
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,600
But before that,

239
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,679
I need you two to

240
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:05,200
serve as military prostitutes

241
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:07,639
for my men and me

242
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
for a few days.

243
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:11,159
Great.

244
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:14,679
If you dare touch
even one finger of mine,

245
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,399
Linzhao's troops

246
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,080
will trample Xuanhuang,

247
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,759
leaving you with no burial place.

248
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:26,200
Leaving us with no burial place?

249
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:30,720
Why don't you let us
have some fun first?
