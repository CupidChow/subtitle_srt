General Mu's eyes are not in serious.

21
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:04,000
It'll be fine.

22
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:05,680
It won't delay the wedding.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,079

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,199
(The current strategy)

34
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,120
(is to marry Princess Fuyu)

35
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,199
(so as to get closer to His Majesty.)

36
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:44,400

Wait, Father.

193
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:45,440
This matter was acted solely by me.

194
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:46,360
I am the one

195
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:47,960
who deserves to be punished.

196
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:48,879
Please release...

197
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:50,039
You can't protect yourself,

198
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:52,039
yet you're pleading for him.

199
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,120
Do you truly believe

200
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,759
I will always indulge you?

201
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:58,360
Report!

202
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,080
Your Majesty.

203
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,200
The Crown Prince

204
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,519
of Zhuyan, Yan Shi'an is here.

205
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:05,600
Let him in.

206
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,519
Yes.

207
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,039
It's good

208
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:14,879
to see you,

209
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,440
Your Majesty.

210
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,200
Your Highness,

211
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,080
Wen Yanshu

212
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,279
is your wife.

213
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:24,159
She escaped marriage

214
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,759
and took Fuyu's husband

215
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:27,720
in front of everyone.

216
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,320
It not only

217
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:31,240
brings shame upon you,

218
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:32,399
but also concerns

219
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:33,919
our diplomatic relations.

220
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:34,919
Your Highness,

221
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,279
how do you want to handle it?

222
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,600
Your Majesty.

223
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:40,200
I heard that Mu Han was

224
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,799
mutually in love

225
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:44,080
with Princess Royal as a toyboy.

226
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:47,000
I can't stand

227
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:48,799
seeing lovers separated.

228
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:51,080
So I planned this wedding hijack.

229
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,120
Your Highness,
no need to cover for Yanshu.

230
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:54,919
She has always been willful.

231
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,399
I'm afraid

232
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:58,360
even you were also deceived.

233
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:00,679
Your Majesty.

234
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,759
I come here today

235
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,720
for another matter.

236
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:05,000
I want to annul the engagement.
