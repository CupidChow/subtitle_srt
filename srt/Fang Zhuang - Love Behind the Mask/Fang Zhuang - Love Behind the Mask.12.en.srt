Killing Lord of Zishang

5
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,799

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,400
I made him do it.

11
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:17,200
Lord of Zishang secretly offered

12
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,560
sacrifices to rebel spirits.

13
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,000
Shouldn't we kill him?

Killing Lord of Zishang

16
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:24,519
deserves death.

are you trying to cover for him?

Brother,

22
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,400
I'm not covering for him,

23
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:41,239

00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:46,319

kill Lord of Zishang, right?

26
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,359
Can we go now?

27
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,000

Not bad.
