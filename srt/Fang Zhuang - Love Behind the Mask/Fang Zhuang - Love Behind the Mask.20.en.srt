=Episode 20=

3
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:43,679
I want to annul the engagement.

4
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:50,719
Annul it?

5
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,600
You just said

6
00:00:58,759 --> 00:00:59,880
the incident

7
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:01,679
was your plan all along.

8
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:03,960
Indeed,

9
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:06,079
you have a kind heart.

10
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,359
Although you two

11
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:10,079
held no formal ceremony,

12
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:11,439
nominally,

13
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,840
she is still your wife.

14
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:15,239
Is canceling engagement

15
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,519
really

16
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,359
showing such disregard for us?

17
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,239
If Your Majesty agrees with me today,

18
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:22,719
I will offer Linzhao

19
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:24,760
double the benefits.

20
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:26,760
How about it?

21
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,719
It seems

22
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:45,159
this marriage really
won't come to fruition.

23
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,599
Alright.

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,239
Since it's like this,

25
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,640
I consent the matter

26
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,439
of annulment.

27
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,359
Father.

28
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,560
Mu Han...

29
00:01:58,599 --> 00:01:59,599
Your Majesty is kind.

30
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:01,760
You don't want to separate
the couple forever?

31
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:03,719
Why not grant my wish

32
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,560
to release Mu Han?

33
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:06,680
If Linzhao faces difficulty,

34
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:08,199
I will

35
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:10,639
help with all resources.

36
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,240
Alright.

37
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:15,159
Today,

38
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:17,280
for your sake,

39
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,800
I spare his life.

40
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,319
Thank you.

41
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:23,680
That's it.

42
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,159
All of you leave.

43
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,759
I am tired.

44
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:28,479
Thank you, Father.

45
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,520
Thank you.

46
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,560
Report!

47
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,080
Your Majesty.

48
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,439
Recently,

49
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,639
people are complaining.

50
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,919
The families
of those sacrificial maidens

51
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:52,520
are to file a joint petition.

52
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:54,240
I...

53
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,120
The dead

54
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:58,039
won't file a joint petition.

55
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:58,680
Yes.

56
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:08,080
Shi'an,

57
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:09,240
last night...

58
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,000
Anning,

59
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,000
save it.

60
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,280
But you break off the engagement,

61
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:15,599
your father...

62
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:17,639
Don't worry.

63
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,199
I have my own ways.

64
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,639
Now seeing you safe,

65
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:23,639
I am at ease.

66
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,080
Go find him.

67
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:27,039
Okay.

68
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,080
Yan Shi'an.

69
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,199
Are you unhappy?

70
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:41,479
What happened to you?

71
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:42,080
Princess Jiyao,

72
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,919
if there's nothing, I'll leave.

73
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:46,520
What's wrong?

74
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,599
You are upset about what?

75
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,800
Don't feel bad.

76
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,360
I know

77
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,159
Wen Yanshu made a fool of you.

78
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:52,256
- So you're upset.
- Okay!

79
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,919
Stop following me!

80
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:58,159
Is it alright if I don't say anything?

81
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,039
Oh, don't be angry.

82
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,400
I'm very familiar with here.

83
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,599
I'll take you out to relax.

84
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,720
Does it hurt?

85
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:33,279
No.

86
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:37,600
Don't disobey

87
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,120
His Majesty for me again.

88
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:43,000
What if he wants to kill you?

89
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:45,199
For you,

90
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:46,839
I can do anything.

91
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:48,600
Even if it costs my life,

92
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,199
I wouldn't hesitate.

93
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,279
Shu,

94
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,680
listen.

95
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,079
In this world,

96
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:01,839
you are more important than anyone.

97
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:04,720
I am not worth such effort.

98
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,079
You are.

99
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,959
How are your injuries?

100
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,439
Nothing serious.

101
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:36,639
This is...

102
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:39,240
What a pity.

103
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,319
The vendor said

104
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,160
this is unique in the world.

105
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,800
I will never find another one.

106
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:50,519
If you really like it,

107
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,560
I can fix it for you.

108
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:57,959
By the way,
it's the festival tonight.

109
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,720
Let's go see the lanterns.

110
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:00,839
Lanterns?

111
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,000
Yes.

112
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,199
It's said that that festival

113
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,680
originated in Jiangling.

114
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,920
Couples who release lanterns

115
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:09,839
can be together for life.

116
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:15,879
Today's lantern festival
is really lively.

117
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,240
How beautiful my lantern is.

118
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,680
Hurry up!

119
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,240
Let's go there.

120
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:25,199
Wait for me!

121
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,120
Let's also release lanterns.

122
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:46,879
Yan Shi'an,

123
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,000
you're so fast.

124
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,199
It's not a walk anymore.

125
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:51,199
I'll tell you one last time.

126
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,079
Don't follow me anymore.

127
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,920
Otherwise, don't blame
me for being rude.

128
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,720
I don't believe you'll do that.

129
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:58,800
We

130
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,439
are walking.

131
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:00,959
Swallow it before speaking.

132
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,639
No,

133
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,439
you're so pitiful alone.

134
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,639
I'm so good to you.

135
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:12,720
Yet you're still angry.

136
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:13,759
I can give

137
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,079
the candied haws to you.

138
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,279

174
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,279
I cannot stay long here.

175
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:11,519
I will return soon.

176
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,360
If you encounter any trouble,

177
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,759
just have someone
take it back to Zhuyan.

178
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,919
You can mobilize half of my forces.

179
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:23,480
Shi'an,

180
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,639
thank you.

181
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,600
Mu Han is not a good person.

182
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,679
This marriage alliance

183
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,759
was entirely orchestrated by him.

184
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:36,720
(Now I can be at ease.)

185
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,360

188
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,799
could you

189
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,120
help me with one more thing?

190
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:47,440
Alright.

191
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,080

192
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,039

recently, Xuanhuang is stirring.

194
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,799
I shall lead troops to battle

195
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,320
to relieve your worries.

196
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:09,840
Good.

197
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,879
You are to relieve my worries.

198
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,440
Do you know

199
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:15,840
that Xuanhuang is now
strong and powerful,

200
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,360
while we

201
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:19,519
have not had a war for many years?

202
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:21,519
How much chance do you have

203
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:22,960
of winning Xuanhuang?

204
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:24,799
I have thought of a strategy.

205
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,720
We can ask Zhuyan for help.

206
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,320
Our two states share weal or woe.

207
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:30,080
I believe their Crown Prince

208
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,159
will agree.

209
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:31,799
Okay.

210
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,919
Since it's like this,

211
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:33,840
I agree.

212
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:36,399
If you can destroy Xuanhuang,

213
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,320
you'll eliminate a major concern
from my mind.

214
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:40,720
If you win,

215
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:42,120
I will reward you.

216
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,039
Thank you for your favor.

217
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,399
General Mu,

218
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,360
I think Yanshu is not sincere

219
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,600
towards you.

220
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,240
Love is something

221
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,399
that two people

222
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,799
willingly embark on,

223
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,240
and I won't regret it.

224
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:13,720
I know Yanshu

225
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:15,279
better than anyone.

226
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:16,960
She is fickle

227
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,200
and favors beauties.

228
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:20,039
To her, you

229
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,679
are no different from those

230
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:22,879
toyboys.

231
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:25,120
I suppose right now,

232
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,399
she must be affectionate with
the Crown Prince

233
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:29,120
of Zhuyan.

234
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:32,039
Please speak cautiously.

235
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,960
You can go

236
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,200
and see for yourself.

237
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:45,320
Your Highness,

238
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,440
take it easy.

239
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,759
You really do not cherish beauty.

240
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,639
Compared to General Mu,

241
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,679
which one of us is better?

242
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:55,000
Of course, you.
