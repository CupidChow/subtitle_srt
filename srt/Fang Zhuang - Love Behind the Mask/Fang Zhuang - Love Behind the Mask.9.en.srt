00:00:39,744 --> 00:00:41,312
=Episode 9=

3
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:43,240
My dog is lost.

4
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:44,560
I come to look for it.

5
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,200
I shall take my leave.

6
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:49,240
Wait.

7
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,399
Here, take this.

8
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:55,880
If you've made up your mind,

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,079
find me with it.

10
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,000
Green jade for a hypocritee.

11
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,880
What a perfect match!

12
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,799
But why do I see it

13
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,799
as purple?

14
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:12,040
Yes.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,799
It is indeed purple.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,920
Perhaps

17
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,680
your eyes are not good enough.

18
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,239
Goodbye.

19
00:01:34,871 --> 00:01:37,655
(Princess Royal's Mansio)

20
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:43,599
You were at Wen Fuyu's place
for a long time.

21
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,040
What did you do?

22
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,280
What did you say?

23
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:50,280
Your Highness,

24
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:53,560
I just went to have a cup of tea.

25
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,480
Liar!

26
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,840
You enjoy being at her place so much.

27
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:00,359
Is it because you like her?

28
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:02,840
Or have you become addicted
to being a toyboy?

29
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,799
Your Highness,

30
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:04,920
I haven't.

31
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:07,719
Kneel.

32
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,560
Without my permission,

33
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,680
do not get up.

34
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:27,520
Well,

35
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:30,879
look at you, Guard Mu Han.

36
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,080
I heard

37
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,159
you shamelessly went
to see Princess Fuyu.

38
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,879
What?

39
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,400
This place

40
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,280
is not good enough for you?

41
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:53,280
Stop it right now.

42
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,840
Don't look at me like that.

43
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,360
Even though you are a guard in name,

44
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:02,000
actually,

45
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,599
you are just a toyboy
for the Princess Royal.

46
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,879
What?

47
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,719
Do you want to kill me?

48
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,639
Are you mad?

49
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:51,919
You killed my people at my place.

50
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:00,800
He worked for the Marquis.

51
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,759
Don't you know that?

52
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,599
Yes, I'm vicious.

53
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,719
But you've taught me to be like that.

54
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:40,199
Marquis is here.

55
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,240
Shu,

56
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,560
His Majesty orders me to visit Zhuyan.

57
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,040
I applied

58
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:52,800
to have Guard Mu accompany me.

59
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,720
Did you do that for private grudges?

60
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:57,120
Don't joke.

61
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,399
We all know

62
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:00,120
Guard Mu killed Qiya.

63
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:02,120
His skills are clearly impressive.

64
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:04,120
With his presence,

65
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:05,319
we'll succeed effortlessly.

66
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,439
Don't you agree?

67
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:08,040
Okay.

68
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,120
But I'll go with him.

69
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:13,720
Shu,

70
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,720
don't do that.

71
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,800
You know

72
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,040
it's perilous outside.

73
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,439
He is mine.

74
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:20,160
So of course, he obeys my orders.

75
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:21,680
Shu,

76
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:23,879
do you truly trust him so much?

77
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,439
You even indulged him

78
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,160
in killing Xueyan.

79
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,759
Now that you know it,

80
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,040
don't send people

81
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:33,759
to spy on me anymore.

82
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,800
I hate being spied on.

83
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,519
With Guard Mu around,

84
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,120
you don't need to go with me.

85
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:42,160
But His Majesty...

86
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:42,800
Remember.

87
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,560
You work for me.

88
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:06,040
Marquis is here.

89
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:10,240
Brother?

90
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:18,920
Brother.

91
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:27,759
Why are you here?

92
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:30,920
I heard Zhuyan is incredibly beautiful.

93
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,160
I asked Her Majesty to let me go along.

94
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:33,920
What?

95
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,160
Is there anything wrong?

96
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,839
I made some pastries myself.

97
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:41,279
Guard Mu, why not get on my carriage

98
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,480
and try some?

99
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,519
No need.

100
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,759
I'll ride my horse.

101
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,160
Marquis,

102
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:54,879
since Guard Mu is going to ride a horse,

103
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,639
why don't you ride my carriage?

104
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,160
Your Highness,

105
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,360
it's very thoughtful of you.

106
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:17,439
I'm flattered.

107
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,199
Your cooking is surprisingly good.

108
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:32,800
It's just a humble hobby.

109
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:34,319
I didn't expect it

110
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:36,319
to arouse your interest.

111
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,439
Your Highness, you have turned
all young noblemen away

112
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,720
but only have cared for a mere guard.

113
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,839
I find it

114
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,560
very odd.

115
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:02,480
Sister.

116
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:07,079
What's the matter?

117
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:08,360
Broken carriage?

118
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,360
I know

119
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,759
you don't want me to ride
in the same carriage with you.

120
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Then I will reluctantly

121
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:17,160
ride a horse with Guard Mu.

122
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,319
Ride in my carriage.

123
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,319
I have many heartfelt words

124
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:24,079
to share with you.

125
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:26,759
Please, Your Highness.

126
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,079
Marquis,

127
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:31,279
let's hurry on the road.

128
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:32,519
It's getting late.

129
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:37,559
Guard Mu,

130
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,360
why does your clothing
look so much like Shu's?

131
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,600
My clothing

132
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:44,600
was personally tailored by Shu
as a mistress and servant outfit.

133
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,519
What?

134
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:47,279
Do you also want a piece of it

135
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,519
to experience the feeling
of being a servant?

136
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:53,399
In the future,

137
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:55,399
we will only wear red

138
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,840
so we won't see the blood.

139
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:01,559
At the next post,

140
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,159
I will buy another horse.

141
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:05,240
It's getting late.

142
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,600
We'd better hurry.

143
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,639
Giddy-up!

144
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:20,799
Shu,

145
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,320
I have already

146
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,879
driven away all the idle people

147
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,120
for you.

148
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,519
Why didn't you

149
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,039
tell me you are visiting Zhuyan?

150
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,360
Why are you following us?

151
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,960
Everyone in Linzhao knows

152
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,679
my mother is the princess of Zhuyan.

153
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:43,919
What are the benefits

154
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,240
if we take you with us?

155
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,039
There are many benefits.

156
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:48,519
Pick.

157
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:49,840
Pick one, each of you.

158
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:55,879
You go first.

159
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,960
I'll pick for him.

160
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:22,480
I'll pick this one.

161
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:24,559
My eyes

162
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:26,000
can only see red.

163
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:27,879
I'm so scared.

164
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,000
Isn't this your favorite color?

165
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,159
Guard Mu likes the same color as I do.

166
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,159
I'll take it for him.

167
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,279
Pick another one.

168
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,320
This one.

169
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:05,200
Red is festive.

170
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:06,759
Okay.

171
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:09,559
(Could it be)

172
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,759
(that I was overthinking it?)

173
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:17,840
Shu,

174
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,679
I need to talk to you.

175
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:21,399
Let's go.

176
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:30,960
Brother,

177
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,399
you're hurting me.

178
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:35,360
Shu,

179
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:37,399
you've been acting weird lately.

180
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:38,879
Why is that?

181
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,360
(Did I give away something)

182
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,440
(due to Mu Han's influence)

183
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,440
(and arouse his suspicion?)

184
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:46,720
Weird?

185
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:49,919
I don't know what you're saying.

186
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,000
Ever since we returned
from Zishang State,

187
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:55,320
you've become distant towards me.

188
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,080
And your daily behavior

189
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:58,720
is not like usual.

190
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,440
In this world,

191
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,840
no one can remain unchanged.

192
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:04,480
Besides,

193
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:05,960
does love

194
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,759
