00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:42,560
I'm sorry

4
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:44,600
for not fulfilling

5
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:46,679
my duties of marriage.

6
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,439
I've been in love with someone.

7
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,039
I will repay you

8
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:54,159
what I owe you.

9
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:07,239
My lord,

10
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,959
concerning Miss Wangyou...

11
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:11,840
Without my orders,

12
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:13,640
she is not allowed to step out.

13
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,400
Yes.

14
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:22,560
Let me out.

15
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,120
Let me out.

16
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,760
Miss Wangyou,

17
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:30,400
without permission,

18
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,280
you are not allowed to leave.

19
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:33,760
You...

20
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:42,159
I want to see him.

21
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:49,159
My lord,

22
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,920
Miss Wangyou wants to see you.

23
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:52,760
No.

24
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,200
No?

25
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,439
Miss Wangyou,

26
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:05,560
you haven't eaten anything for a day.

27
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:07,280
If this continues,

28
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:08,879
your body won't hold up.

29
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,439
Tell Mu Han.

30
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:11,800
If he doesn't show up,

31
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:13,280
I will continue my hunger strike.

32
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:26,840
My lord,

33
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,639
Miss Wangyou says if you don't show up,

34
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:31,039
she'll refuse to eat.

35
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:32,039
How about

36
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:33,919
seeing her?

37
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,400
No.

38
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,319
Why are you doing so?

39
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,319
You clearly care so much.

40
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:41,080
Why torture each other?

41
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,719
I don't dare to see her.

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,039
I'm afraid of losing control
and hurting her

43
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:49,000
when I see her.

44
00:02:58,964 --> 00:03:01,696
(Princess Royal's Mansion)

45
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,439
He won't show up.

46
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,199
Why torture yourself here?

47
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:13,319
Let me help you leave.

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,879
You will help me?

49
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,919
How will you help me?

50
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,719
Here is some medicine.

51
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,840
After taking it,

52
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,400
you will lose breath overnight.

53
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:33,560
But it won't be deadly.

54
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,400
If you really want to leave,

55
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:36,800
take this medicine

56
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:37,840
and fake your death

57
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,000
to escape from the palace.

58
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:41,800
Why should I trust you?

59
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,400
What if it is poisonous?

60
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,439
If I truly wanted to harm you,

61
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:47,199
I wouldn't need to go through this.

62
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,240
I'll leave it here.

63
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,960
It's up to you whether you take it.

64
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:57,439
By the way,

65
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:02,280
if you don't want to leave,
that's fine too.

66
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,000
You can stay here.

67
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,240
Some days later,

68
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,879
welcome to join our wedding.

69
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:35,680
Miss Wangyou.

70
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:36,879
Miss Wangyou.

71
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:39,240
Summon the imperial physician!

73
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,319
What happened?

74
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,800
Although her face is pale,

75
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,720
her breathing's steady.

76
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,920
It's obvious she's faking it.

77
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,120
Everyone, step back.

78
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:02,759
Yes.

79
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,079
She...

80
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,639
Stop pretending.

81
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,120
Get up.

82
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:23,720
I...

83
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,439
Why are you pretending
to be ill and fainting?

84
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,920
Do you want to leave me that badly?

85
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,439
What's wrong?

86
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:33,560
Why do you imprison me?

87
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,040
I told you,

88
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:41,720
whether you remember it or not,

89
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,279
you are Wen Yanshu.

90
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:46,040
Why? I'm not her.

91
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:48,439
Because I look like that woman?

92
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,800
Besides, you have a fiancée.

93
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,959
Why can't you let me go?

94
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:51,959
She is dead.

95
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:52,839
Fine.

96
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,160
You don't remember?

97
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,199
Let me help you.

98
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:57,959
Let go of me.

99
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:58,959
Let go of me.

100
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,720
Look.

101
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,920
These are all what you loved most.

102
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:06,720
Do you remember anything?

103
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:08,120
Do you remember?

104
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,800
Even if you make me wear her clothes

105
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,000
and put on her hairpin,

106
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,560
it can't help.

107
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:16,480
I said I am not her.

108
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:17,480
She is dead.

109
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,000
And she will never come back!

110
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,519

to say it a second time!

Don't hurt Shi'an.

120
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,439
It's not his fault.

121
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,319
I'll wear it.

122
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,439
I'll wear it.

123
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,439
I'll do as you say.

124
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,160

(Princess Royal's Mansion)

195
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,279
Shu,

196
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,799
calm down.

197
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:52,440
Lotus soup is good for calming mind.

198
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,080
Try it.

199
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,720
No.

200
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,399
Shu,

201
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,559
haven't we made a deal?

202
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,360
You would stay by my side.

203
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,559
Why do you have to force her?

204
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:12,840
Wangyou,

205
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,120
these are your favorite pastries

206
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,480
from Zhuyan.

207
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:17,799
Try it.

208
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,720
The imperial physician advised

209
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:25,960
her

210
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,799
not eat too many sweets.

211
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:30,519
Wangyou has always liked eating sweets.

212
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:33,039
You may not know it.

213
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,639
She just had lotus soup.

214
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,879
Can't you understand me?

215
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,519
Unlike you,

216
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,879
I don't talk the talk of doing good,

217
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,840
while pushing her
to do things she dislikes.

218
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:49,279
You...

219
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:50,679
Stop arguing!

220
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:53,039
Sit down.

221
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,120
Shu.

222
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:15,000
Wangyou.

223
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:16,399
Shi'an.

224
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,000
I'll take you away.

225
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,039
I'll promise you anything

226
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,120
if you go with me.

227
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,759
Sorry,

228
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,279
I don't want to be your wife

229
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:25,919
or anyone's substitute.

230
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,399
I just want to be myself.

231
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:28,440
Trust me.

232
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,440
I won't trap you anymore.

233
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,039
Come back with me.

234
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:42,440
What's up?

235
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,000
I came here just to tell you

236
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:48,279
why Yan Shi'an cares about you.

237
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:51,840
He only sees you as Wen Yanshu.

238
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,960
So from the beginning to the end,

239
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,639
in your eyes,

240
00:11:55,879 --> 00:11:57,279
I am always a substitute for her.

241
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:57,799
Am I right?

242
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,639
No,

243
00:11:58,639 --> 00:11:59,720
you are not a substitute.
