2
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,088
=Episode 21=

3
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,399
Wen Yanshu!

4
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:55,479
Why?

5
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,359
Didn't you see it all?

6
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:01,799
I don't believe you had an affair.

7
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:04,560
Shu,

8
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,760
tell me if you have any difficulties.

9
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,719
We will face it together

10
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,560
instead of torturing me like this.

11
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:15,359
Mu Han,

12
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,519
you hated me so much at that time,

13
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,599
and you plotted for me

14
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:21,719
to marry for alliance.

15
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:22,680
How come

16
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:25,159
you've fallen in love with me now?

17
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,879
We fell in love at first sight

18
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:30,079
when we were in Zhuyan.

19
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:32,000
She disrupted your marriage.

20
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:34,439
It's nothing but taking revenge
on Wen Fuyu.

21
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,280
By the way,

22
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,799
and you.

23
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,959
Mu Han,

24
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,560
look at you now.

25
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,719
Interesting.

26
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,520
Are you okay?

27
00:02:20,921 --> 00:02:24,384
(Prosperity Court)

28
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:25,039
Anning,

29
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:26,800
Father is critically ill.

30
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,120
Uncle is eyeing the throne.

31
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:30,879
I can't stay here long.

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,759
I understand.

33
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,639
Shi'an,

34
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,439
hope we are both safe

35
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,840
when we meet again.

36
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:42,280
Anning,

37
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,159
how wonderful it would be
if we could still live

38
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,599
the old life.

39
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:55,639
Trust me.

40
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:58,159
I will take you away from here.

41
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,159
All will be over soon.

42
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,759
One day,

43
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:05,919
we will reunite.

44
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:21,759
I really hate Wen Yanshu.

45
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,159
What should I do

46
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:24,840
to make her disappear from my sight?

47
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,520
Alright.

48
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,032
- Since childhood,
- Fuyu.

49
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,199
she took Father's love from me.

50
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:31,400
Now

51
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,520
she took my husband.

52
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:35,240
Didn't she go to marry for alliance?

53
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,080
Why did she come back?

54
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,000
Why doesn't she just die?

55
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,120
Pass down the order!

56
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:43,400
Have Wen Yanshu come see me!

57
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:44,800
Yes.

58
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,560
Alright.

59
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,639
The Empress definitely
had an ulterior motive

60
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:59,520
when she called me this time.

61
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,520
I must find a way to escape.

62
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:04,960
Go report to my Father

63
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:05,960
and tell him

64
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,400
the Empress summoned me.

65
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:09,479
Make the situation sound more serious.

66
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,199
Yes.

67
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,519
Your Majesty.

68
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,120
Yanshu,

69
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,759
you snatched your sister's
husband in public,

70
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,920
causing her to lose face.

71
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:45,480
Do you have no remorse?

72
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,959
She sent someone
to assassinate me but failed.

73
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:50,680
Now she asks you for help.

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,959
Wen Yanshu,

75
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:55,959
you've done so many bad things

76
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,639
but haven't been punished.

77
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,600
Even though I hate you deeply...

78
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,800
Wen Fuyu,

79
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,519
where does your hate come from?

80
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,920
Did I order you to let people bully me

81
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,720
and snatch my people

82
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,800
to put me to death?

83
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:09,480
Or did I teach you to be bad

84
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,720
to make you a villain?

85
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,680
That's all your strength?

86
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:23,480
She is your sister.

87
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:26,360
It's right for you to yield to her.

88
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,600
Alright.

89
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:32,319
Since that's the case,

90
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,560
I'm tired of General Mu too.

91
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:36,959
If you like,

92
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,279
I'll give you.

93
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:39,360
I don't mind.

94
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:42,759
Fuyu is weak by nature.

95
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,160
Stop saying such hurtful things.

96
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,240
The reason I called both of you here

97
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,040
is just to see how well

98
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,600
you get along with each other.

99
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:55,079
Your Majesty.

100
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,480
You have caught a cold.

101
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,600
Please take medicine.

102
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,800
Shu,

103
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,199
come to serve me.

104
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Once reinforcements
from Zhuyan State arrive,

105
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,680
you can then lead the armies to battle.

106
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:43,720
I accept

107
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,560
the order.

108
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
But I have another request.

109
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,800
The people have experienced war.

110
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:50,120
They are filled with fear.

111
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,560
I ask Your Majesty

112
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:52,879
to go to the battlefield.

113
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:55,120
Both the common people and the soldiers

114
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,000
can be resolute.

115
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:57,920
I

116
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,399
will do my utmost

117
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,600
to protect you.

118
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:02,360
General Mu,

119
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:03,839
I remind you

120
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,519
not to cause trouble for me.

121
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,319
Your life and death

122
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,879
are controlled by me.

123
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,079
I

124
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:15,120
wholeheartedly think of Linzhao

125
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,680
without ulterior motives.

126
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:19,160
Your Majesty.

127
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,759
The guard reported

128
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,639
the Princess Royal has been taken

129
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,720
by the Empress.

130
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:39,439
Mother.

131
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:42,240
If you are willing to show mercy now,

132
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,519
from now on,

133
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:45,279
my sister and I

134
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,639
will live in harmony.

135
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,120
Yanshu,

136
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:50,040
you will not understand.

137
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:52,040
Parents' love for their child

138
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,000
knows no bounds.

139
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,120
I understand.

140
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,079
This...

141
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,240
For this unworthy daughter,

142
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,160
you even used yourself as bait.

143
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,959
What a pity.

144
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:19,879
I know quite a bit of medicine.

145
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,480
I am afraid I will disappoint you.

146
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:29,720
Mother.

147
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,040
What should we do?

148
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,480
His Majesty arrives.

149
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,679
Father.

150
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,480
Father, they...

151
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,679
Father.

152
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,480
I...

153
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:45,679
Your Majesty.

154
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,600
Why did you punish me
without asking any questions?

155
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:52,080
Wouldn't I know

156
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,759
my daughter?

157
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,120
Am I not your daughter?

158
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,159
Father.

159
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,840
Have you ever cared about me?

160
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:02,799
I am the supreme princess

161
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,799
who should receive
all the love in the world.

162
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:08,519
But why have you never cared about me

163
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:10,879
and never believe what I say?

164
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,679
I only trust my own judgment.

165
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,120
Guards!

166
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,399
Take her

167
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:17,360
away!

168
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:18,200
Your Majesty.

169
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:19,360
Please calm down.

170
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,639
Your Majesty.

171
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:22,000
I was the one

172
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,679
who poisoned her.

173
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,200
It has nothing to do with Fuyu.

174
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,559
Your Majesty,

175
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,000
for the sake of our many years
of marriage,

176
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,600
spare Fuyu.

177
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:31,360
Mother.

178
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,799
It has nothing to do with Fuyu.

179
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,840
Is what your mother said

180
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,519
true?

181
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:38,320
I...

182
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,879
Yes.

183
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,200
From this day on,

184
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:53,320
seal Fengqi Palace.

185
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,679
The Empress

186
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,639
is not allowed to leave
without an edict.

187
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,759
Yes.

188
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:00,559
Shu.

189
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:03,240
Shu.

190
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:05,399
Shu.

191
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:07,879
Call the imperial physician!

192
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,799
I'm afraid she...

193
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,919
I don't want to hear any bad news.

194
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:17,879
Hurry up and speak!

195
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,440
Her Highness is poisoned severely.

196
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:20,679

born at the time of Yin

as a guide.

199
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:24,840
Why are you standing here?

200
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,919

You may leave.

Yes.

211
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,879
Are you feeling better?

212
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:02,639
Since you hate me,

213
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,600
why bother to save me?

214
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
