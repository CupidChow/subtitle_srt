Me?

14
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:45,519
I'm the one who'll take your life.

15
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:49,640
I will kill each one of you
who commits violence and brutality

16
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,239
to avenge the hundreds of wronged souls
of the Lord of Zishang's Mansion.

17
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:56,640
Including your father, the emperor.

18
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,200
You're quite a big talker.

19
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,200
Little girl,

20
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:04,719
do you have the ability?

21
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,359
I have no way out.

22
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:09,120
You want to kill the emperor?

23
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,360
Alright.

24
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,840
Maybe I can

25
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:15,639
help you.

26
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:17,520
What did you say?

27
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:20,400
The emperor is your father.

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,039
His favor towards you
is known all over the world.

29
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,439
Yes.

30
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,400
He gave me the highest status

31
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,719
and endless wealth and glory.

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,400
But he also gave me

33
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:37,240
pain worse than death

34
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:40,960
and endless torment day and night.

35
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:43,919
Guess

36
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,360
where his invulnerable blood spirit

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,080
came from.

38
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,439
It came
from sacrificing my mother's life.

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,039
He treats me well

40
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,240
only because
I can enhance his blood spirit.

41
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:03,639
He rewards me with toyboys

42
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,319
because

43
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,879
I can bear a child for him.

44
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:11,800
The day I give birth to a child

45
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,639
will be the day I am sacrificed.

46
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,599
Brother, the blood.

47
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,319
We can cooperate.

48
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:36,879
Tell me.

49
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,039
How do you want to take revenge?

50
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:52,840
I want

51
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:55,120
to become you.

52
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:01,960
Alright, I'll let you.

53
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:05,159
And you

54
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,960
need to give me freedom.

55
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,400
Won't you regret it?

56
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,479
I will never regret it.

You should leave.

75
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,360
But I must remind you

76
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,519
that if you
reveal our secret to the world,

77

in an isolated place

82
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:58,000
and spend our lives together.

87
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,040
what happened?

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,040

how are you?

92
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,160
I am here.

93
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:58,199
Don't be afraid.

94
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,040
It was close.

95
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,000
(It was close.)

96
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,639
(It was so close)

97
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:17,800
(that we could)

98
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,360
(be free.)

99
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:39,480
Your Highness, we've dismissed

100
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:40,959
the toyboys as you ordered.

101
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:43,120
Okay.

102
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,959
You can leave too.

103
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:49,600
Your Highness,

104
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,399
the emperor broke his promise

105
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,759
and killed my sister.

106
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,120
In the past,

107
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,920
to protect my sister's life,

108
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,360
my hands

109
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,519
were stained with blood.

110
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,040
Your Highness,

111
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,879
his blood spirit is weakening,

112
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,399
and you have no child.

113
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,079
He'll surely sacrifice you.

114
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,839
Don't drive me away.

115
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,000
Let me stay by your side

116
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,040
to guard you,

117
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,560
okay?

118
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,519
You want to stay by my side

119
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,319
to take revenge, right?

120
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:24,040
Get up.

121
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:25,279
Prepare the horses.

122
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,560
Let's enter the palace.

123
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:29,480

Your Majesty,

125
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,159
Princess Royal is here.

126
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:45,840
Father.

127
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,000
Father, tomorrow's
Mother's death anniversary.

128
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,919
I'll prepare a banquet at my place

129
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,519
and want to invite you over.

130
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:57,960
Shu,

131
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,399
your mother has been dead
for many years.

132
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:04,399
I am afraid you can't even remember
what she looked like.

133
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:06,799
But

134
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,960
I lost my mother at a young age.

135
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,840
My mansion has long been built,

136
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,679
but you have never been there.

137
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,759
My huge mansion

138
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,960
is always cold and cheerless.

139
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,600
I have taught you.

140
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:21,960
You need to give up

141
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,120
the sentiments

142
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,759
to achieve great things.

143
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:27,600
Father,

144
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,240
just say yes.

145
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:31,200
Just this once.

146
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:35,039
Look at you.

147
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:37,080
Okay.

148
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:38,440
Tomorrow,

149
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,919
I will be there.

150
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:41,279
Thank you, Father.

151
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,080
Shadow Guard.

152
00:09:59,279 --> 00:09:59,919
Yes?

153
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,919
Take a squad of elite soldiers

154
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:03,320
to infiltrate her mansion.

155
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:05,440
When I am there tomorrow,

156
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,279
if there is anything unusual,

157
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,480
kill without mercy.

158
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:09,080
Understood.

159
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,879
Everyone, leave.

160
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,200
Yes, Your Highness.

161
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,000
You may leave.

162
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,200
You can stay.

163
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,360
I came here just to tell you

164
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:53,320
my father

165
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,120
is now at Yanshu's place.

166
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:15,279
You few stay here.

167
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:16,879
No one is allowed to enter.

168
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,480
Yes.

169
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,639
Tyrant,

170
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,919
I can finally take your life.

171
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,159
Shu,

172
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:42,840
do you want

173
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:46,840
to go against me, your own father?

174
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,559
My father?

175
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,080
My father

176
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:53,759
died long ago in that massacre
at the Lord of Zishang's Mansion.

177
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,440
You are...

178

No matter who you are,

if you dare to kill me,
