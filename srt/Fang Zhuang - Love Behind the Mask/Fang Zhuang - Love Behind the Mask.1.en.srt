1
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:39,419
=Love Behind the Mask=

2
00:00:39,591 --> 00:00:41,358
=Episode 1=

3
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,359
Her Royal Highness is here.

4
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,799
Make way.

5
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,560
Disperse!

6
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:53,280
Why is she making such a big show?

7
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,359
What does she want now?

8
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,600
The Princess Royal is debauched.

9
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,079
She likes handsome men.

10
00:00:58,439 --> 00:00:59,799
Her mansion is full of toyboys.

11
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,000
I guess

12
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,280
she took a fancy

13
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,079
to Princess Liangyin's ghost husband.

14
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,519
I heard that the ghost husband

15
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:06,920
has unparalleled beauty.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,560
The whole capital has heard about it.

17
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,599
(I am the ghost husband
they are talking about.)

18
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:12,879
(Mu Han)
(I'm Mu Han.)

19
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,599
(But I have another identity
that must be deeply hidden:)

20
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,519
(Lord of Zishang's Son, Si Yichen)
(Lord of Zishang's son,)

21
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:23,120
(Si Yichen.)

22
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,879
(Three months ago, Zishang State)
(Three months ago,)

23
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:26,719
(on the night of my wedding,)

24
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,120
(fearing the power
of Zishang State, the emperor)

25
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,340
(sent Princess Royal Wen Yanshu)

26
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,480
(to annihilate
my entire family overnight.)

27
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,136
(Lord of Zishang)
Hide my son in the secret passage now.

28
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:35,799
(Lady of Zishang)

29
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:37,439
(To protect the Si family's bloodline,)

30
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,680
(my father had my master
seal my acupoints)

31
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:41,959
(and hid me in the secret passage.)

32
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,680
(Hang Zhan, Si Yichen's Master)
(I survived the massacre)

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,879
(but also witnessed my dearest ones)

34
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,519
(being brutally killed one by one
before my eyes.)

35
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,599
Execute the entire families
of Hang Zhan, General Zhenbei,

36
00:01:58,599 --> 00:01:59,799
and Lord of Zishang!

37
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,120
(Lord of Zishang's Memorial Tablet)
(That night,)

38
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,760
(the joyful red curtains
were stained black by the massacre.)

39
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,719
(The mansion of Lord of Zishang,
who killed countless enemies)

40
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:11,639
(and defended the borders
for the country for decades,)

41
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,599
(was covered with corpses and blood.)

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,080
(Then, the feet that trampled
on my parents' blood)

43
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,159
(appeared in front of me.)

44
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:25,599
(She was attracted by the smell
of blood like a hungry wolf,)

45
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,319
(playing recklessly
with my parents' blood.)

46
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,240
(She looked both intoxicated)

47
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,159
(and insane.)

48
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:35,800
(It made me remember that face)

49
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,680
(of the person
I have a vendetta against,)

50
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,199
(Princess Royal Wen Yanshu)
(Princess Royal Wen Yanshu.)

51
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,719
It's snowing.

52
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:49,080
Greetings, Your Royal Highness.

53
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,599
(Coming from Zishang State
to the capital)

54
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,919
(and becoming the ghost husband
of a prematurely deceased princess...)

55
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,400
I want

56
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,560
the man in this sedan.

57
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,560
(It's the quickest way for me
to get close to my enemy.)

58
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:06,680
Your Royal Highness,

59
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,960
that's improper.

60
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,919
The man in this sedan chair
is Princess Liangyin's ghost husband.

61
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:11,800
Get lost.

62
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:16,479
(Wen Yanshu is debauched)

63
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,719
(and addicted to men.)

64
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:20,599
(She's obsessed
with collecting toyboys everywhere.)

65
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:22,960
(As expected, she came.)

66
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,240
(Tonight)

67
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,919
(is the best chance
for me to kill my enemy.)

68
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,400
It's very inauspicious.

69
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,840
Princess!

70
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,719
What's your name?

71
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:34,520
Mu Han.

72
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,800
You are mine now.

73
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,680
Your Royal Highness, you mustn't...

74
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:47,280
A ghost's sedan chair

75
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,719
is not as comfortable as my sedan chair.

76
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,000
(Wen Yanshu,)

77
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:00,719
(you'll soon regret tonight's decision.)

78
00:04:04,127 --> 00:04:07,718
(Princess Royal's Mansion)

79
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:16,920
Kneel.

80
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,480
Swallow it.

81
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,360
Take them off.

82
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:13,800
Go on.

83
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,800
Princess Liangyin's ghost husband

84
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:24,000
is indeed handsome,

85
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:25,560
as the rumors say.

86
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,519
An exotic man

87
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:30,079
does have a different charm.

88
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,319
Come.

89
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,720
Undress me.

90
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:37,839
(Wen Yanshu,)

91
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,160
(you killed my parents)

92
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:42,639
(and eliminated my family.)

93
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,720
(I will definitely make you)

94
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,360
(pay with blood.)

95
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,160
(No. I can't move at all.)

96
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,639
(What...)

97
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,920
Kneel.

98
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:05,399
Bring it up.

99
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,720
(Why can't I control my body?)

100
00:06:22,432 --> 00:06:23,264
(Bright and Virtuous)

101
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,199
If it weren't for me,

102
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,759
you would have been buried
with that dead princess.

103
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,079
And now you want to kill me?

104
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:32,600
You are debauched.

105
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,360
Everyone would want to kill you.

106
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:36,360
What I just fed you

107
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:39,079
is poison of the Corpse Bellflower.

108
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,360
Whenever I ring
my Dream-Shattering Bone Chain,

109
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:46,439
you'll have to obey me.

110
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,079
If I die,

111
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:50,639
no one else in this world

112
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,480
can relieve the poison.

113
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,279
Then, it won't be long

114
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:57,639
before the poison spreads
throughout your body.

115
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,879
If you want to kill me,

116
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,480
just do it.

117
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,720
There's no need to bother.

118
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,839
Well,

119
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,199
I like it.

120
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:20,959
(The power of the Evil Bone)

121
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,160
(is the most powerful in the world.)

122
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,480
(Whoever gains this power
will rule the world.)

123
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,279
(To obtain this power,)

124
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:28,480
(one needs to inject)

125
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,720
(Myriad Threads into it and nourish it
with love, hate, and fall)

126
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:33,040
(to make it bloom into)

127
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,279
(the Flower of Three Lives.)

128
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,920
(For some reason,)

129
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,879
(he hates me so much
that he wanted to kill me.)

130
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:42,560
(But it suits my purpose perfectly.)

131
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:44,920
(The flower of hatred
grows from hatred.)

132
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:47,959
(His hatred grants a great opportunity
to nourish this flower.)

133
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,639
Hate me

134
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:51,519
all you want.

135
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:54,480
I like to see you

136
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:57,319
hate me to the bone.

137
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,240
Why don't you show me

138
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,399
how intense your hatred can get?

139
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,319
(All men in the world
are ashamed to be a toyboy.)

140
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:21,959
(If I use this to humiliate him,)

141
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,560
(it'll definitely intensify his hatred.)

142
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,240
I like to tame uncontrollable people.

143
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,279
I will tame you well.

144
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,879
Enjoy it.

145
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:46,200
Come here.

146
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,120
Stay here

147
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:53,960
and make no sound.

148
00:09:13,536 --> 00:09:16,366
(He Chuan, Marquis Cheng'en)

149
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,840
Shu,

150
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,519
I've heard you took
Princess Liangyin's ghost husband.

151
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,480
Brother, you are really well-informed.

152
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,440
You know I don't like
you calling me that.

153
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,279
But we are nominally siblings,

154
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:35,000
and this will never change.

155
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,639
Shu, your scent

156
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,519
is enough to destroy all my willpower.

157
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:49,480
Do you smell it?

158
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,080
What is it?

159
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,080
Did you forget?

160
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,679
This is what we frequently use.

161
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,159
Hypnotic Incense.

162
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,600
What?

163
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,120
Shu,

164
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,759
you have never treated me this way.

165
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,399
Is it because

166
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:18,360
of the person on the bed?

167
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,120
No.

168
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,000
I have my period these days.

169
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:26,000
It's just inconvenient.

170
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,519
Why did it come early?

171
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,480
Do you need an imperial physician?

172
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,120
No need.

173
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,279
A few days of rest will suffice.

174
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:38,519
You should leave now.
In case someone finds out about us.

175
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:43,799
Your Royal Highness, didn't you say

176
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:46,080
you want to tame the uncontrollable?

177
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:46,919
You...

178
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:54,840
Marquis Cheng'en,

179
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,279
you should leave.

180
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,879
Take me to the medicated bath.

181
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:28,360
(Only she can cure
the poison within me.)

182
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:30,639
(So I can't kill her yet.)

183
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,120
(But I can gain her trust first)

184
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:36,480
(to get close and kill that tyrant.)

185
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,759
(To counteract the aphrodisiac incense,
a mere medicated bath is not enough.)

186
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,159
(There is only one way.)

187
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:48,279
(She doesn't seem to want
to have intimate contact with me.)

188
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,159
(No.)

189
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:52,759
(If I can detoxify her today,)

190
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,440
(it would be a perfect opportunity
to gain her trust.)

191
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:59,759
(What I am doing is not what I wish.)

192
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,000
(But compared to the vendetta,)

193
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,919
(it's really not a big deal.)

194
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,840
(The Princess Royal is known
for her ruthlessness.)

195
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,120
(Why did she suddenly
become compassionate today?)

196
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:17,399
Your blood...

197
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:21,639
The less you know,

198
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,360
the longer you live.

199
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:26,120
(Her blood can cause visions.)

200
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,600
(What secret is she hiding?)

201
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:35,360
Your Royal Highness, bad news!

202
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,919
