00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:12,840
You killed him?

4
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,799
He slandered Your Highness.

5
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,560
I just wanted
to teach him a lesson for you.

6
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,079
It turned out to be a mishap.

7
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,760
A mishap?

8
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,400
Don't you believe me?

9
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:36,120
Your Highness.

10
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:37,599
Your Highness,

11
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:39,079
how could you...

12
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,519
He was trusted by His Majesty.

13
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:42,519
Tonight,

14
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:44,359
you didn't see anything.

15
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,439
Your Highness.

16
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,040
Qiya was executed for dishonoring me.

17
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:51,560
And I had a miscarriage due to anger.

18
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,560
Right?

19
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,079
Yes.

20
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:58,000
That's right.

21
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:02,799
Let's go.

22
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,319
For Qiya's death,

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,840
I need a reasonable explanation.

24
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:17,879
If I say it was a mishap,

25
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,319
will you believe me?

26
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,199
The wound on his body

27
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,520
couldn't have been caused by a mishap.

28
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:25,960
He killed my whole family.

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,479
He didn't even spare the children.

30
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:35,400
Your Highness,

31
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,360
will you also feel sad

32
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:39,639
for us lowly people?

33
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,120
So you chose to stay by my side

34
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,240
to find an opportunity for revenge?

35
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:56,039
If you hadn't seized me,

36
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:58,800

you wanted to kill me.

40
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,199
What about now?

41
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:10,719
Is it still the same?

42
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:12,759
If I say yes,

43
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,879

48
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,479

Qiya not only harassed me when drunk,

61
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:59,319
but also pushed me too hard

62
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:00,919
and led to my miscarriage.

63
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,199
Physician Sun can testify.

64
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,080
Father,

65
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,800
that was your unborn grandchild.

66
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,240

67
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,479
is it true?

00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:19,240
Yes.

69
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:25,920
Alright.

70
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:28,040
The rest may leave first.

71
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,399
I want to speak with him alone.

72
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:33,120
Yes.

73
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,199
How exactly did Qiya die?

74
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,439
He was one of the best martial artists

75
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,120
by my side.

76
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,199
To protect Her Highness,

77
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:00,720
I

78
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,800
had to kill him no matter what.

79
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,199
If not for you

80
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,199
making my daughter happy,

81
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,199
I would've killed you long ago.

82
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,439
Remember,

83
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,800
besides making her happy,

84
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,040
you better not have
any other intentions.

85
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,639
Understood.

86
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,160
Your Majesty,

87
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,160
I went to Yeting to get my punishment.

88
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,519
I won't make mistakes again.

89
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:43,199
Lately, your performance

90
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:44,959
has become more and more lax.

91
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,600
Do you

92
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,279
not care
about your sister's life anymore?

93
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:50,720
I wouldn't dare.

94
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:52,560
I will devote myself to Your Majesty.

95
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,639
Come and take a look.

96
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:04,199
(Western Market)
Take a look.

97
00:06:05,716 --> 00:06:06,895
Here you go.

98
00:06:08,096 --> 00:06:10,307
Come and take a look.

99
00:06:12,115 --> 00:06:13,850
Come and have a look.

100
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:19,833
Come and have a look.

101
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,879
Father.

102
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:37,920
Is there any other movement

103
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,079
in Zishang State?

104
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:40,079
Father,

105
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,199
since the former Lord of Zishang
was executed for treason,

106
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:45,279
Si Sheng, the new Lord of Zishang,

107
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,800
has been very obedient.

108
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,920
He voluntarily
handed over military power

109
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,959
and paid double tribute.

110
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,120
Zishang State

111
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:55,199
occupies a strategic point in Linzhao.

112
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,519
We must have total control

113
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,560
of it.

114
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,519
I thought

115
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,399
that given the massacre
of Zishang State,

116
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:02,560
other states

117
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:04,079
dared not stir trouble again.

118
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,560
I didn't expect

119
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,759
that they secretly raised soldiers

120
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,680
and didn't pay tribute

121
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,240
to provoke my anger.

122
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,279
Father,

123
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:12,920
do you need me...

124
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,160
It's hard for our first emperor
to unite the nation.

125
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,360
After all,

126
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,639
our first emperor was a woman.

127
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,920
With the benevolence of a woman,

128
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,759
she allowed

129
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:25,120
the vassal lords

130
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:27,000
to pass down the titles.

131
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:28,920
Off our borders, Xuanhuang

132
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,639
warred against us with all excuses.

133
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,920
Let's solve external problems first,

134
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,480
and then internal ones.

135
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,439
Father,

136
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:38,360
Linzhao is now low

137
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,519
on national wealth,

138
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,279
while Xuanhuang is powerful.

139
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:42,680
I'm afraid the war

140
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,519
won't be in our favor.

141
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,920
Our neighbor Zhuyan

142
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,120
is financially strong.

143
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,839
Linzhao is now in trouble.

144
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,079
And they'll be the next.

145
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,360
All over the country,

146
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,560
everyone is in peril.

147
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,240
I suppose

148
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,399
a negotiation

149
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:02,199
is achievable.

150
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,120
I'm willing to go to Zhuyan

151
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,560
to lobby its emperor.

152
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,959
Good.

153
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,680
You handled the matter

154
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:11,920
of Zishang State well.

155
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,040
Don't

156
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,120
let me down on this task.

157
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:17,839
If you need more manpower,

158
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,360
you can decide on your own.

159
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,639
Set out immediately.

160
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,000
Yes.

161
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:23,959
Wait.

162
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:27,720
When heading to Zhuyan,

163
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:30,319
you must pass through Zishang State

164
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:31,680
to take a look.

165
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,159
If Si Sheng is not fit

166
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,840
to be the lord of a state,

167
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,399
I will strip him of his position.

168
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:39,240
By then,

169
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,720
when we take Zishang back,

170
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:41,840
the people

171
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,840
will be wholeheartedly convinced.

172
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,039
Yes, Your Majesty.

173
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:01,840
Isn't that person Mu Han?

174
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,639
Is something truly going on

175
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,919
between them?

176
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:23,840
I saw you faint in your carriage.

177
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,720
So I had someone
bring you back to my residence.

178
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:29,240
Princess Fuyu, why not cut to the point?

179
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:31,559
Why did you use the hypnotic incense

180
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:33,039
to get me here?

181
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,480
If I am away for too long,

182
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:37,056
the Princess Royal will doubt.

183
00:09:37,491 --> 00:09:38,912
(Princess Royal's Mansion)

184
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,080
Mu Han has gone
to Princess Fuyu's place.

185
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:45,679
Wen Fuyu's place?

186
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:48,000
Alright.

187
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:49,919
I'd like to see

188
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,799
what reason he has.

189
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,399
Then I'll get to the point.

190
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:59,039
I need you

191
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,000
to help me.

192
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,799
My father is old.

193
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,679
When the day that he abdicates comes,

194
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:08,080
it will be the time
to vie for the throne.

195
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,879
So you

196
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,679
want me to help you kill Wen Yanshu?

197
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,360
I want more.

198
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,519
I want her dead

199
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:22,840
and to suffer every possible torment

200
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,000
and die a miserable death.

201
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,879
What Wen Yanshu can do,

202
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:30,240
I can do just as well.

203
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:35,200
I just disdain doing it for others.

204
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,559
What I've always liked

205
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,399
has always been

206
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,000
what Wen Yanshu holds in her hands.

207
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,039
Whatever she loves,

208
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,519
I must take it.

209
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,840
I want her

210
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,039
to suffer endless betrayal
and humiliation

211
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,200
before going mad and dying.

212
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:55,240
Princess Fuyu, aren't you afraid

213
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,120
that I will tell Wen Yanshu all of this?

214
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:00,799
Mu Han,

215
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,200
I reckon you're a smart person.

216
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,679
You should know how to choose.

217
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,840
Even if you chose Wen Yanshu,

218
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:12,080
to me, you are just another

219
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,679
insignificant life

220
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:15,799
that I will have to take.

221
00:11:16,212 --> 00:11:19,232
(Princess Royal's Mansion)

222
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:28,840
What color do you think this is?

223
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,639
Stop swaying.

224
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Why are you wandering in front of me?

225
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,039
It's so obvious.

226
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:40,480
You still can't see it?

227
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:43,360
Y-You must have bad eyesight.

228
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,799
I'm in a bad mood now.

229
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:45,440
I want to kill.

230
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,840
You'd better stay away from me.

231
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,759
You ignorant one!

232
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:50,000
You were cheated on, you know?

233
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,039
So noisy.

234
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,519
Zi Mo, get the carriage.

235
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,799
I wanted to tip her off.

236
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,279
She thought I was ill-intended.

237
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,360
Unbelievable.

238
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,759
How could she miss it?

239
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,759
Think carefully

240
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,519
about what I told you.

241
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,960
What's with all the fuss?

242
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,080
What happened?

243
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:28,200
My dog is lost.

244
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,519
I come to look for it.
