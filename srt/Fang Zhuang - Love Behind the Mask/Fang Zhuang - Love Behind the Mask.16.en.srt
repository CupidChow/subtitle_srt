00:00:39,712 --> 00:00:41,248
=Episode 16=

3
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:42,960
Mind your own business.

4
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,552
Brother!

5
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,880
Let me do it.

6
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,159
My lord,

7
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:32,359
he's dead.

8
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,200
Sorry.

9
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,319
I just wanted

10
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:38,959
to torture him a bit.

11
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,239
I didn't expect him to die so quickly.

12
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:45,319
Then throw him into the mass grave

13
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,040
and bury him.

14
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,599
General,

15
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:16,759
we haven't found Bai Ling's body.

16
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,319
You may leave.

17
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:32,120
Your Majesty.

18
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,199
Please spare me.

19
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,039
Please spare me.

20
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:52,840
Please spare me.

21
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,800
Your Majesty...

22
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,520
Maybe the blood spirit

23
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:06,120
can only be continued
by Shu's bloodline.

24
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,439
Your Majesty,

25
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:25,719
is it bad news from the border?

26
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,080
To avenge his son,

27
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,800
King of Xuanhuang

28
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:31,319
deployed all his forces.

29
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:33,360
Our border

30
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:34,840
has already fallen.

31
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:37,400
Forgive my bluntness.

32
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,680
If we agree to the marriage alliance,

33
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,560
Zhuyan will definitely
send reinforcements immediately.

34
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,919
Shu cannot marry far away.

35
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,879
But the Crown Prince of Zhuyan
specifically requested her.

36
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,840
She can't be replaced.

37
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:51,680
Your Majesty,

38
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,080
Zhuyan's Crown Prince's letter.

39
00:03:55,968 --> 00:03:56,599
(Yan Shi'an)

40
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:58,840
(If Your Majesty doesn't marry
the Princess Royal to me,)

41
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:00,400
(we)

42
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,039
(will then fully support Xuanhuang.)

43
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:06,319
Please calm your anger.

44
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,840
Did the Crown Prince of Zhuyan

45
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,520
say something in the letter?

46
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,639
The top priority now

47
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,400
is to quickly arrange

48
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,639
Shu's dowry.

49
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,720
Once she marries into Zhuyan

50
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,600
and gets pregnant,

51
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:19,319
there will be ways

52
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:20,360
to summon her back.

53
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,879
Yes, Your Majesty.

54
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:28,639
Father

55
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:31,160
won't have me marry away
in place of Wen Yanshu, will he?

56
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:32,959
I'm afraid that's his intention.

57
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:37,319
Don't worry.

58
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:40,160
I will finalize your marriage soon.

59
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:41,480
Okay.

60
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,879
Fuyu,

61
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,160
do you have someone you like?

62
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,399
Of course, I do.

63
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,879
I've already had someone in my mind.

64
00:05:01,472 --> 00:05:04,352
(Taiji Hall)

65
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,680
I've drafted the decree

66
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,360
for the marriage alliance.

67
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,759
Father!

68
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,160
Hurry up and accept the decree.

69
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:21,199
The Crown Prince of Zhuyan
is very fond of you.

70
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,199
You will grow old together in happiness.

71
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,839
Your Majesty,

72
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:29,959
since Shu's marriage has been settled,

73
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,000
why not finalize Fuyu's marriage
as well?

74
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,192
Okay.

75
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:38,519
Fuyu.

76
00:05:48,896 --> 00:05:51,936
♪Holding tightly to the obsession♪

77
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:53,519
General Mu

78
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,800
is a young talent.

79
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,800
Fuyu has long admired him.

80
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,439
It's truly a match made in heaven

81
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,319
and another delightful event.

82
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:03,759
Mu Han,

83
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:05,680
are you willing to marry me?

84
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:12,079
Wen Yanshu will leave
for the marriage alliance

85
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,519
and never return.

86
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,279
If you are willing to marry me,

87
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:18,079
you will not only be a general.

88
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:19,839
But in the future,

89
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,079
I'll get you to a position

90
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,519
below none but one.

91
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,199
At that time,

92
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:26,680
if you want the throne...

93
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,040
I'm not getting married.

94
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,720
Shu.

95
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:50,720
Everyone, leave.

96
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:52,600
Leave.

97
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,959
Shu,

98
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:16,399
do you remember

99
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,920
the consequence of defying me

100
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,160
last time?

101
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,120
Father, please calm down.

102
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,160
I'm just sad about the thought

103
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:25,279
of leaving you

104
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,560
and my country.

105
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:27,439
That's why...

106
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:28,240
Your marriage

107
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:29,839
is settled.

108
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:39,360
(If I refuse,)

109
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,360
(the people of Linzhao
will be plunged into misery.)

110
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:44,199
(If I accept it,)

111
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:45,879
(the worst result)

112
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,759
(is to tell Shi'an the truth,)

113
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,920
(and I'll still have a way out.)

114
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:54,360
I accept it.

115
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,279
It's just that I want

116
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,759
to choose the entourage for myself.

117
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,160
I know

118
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,839
your little schemes.

119
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:09,680
Shu,

120
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,360
don't overdo it.

121
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:14,439
I understand.

122
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,752
(Princess Royal's Mansion)

123
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:23,680
Is Shu going to marry for alliance?

124
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,480
Why are you so angry?

125
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,079
Have a cup of tea

126
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,080
and calm down.

127
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:39,559
In 24 hours,

128
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,879
I'm sending her to marry for alliance.

129
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,879
Aren't you preparing anything?

130
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,720
Do you believe

131
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,960
I will kill you right now?

132
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,240
Even if you kill me,

133
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:54,360
it will not change the fact
of the marriage alliance.

134
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:02,679
Her Royal Highness is helpless now.

135
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:04,679
The only one who can save her

136
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:08,759
is you.

137
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,799
Do you think I don't know

138
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:17,639
this is the trap you set,

139
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:20,159
waiting for me
to step into it obediently?

140
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,519
She has been kind to me.

141
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,039
I don't want her to live in misery

142
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,240
in a foreign land.

143
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,360
If you are willing to save her,

144
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,360
I can pretend not to see anything.

145
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,559
Why do you think

146
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:38,320
I will believe what you say?

147
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:40,279
Do you have another choice?

148
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:44,600
Will you watch the person
you care about the most

149
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,360
marry someone else far away

150
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,960
and have children

151
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,000
so that you will never

152
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,519
see her again?

153
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,639
Think about it.

154
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:00,896
My lord,

155
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,799
are you really snatching the bride?

156
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:05,080
This mission is very important.

157
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:08,279
Be sure to find a few skilled people

158
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:10,080
and act cautiously

159
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,960
so as to alert no one.

160
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:12,879
Understood.
