3
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:12,480
Outside Yeting,

4
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,000
why is there a sky lantern lit up?

5
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,719
Hurry and inform my mother.

6
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:17,280
Yes.

7
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:35,760
Since we can't find a replacement

8
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,439
for Shu among the commoners,

9
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:39,959
let her

10
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,359
be the sacrifice tonight.

11
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,359
Spare me.

12
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:46,120
After Shu

13
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:47,480
gives birth to a child,

14
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:50,159
we only need to find a way

15
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:51,840
to get her child back.

16
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,280
The blood spirit's energy

17
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,519
will prosper again then.

18
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,719
Please spare me.

19
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,120
Please spare me.

20
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:01,359
Please spare me.

21
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:02,760
Silence her.

22
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,519
Please spare me.

23
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,520
Your Majesty.

24
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,520
Did you make these?

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yes,

26
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:52,000
Your Majesty.

27
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,599
Please forgive me.

28
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,639
I made these to pray for bliss for Xuan.

29
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:58,719
For bliss?

30
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:02,240
You want His Majesty
to find out about your existence

31
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,240
and get both you and your son

32
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,639
out of this place, don't you?

33
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,800
I wouldn't dare.

34
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,960
I know my mistake.

35
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,840
Your Majesty and Your Highness,

36
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:12,039
please spare me and my son.

38
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:23,479
Collection of Governance Essentials?

39
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,439
And you even took notes.

40
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,159
That's not bad.

(Collection of Governance Essentials)

42
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,039
Since you are already old enough,

43
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,319
follow your mother

44
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,199
and do more labor in Yeting.

45
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,360
Don't study these things

46
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:49,199
so as not to generate thoughts

47
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,719
that you shouldn't have.

48
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:53,240
Xuan and I
will discipline ourselves strictly,

49
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,080
stay deep in Yeting,

50
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,919
and never step out of it.

51
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,960
Please rest assured, Your Majesty.

52
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:00,680
If I ever make another mistake,

53
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:02,800
Your Majesty may as well execute me.

You will know someday.

76
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:58,040
Wen Yanshu saved me.

77
00:05:58,519 --> 00:05:59,439
These days,

78
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,040
I'd been healing in a suburban house.

79
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,279
When I healed,

80
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:03,519
I came out to find you

81
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,160
only to find you

82
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,680
sent her away

83
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,959
for a marriage alliance.

84
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,680
I didn't expect her to be soft-hearted.

85
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:14,639
Young Master,

86
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,720
in the suburban house, I saw

87
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,079
your family's former maiden,

88
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:18,959
Wang Qing.

89
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:23,959
Back then, the emperor ordered

90
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,240
a thorough massacre

91
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,439
of the late lord's mansion.

92
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,959
I was stabbed several times.

93
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:30,000
If the Princess Royal hadn't saved me,

94
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:31,399
I would have died long ago.

95
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,920
She was not part of that massacre.

96
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,232
She was

97
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,040
just used as a pawn.

98
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:39,279
She wasn't part of it?

99
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:40,439
Yes.

100
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,959
I dare not deceive you.

101
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,319
Her Highness's wedding in Zhuyan

102
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:46,480
is some time away.

103
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,199
If we go to Zhuyan now,

104
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,120
we'll make it.

105
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,160
Even if I take her away, then what?

106
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,439
Hundreds of lives in my clan perished.

107
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,360
I haven't avenged them.

108
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:01,000
Why should I drag her into this abyss?

109
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,160
He Chuan, Marquis Cheng'en,

110
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,360
intended to ruin the marriage alliance.

111
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:11,120
His intentions were sinister.

112
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,399
He's demoted to a commoner

113
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,759
and forever banned from the palace.

114
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,639
Do you know
how much pain she was in back then?

115
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,040
And you're scared now?

116
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:37,439
She feared pain so much.

117
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,560
You not only killed her

118
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,439
but also disfigured her.

119
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,519
I want you to pay for everything.

120
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:45,839
Shi'an!

121
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:52,000
Stop.

122
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,240
What did you call me?

123
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,120
A hibiscus tattoo on the forehead

124
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,279
indicates deep affection.

125
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:06,000
Four seasons cycle

126
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:09,680
without changing the face from the past.

127
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:14,519
Shi'an,

128
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,879
I am Anning.

129
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,639
Anning?

130
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,360
I am Anning.

(Virtue and Fame Remain)

134
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,200
On the day of my family's destruction,

135
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:56,080
I swore

136
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:58,159
to capture my enemies

137
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,519
one by one alive

138
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:01,039
and make them pay with blood.

139
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,840
Now

140
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,639
it's your turn.

141
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:06,720
You survived.

142
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:08,559
No wonder

143
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:11,639
you forced Shu into a marriage alliance

144
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,440
and demoted me to a commoner.

145
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,000
This is all your scheme.

146
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,320
Had I known this,
I should have killed you

147
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:23,559
back then
in the Lord of Zishang's Mansion.

148
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:25,759
But you missed that chance long ago.

149
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,960
Kneel and repent to them.

150
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,240
Kneel?

151
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,159
I won't.

152
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:36,000
If you don't kneel,

153
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:37,840
next time

154
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,000
I will cut off your legs.

155
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:47,879
You want me to kneel to them?

156
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,399
You can dream on!

157
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:52,679
A man of treason

158
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,399
deserves to be killed by all.

159
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:55,960
Your family deserves to die.

160
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,279
Treason?

161
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,919
My father ruled Zishang State
for so many years

162
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,840
with loyalty.

163
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:07,480
And he was accused of treason.

164
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,720
It is you people who should die.

165
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:11,320
He deserved death!

166
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:16,080
Because of my mother's low status,

167
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:17,919
he refused to acknowledge me.

168
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:20,080
He moved us to the side courtyard

169
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:22,159
to be bullied by all.

170
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:35,720
Look at what I have.

171
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,960
Let me play with it.

172
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:39,159
Watch out!

173
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,360
Were you blind?

174
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:47,968
Brother,

175
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,039
here.

176
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:50,840
Thank you for saving me.

177
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:53,000
I'll bring you one every day

178
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:54,120
and play with you again.

179
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:01,519
It's you.

180
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,240
My mother merely
did something wrong back then,

181
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,200
and your heartless father

182
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,120
expelled my mother and me

183
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:13,759
from the mansion

184
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:16,600
and ultimately caused my mother's death.

185
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:18,440
Therefore,

186
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,159
I secretly swore

187
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,080
that one day,

188
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,759
I would flatten that disgusting place

189
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:29,679
and kill that heartless man.

190
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:31,679
By the way,

191
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,440
do you know

192
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:36,480
I plotted the treason charge

193
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:39,399
