00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:42,600
Does love

4
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,479
have to be exclusive?

5
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,560
Besides, our relationship...

6
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,119
So what?

7
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,600
You and I both know the truth.

8
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,399
If you mind the relationship,

9
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:03,479
I will take you to a place
where there is no one else

10
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,879
and accompany you

11
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,680
through the short lifetime left.

12
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,439
Marquis,

13
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:17,079
this kind of thing

14
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:19,400
is better if both parties are in love.

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,640
We were in love in the past.

16
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:25,879
You know that was the past.

17
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,519
Now the person with Shu

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,799
is me.

19
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:33,400
Let's go, Shu.

20
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:45,959
My lord,

21
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,760
should I teach that man a lesson?

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,079
I want

23
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,480
Mu Han dead tonight.

24
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:54,840
Go.

25
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,560
Bring Si Sheng here.

26
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:58,519
Yes.

27
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,759
What's wrong?

28
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:14,680
What do you mean?

29
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:16,719
You seem

30
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,639

Guard Mu serves the Princess Royal.

102
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,560
Do you

00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,120
know him?

106
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,680
It's just that he looks a bit familiar.

107
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:58,560
Perhaps

108
00:05:58,879 --> 00:05:59,560
I mistook.

109
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:00,879
You mistook?

110
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:02,600
Those who don't know

111
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:04,040
might think you were

112
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,240
going to compete with me for a man.

113
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,639
You must be joking.

114
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:10,759
Encounter

115
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:11,800
beats invitation.

116
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,639
You must be tired from your journey.

117
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,480
How about

118
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,040
staying in Zishang for a few days

119
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,199
and letting me host you?

120
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,040
Just accept this as an apology

121
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,040
for my rudeness.

122
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:25,319
We appreciate that.

123
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,439
Everyone,

124
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,360
please.

please.

128
00:06:58,079 --> 00:06:58,879
He resembles.

129
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:01,079
He resembles that person a lot.

130
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,399
Could it be that

131
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,759
that person's death
back then was a fake?

132
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,560
Who was sent to assassinate

133
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,800
Si Yichen back then?

134
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,199
It was Zhu Yu.

135
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,600
He failed the task

136
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:12,480
and was exiled

137
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,319
to a farmstead on the suburb.

138
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:15,720
Quickly.

139
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,519
Send someone to fetch him.

140
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,279
Understood.

141
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,480
(Open and Above Board)
What is so urgent

142
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,120
that you had to invite me

143
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,000
and Guard Mu over so early?

144
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:38,240
Your Highness,
I need to tell you something.

145
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,480
Yesterday,

146
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,439
when I

147
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,000
saw Guard Mu,

148
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,720
I found him very familiar.

149
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:44,959
He resembles

150
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,279
the late Lord of Zishang.

151
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,720
Guard Mu,

152
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:57,079
what relation do you have

153
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,519
to him?

154
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,959
What do you mean?

155
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:01,959
Back then,

156
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,120
my unworthy brother

157
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,439
harbored treasonous intentions.

158
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,480
His Majesty ordered him to be executed.

159
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,959
His, his wife's, and my nephew,

160
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:12,079
Si Yichen's bodies
were hung at the city gate

161
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:13,120
as a warning to others.

162
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:14,519
But

163
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,480
my nephew had suffered
from madness since childhood

164
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,120
and been recuperating
in the deep mountains.

165
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,360
People

166
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:23,759
do not know
what he looked like grown up.

167
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,399
When I

168
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,720
saw Guard Mu,

169
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,199
I wondered

170
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,600
whether the body that was hanged

171
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,720
on the city gate back then
was my nephew,

172
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,120
Si Yichen.

173
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,639
You said I am Si Yichen?

174
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,720
Many people in the world look alike.

175
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:02,720
You have no founded proof.

176
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,679
You should speak more cautiously.

177
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,799
My lord,

178
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:09,039
what do you think?

179
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:16,480
Tell us.

180
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:18,759
Who are you exactly?

181
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,799
If you are Si Yichen,

182
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,360
then who was the body

183
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,320
of Si Yichen we hung on the city gate

184
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,600
back then?

185
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,679
And why did you

186
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,759
approach Shu?

187
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,320
You won't say?

188
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,120
Then I will

189
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:46,960
kill you now.

190
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,600
Stop.

191
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:56,480
You do favor Guard Mu a lot.

192
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,559
You even shielded him from a blade.

193
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,799
Wen Yanshu

194
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
is quite protective.

195
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:04,080
Shu,

196
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,480
he has an unknown origin.

197
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,759
Keeping him

198
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:08,360
will bring a disaster.

199
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,120
You said he is Si Yichen.

200
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,120
What evidence do you have?

201
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:17,159
Zhu Yu,

202
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,200
come in.

203
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,639
Greetings, my lord.

204
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,000
Greetings, everyone.

205
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,919
Zhu Yu,

206
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:25,320
take a good look.

207
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:26,799
Is he

208
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,879
Si Yichen or not?

209
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,120
You and Anning are about to marry.

210
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,360
Separated for a decade,

211
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,080
she probably won't recognize you.

212
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,120
Young Master,

213
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,679
your father sent me to escort you

214
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:46,000
to marry Miss Anning.

215
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,399
It seems someone is impatient.

216
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,519
It's not safe now.

217
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,399
I'll personally escort Yichen back
to his parents.

218
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,480
Bai Ling,

219
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:04,639
you go pick up Anning.

220
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:05,759
Tell her I'll wait

221
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:06,840
for her at Yichen's home.

222
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:07,639
Understood.

223
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:19,240
My lord,

224
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,720
I have looked at him carefully.

225
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,360
He

226
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,039
is indeed not Si Yichen.

227
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:30,639
Did you look carefully?

228
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:32,399
My lord,

229
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:34,519
I have looked at him very carefully.

230
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,559
His visage

231
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,879
somehow resembles Si Yichen's.

232
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,039
But he's definitely not him.

233
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,159
Lord of Zishang,

234
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,360
you embarrassed my guard once and again.

235
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,320
Do you hold a grudge against me?

236
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:54,440
I was confused.

237
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:56,159
Please forgive me.

238
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:58,679
Okay.

239
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:01,320
You want to settle it

240
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,960
with just "confused"?

241
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,799
Yanshu,

242
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,039
be lenient where leniency is due.

243
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:11,440
Lord of Zishang didn't mean it.

244
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,200
Why must you be so aggressive?

245
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:15,440
Fuyu,

246
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:17,159
why are you speaking for him

247
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,759
instead of defending our own people?

248
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:20,799
I just feel

249
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,720
the lord

250
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,960
merely cared about Yanshu's safety.

251
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:25,440
Besides,

252
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,320
mistaking someone

253
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,759
is not a big deal.

254
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,600
You're so magnanimous.

255
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,200
How about

256
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:34,720
you apologize for Lord of Zishang?

257
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:35,440
You...!

258
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,600
Shu,

259
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,200
take a step back.

260
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:39,879
Since the matter is settled,

261
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:41,080
let's drop it.

262
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:44,200
Are you really going to
make the lord apologize

263
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,960
to a mere unknown guard?

264
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:48,960
What happened today

265
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,159
is my fault.

266
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:51,559
I was blind.

267
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,360
I shouldn't have offended you

268
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,440
and Guard Mu.

269
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:56,200
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

270
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,440
I'll let go of what happened today.

271
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,120
If there is a next time,

272
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,080
I will not tolerate it again.

273
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,279
Thank you for your grace.

274
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:09,559
Let's go.

275
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,360
My lord,

276
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,639
I still feel

277
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,000
he looks like the late

278
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:22,879
Lord of Zishang.

279
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:24,840
Go investigate him.

280
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,120
Okay.

281
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:39,360
Tell me.

282
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:41,559
