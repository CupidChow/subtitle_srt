Yanshu,

00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:55,920
I'm here to check

00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,079

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,880
Please don't take offense.

00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:02,240
No need.

11
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,799
Without my permission,

12
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:06,120
he can forget about leaving my sight.

13
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:10,920
Yanshu, aren't you

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,319
too overbearing like this?

15
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,239

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,640
Is the person in your heart

00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,719
Mu Han?

18
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,400
You may guess.

19
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:58,120
The answer is all over your face.

20
00:01:58,799 --> 00:01:59,680
In my opinion,

21
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,200
you should be bold,

22
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,200
pin him onto the bed,

23
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:04,280

24
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,719
"Do you like me?"

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,479
What if he says

26
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,039
he doesn't?

27
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,520
It's not up to him.

28
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,800
Just tie him up.

29
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:16,400
Truss him up.

30
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,199
Tie him up.

31
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:17,800

is Mu Han.

192
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:06,159
Both of you

193
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:09,320
are remnants of Zishang.

194
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,080
Aren't you?

195
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:19,360
You won't tell?

196
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:25,039
Then I'll wait for Mu Han to come.

197
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,000
And you two can die together.

198
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,120
Keep an eye on him.

199
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:35,879
No mishaps are allowed.

200
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,080
Understood.

201
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:53,759
Your Highness,
my brother acted on his own

202
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:55,080
to deliver a message to Xuanwu

203
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,399
and hasn't returned yet.

204
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:58,799
Not even his body has been found.

205
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:04,256
(To save Bai Ling, come to the dungeon
before dusk tomorrow.)

206
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:09,240
Bai Ling was captured by He Chuan.

207
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,480
Bring me my sword.

208
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:13,799
Your Highness,

209
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:14,519
you can't go.

210
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,039
This is clearly a trap.

211
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,519
It's all because of my indecision

212
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:20,039
that Bai Ling is now in peril.

213
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,120
I can't let him
bear all the consequences for me.

214
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:32,224
My lord.

215
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,088
Princess Royal.

216
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,440
Did you take me here at night

217
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,639
to watch you torture a prisoner?

218
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,240
Do you know

219
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:45,840
the General Mu that you care for

220
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,159
is plotting

221
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,200
together with him?

222
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,440
What does that have to do with me?

223
00:11:58,039 --> 00:11:59,240
You'll find out soon.

224
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,519
Speak.

225
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:07,759
Who are you exactly?

226
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:09,000
Who are you?

227
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:10,176
Speak.

228
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,072
Speak.

229
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,720
Speak now.

230
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,279
Marquis Cheng'en,

231
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:26,919
why do you want me here?

232
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,559
General Mu.

233
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:37,600
Do you know who he is?

234
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,200
I don't know him.

235
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:42,440
You don't?

236
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:45,320
Alright.

237
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,720
Your actions

238
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,200
are so cruel.

239
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:50,960
Don't you fear retribution?

240
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,480
Mind your own business.

241
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,039
