00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,216
=Episode 4=

3
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,840
Who are you?

4
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,159
I am the Princess Royal.

5
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,719
You dare to attack me? Who sent you?

6
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:57,759
Princess Royal?

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,439
Everyone will see your disgrace now.

8
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,000
You!

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,479
Princess!

10
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,039
Since the audience is here,

11
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:04,879
show us something special.

12
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:22,799
Mu Han?

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,719
Princess.

14
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:25,959
Hold on to me.

15
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:27,680
Don't let go.

16
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:31,200
(He clearly hates me to the bone.)

17
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:33,519
(Why would he risk his life to save me?)

18
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,000
Princess.

19
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:50,319
Are you okay?

20
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,079
Take your filthy hands off her.

21
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,319
Don't hold her.

22
00:01:59,319 --> 00:01:59,840
Why?

23
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,400
Am I

24
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:03,640
not worthy?

25
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,879
Mu Han.

26
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:25,520
Mu Han?

27
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:26,919
Yes, Your Highness.

28
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:30,000
(Win a ghost husband over
in just a few days?)

29
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:31,280
(Wen Yanshu,)

30
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,080
(you are truly not simple.)

31
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,520
Come here, my dear.

32
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,759
Did you get hurt?

33
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,879
I'm fine, Father.

34
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,520
That's good.

35
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:41,919
Your Majesty.

36
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:43,159
Have you found out

37
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,199
the mastermind?

38
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,520
It's Princess Jiyao.

39
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:47,159
Shall I...

40
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:48,439
I took her sister's man.

41
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,599
She is resentful,

42
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,800
so she resorted to such foolish actions.

43
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:52,919
Never mind.

44
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,520
I don't bother to argue with her.

45
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,520
You're so broad-minded,

46
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:59,400
Princess Royal.

47
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,560
I shall take my leave.

48
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,240
I shall take my leave.

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,039
My daughter

50
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,000
has grown up.

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,840
By the way, Father,

52
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,280
do you still remember

53
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,639
the slave Mu Han you granted me?

54
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:16,280
He is very skilled.

55
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,240
Without him,

56
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,400
I wouldn't have escaped.

57
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,039
Could you please

58
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,240
remove his slave status

59
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,120
and name him my armed guard?

60
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:24,719
Well...

61
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,360
Father,

62
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,240
with Zi Mo

63
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,560
and Mu Han by my side,

64
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:32,120
I will not be afraid

65
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,000
of any danger.

66
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:34,199
Alright.

67
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,599
All as you wish.

68
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,599
Thank you, Father.

69
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,832
(Princess Royal's Mansion)

70
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,400
Shu.

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,560
You're becoming more and more audacious

72
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,639
before me.

73
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,400
What do you want

74
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,400
to do today, Shu?

75
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,520
Let me see your wound.

76
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,319
Is it getting better?

77
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,479
With the nourishment of your blood,

78
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,240
it will heal soon.

79
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,600
(Myriad Threads can cure all diseases.)

80
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,959
Now that they've entered your body,

81
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,160
your blood

82
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:26,319
has gained healing powers.

83
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:27,000
(No one)

84
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,519
(can know about it.)

85
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,160
That's good.

86
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,480
Let me see.

87
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,879
This slave mark

88
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,240
looks ugly.

89
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:41,879
I don't like it.

90
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:45,639
Bite it.

91
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,560
From now on,

92
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:42,639
you are no longer my slave.

93
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,839
You are

94
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:46,439
my bodyguard.

95
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:51,160
Thank you.

96
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,399
Wishing Your Majesty a long life

97
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,800
and great health.

98
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,399
Wishing Your Majesty a long life
and great health.

99
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,399
Just a family banquet.

100
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,720
So no formalities.

101
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:31,319
Father,

102
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:35,279
this is a landscape embroidery
I personally made.

103
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:37,160
What beautiful embroidery!

104
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,439
Your Majesty,

105
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,360
Fuyu is so considerate.

106
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,120
Shu,

107
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,879
what gift

108
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:48,199
have you prepared?

109
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:56,079
Your Majesty,

110
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,040
Princess Royal
really values your birthday.

111
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,480
Several months ago,

112
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,199
she had me prepare the gift.

113
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,279
Your Majesty,

114
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:09,959
this is a human skin drum.

115
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,879
It is made from the corpse of the rebel

116
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:13,519
Hang Zhan of Zishang State.

117
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,560
It shall bless our army

118
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,040
with victory

119
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,720
in every battle.

120
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:39,360
A human skin drum?

121
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,600
That sounds interesting.

122
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:43,279
How is it made?

123
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,360
The drum is made

124
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,279
from the softest part of human skin,

125
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,639
peeled and filled with mercury.

126
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,879
The joints are used for its framework

127
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,839
with tendons wrapped around its end.

128
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:55,360
After being dried,

129
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:56,680
this

130
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:58,600
exquisite

131
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,279
human skin drum is completed.

132
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,279
Good.

133
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,959
Now

134
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:06,600
that the vassal lords

135
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:07,759
have grown restless,

136
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,120
this human skin drum

137
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,000
will serve as a warning.

138
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,279
If anyone dares

139
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,399
to follow in the foolish steps
of the Lord of Zishang,

140
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,160
this drum

141
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:18,560
will be his fate.

142
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:23,959
Wishing Father

143
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,000
longevity

144
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,279
and good health.

145
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:31,040
Great.

146
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,720
Shu,

147
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:39,159
you truly understand me.

148
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,720
I shall take my leave.

149
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:29,159
(Wait a little longer.)

150
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:32,519
(Once I gain Wen Yanshu's trust)

151
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:34,000
(and get close to the tyrant,)

152
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,519
(I'll kill him personally)

153
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:38,399
(and take my revenge.)

154
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:51,600
Let's go home.

155
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,759
Stop there!

156
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:56,759
Let her go!

157
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,840
No need.

158
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:00,519
I just called you Brother,

159
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,559
and now you obey my every word.

160
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,159
But you are

161
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,120
just a plaything for me.

162
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,200
Plaything?

163
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,360
Shu.

164
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,320
I do not care at all.

165
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,759
There are eyes in the palace.

166
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,799
It's not proper for you

167
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,240
to be like this.

168
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:20,759
Shut up!

169
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:22,480
You, a lowly slave,

170
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,919
dare to speak against me?

171
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:25,519
Don't you know everything
that's going on

172
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:27,080
in the Princess Royal's Mansion?

173
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,200
How come you don't know

174
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,120
she has already made me

175
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,879
her personal

176
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,360
bodyguard?

177
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:41,000
Take me back.

178
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:42,240
Okay.

179
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,639
Let's go home.

180
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:50,480
(Shu,)

181
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,559
