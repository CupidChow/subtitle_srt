=Episode 6=

3
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:57,439
Lowly slave!

4
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:58,920
How dare you!

5
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,560
Open the door!

6
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:03,600
Is it fun to do so?

7
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,200
Of course.

8
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,239
Otherwise,

9
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,159
you would not be enjoying it.

10
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:21,359
Marquis.

11
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:24,040
Go fetch the forged bell.

12
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,120
Yes.

13
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:29,639
Greetings, Your Majesty.

14
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,560
The mastermind of Princess's kidnapping

15
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,120
is Princess Jiyao.

16
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:35,840
Mu Han risked his life

17
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,840
to save her.

18
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:37,919
Therefore,

19
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:39,960
she has been very fond of him recently.

20
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,280
Is Shu

21
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,719
pregnant?

22
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,280
There are no signs yet.

23
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:49,520
Your Majesty,

24
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,840
Marquis Cheng'en is here.

25
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:54,840
Let him in.

26
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:55,319
Yes.

27
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,840
Summon Marquis Cheng'en.

28
00:03:04,192 --> 00:03:05,080
Greetings, Father.

29
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:06,039
Cheng'en.

30
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,000
Father,

31
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,120
last night, Princess Jiyao was abducted.

32
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,520
Today,

33
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:11,879
when I searched the room,

34
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,120
I found this.

35
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:15,520
A bell?

36
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,599
I remember

37
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,680
it belongs to a toyboy of Shu.

38
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,719
You mean,

39
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,840
he is the one

40
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,039
who kidnapped Jiyao?

41
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,560
Right.

42
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:45,520
Father, please look.

43
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,520
His name

44
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:49,000
is engraved on it.

45
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,840
Mu Han?

46
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:56,520
Dare to kidnap the princess.

47
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,439
He truly disregards the royal.

48
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,960
What's more,

49
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,840
this man

50
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,719
must have ulterior motives

51
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,360
towards Princess Royal.

52
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,319
Please allow me

53
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,400
to lead the troops

54
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:10,759
investigating him

55
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,199
and bring him

56
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,280
to justice.

57
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,280
Qiya.

58
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:16,920
Go together

59
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,040
with Cheng'en.

60
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,720
Yes.

61
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:20,319
Thank you, Father.

62
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,839
Guards! Escort Princess Jiyao back.

63
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,120
- Summon the imperial physician.
- Yes.

64
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:36,192
(Princess Royal's Mansion)

65
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,000
- Seize him!
- Yes!

66
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,240
Marquis Cheng'en,

67
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,839
what do you mean?

68
00:04:52,096 --> 00:04:54,800
You abducted the princess last night.
You shall be punished.

69
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,480
His Majesty orders

70
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,360
you to be imprisoned in the dungeon

71
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,920
and executed.

72
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,600
Last night?

73
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:06,720
Her Highness and I

74
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,360
slept together on the same bed

75
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,680
the entire night.

76
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,000
I suppose

77
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:14,920
you are fully aware of this.

78
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:15,879
You...

79
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:17,800
How dare you!

80
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,680
How dare you

81
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:21,480
slander Her Highness?

82
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,079
To charge me,

83
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:25,519
show me the evidence.

84
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,959
Princess Jiyao was imprisoned by you,

85
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,399
unconscious for a long time

86
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,000
and on the verge of death.

87
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:34,759
Your Harmonious Bell

88
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:36,759
was found in her room.

89
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,319
The evidence is irrefutable.

90
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,079
Any questions?

91
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,839
Forging evidence

92
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,959
to frame me.

93
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,319
Your tactics

94
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,920
are filthy.

95
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,399
I just want to slander you

96
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,000
and take your life.

97
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,199
What can you do?

98
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,839
Before striking a dog,
one must consider its master.

99
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,959
Did you ask for my permission

100
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,040
before laying a hand on him?

101
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,040
Your Highness.

102
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,240
Your Highness,

103
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,480
he kidnapped Princess Jiyao.

104
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,848
The evidence is conclusive.

105
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,959
We are merely carrying out orders.

106
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:34,199
If any offense,

107
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,240
please forgive us.

108
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,600
Shu.

109
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,399
Shu.

110
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:43,040
You wouldn't disobey His Majesty

111
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,399
just for a guard,

112
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,279
right?

113
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:51,319
What if I insist on protecting him?

114
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:55,839
Shu.

115
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,759
Defying the decree

116
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,199
is a serious crime.

117
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,279
Your Highness, please cooperate.

118
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:04,319
His Majesty

119
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,959
is very concerned

120
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,279
about Princess Jiyao's safety.

121
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:09,199
Would you really risk

122
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,000
straining your relationship

123
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,319
over a guard?

124
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:14,680
He's not worthy.

125
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:16,959
Just a guard.

126
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:18,920
If you want him,

127
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,959
take him away.

128
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,800
Did you hear it?

129
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,560
Just a guard.

130
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:34,079
Take him away.

131
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:34,639
Yes.

132
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:44,160
Put away your dirty gaze.

133
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,040
In this world,

134
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:47,959
no one

135
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,160
can take Shu away from me.

136
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,519
Take him away!

137
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:54,920
Shu!

138
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,240
Enjoy this night.

139
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:41,679
Tomorrow,

140
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,440
no one will remember you anymore.

141
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:46,399
You are afraid.

142
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,000
You fear Her Highness will fall for me,

143
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:52,080
so you want to kill me.

144
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,240
I fear you?

145
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,120
You are just a cheap toy.

146
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,240
Shu will not love you.

147
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,879
I just fear you'll

148
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:03,399
dirty Shu's mansion.

149
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,480
I'm cleaning up for her.

150
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,919
I heard you're skilled at killing,

151
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,000
cutting off their flesh piece by piece

152
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,159
with

153
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,080
exactly one thousand cuts

154
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,480
before they die.

155
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:24,519
Yes.

156
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:25,879
Marquis,

157
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:27,399
as long as you give the order,

158
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:28,840
I make sure

159
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:31,240
he won't die easily.

160
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,399
Take good care of him.

161
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:36,039
He must not die easily.

162
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:36,519
Yes.

163
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:43,679
Boy,

164
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,840
blame your unlucky fate

165
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,639
for offending Marquis Cheng'en.

166
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:50,879
The night is long.

167
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:53,679
I will let you die slowly.
