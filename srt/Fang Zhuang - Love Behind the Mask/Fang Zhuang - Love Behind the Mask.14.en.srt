87
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:22,199

101
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,199
This is...

102
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:32,800
It's

103
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,920
hu-human head.

00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,680
- This...
- A human head?

105
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,800
It is a human head.

106
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,680
Whose head is this?

107
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,879
It's the head of prince

108
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,040
of Xuanhuang, Nanshang.

109
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,040
Shu,

110
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,160
what is going on here?

111
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:44,879
Father,

112
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,079
at that time,

113
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:48,839
he was trapped in a struggle

114
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:51,399
with the Xuanhuang barbarians
to save us.

115
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:52,839
Later, Marquis Cheng'en

116
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,199
rescued us.

117
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,879
We thought

118
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,079
he would die in that forest.

119
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,680
In your opinion,

120
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:01,728
how should I

121
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,160
reward him?

122
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,439
Mu Han has done a great job.

123
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,480
Naturally, we should reward him

124
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:08,399
to show royal demeanor.

125
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,480
The glory should belong to him.

126
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:12,439
I appoint Mu Han

127
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,360
as the commander

128
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,720
of the Imperial Guards

129
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,240
and I grant him a mansion.

130
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:20,439
Marquis Cheng'en,

131
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,759
I reward you with gold

132
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:24,319
and South Sea Pearls.

133
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:25,959
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

134
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:35,839
Mu Han,

135
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:39,000
about the matter of setting fire,

136
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,240
I was unaware.

137
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:41,639
Rest assured.

138
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:43,639
Even though I'm not by your side,

139
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:45,439
Corpse Bellflower is still inside me.

140
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,959
I still can't escape your control.

141
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:50,319
General Mu,

142
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,639
thank you for saving my life.

143
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,319
This jade Buddha

144
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,639
was given to me on my birthday

145
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:56,959
by my mother.

146
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,360
It can ensure safety.

147
00:07:58,759 --> 00:07:59,480
Now

148
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:00,839
I give it to you

149
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,800
to congratulate you.

150
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,000
General Mu,

151
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,399
she's always like this.

152
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,720
Don't mind her.

153
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,600
Your gift is too precious.

154
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,079
I dare not accept it.

155
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,959
Your Majesty,

156
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,159
since the Princess's miscarriage,

157
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:34,960
the physicians often

158
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,240
come to check her health.

159
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,279
Everything's fine.

160
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,480
However,

161
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,120
no signs of pregnancy.

162
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,799
Your Majesty,

163
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,679
my sister...

164
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,120
You can work with peace of mind.

165
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,279
In the future,

166
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:51,440
I will arrange for you to meet her.

167
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,440
Thank you, Your Majesty.

168
00:08:59,488 --> 00:09:00,832
(To Your Majesty.)

169
00:09:02,912 --> 00:09:05,472
(Lord of the World. Prosperous Forever)

170
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,399
Your Majesty,

171
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:08,840
this is freshly drawn virgin blood.

172
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:09,879
And it's still warm.

173
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,919
What happened
to this group of young women?

174
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:19,000
Your Majesty,

175
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:21,399
I carried out the sacrifice
as per your orders.

176
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,639
But it seems that
the blood spirit does not appear.

177
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,879
Maybe the sacrifices are not enough.

178
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,919
Then

179
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,879
continue to find!

180
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:28,736
Yes!

181
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:34,480
(Now the power of the blood spirit
is getting weaker and weaker.)

182
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:37,000

183
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,320

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,320
