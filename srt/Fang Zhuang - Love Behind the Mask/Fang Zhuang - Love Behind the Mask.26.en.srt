=Episode 26=

3
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,840
How is she?

4
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:05,359
She took the poison
that can deprive all her five senses.

5
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:07,799
When it acts,
she'll lose all five senses

6
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,560
and suffer excruciating pain.

7
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:11,200
I'm afraid it's untreatable.

8
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,680
It's better to give her a quick death.

9
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,239
Is there any way to detoxify her?

10
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,319
If all the poisoned blood
in her body is drained out,

11
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:26,840
she might be able to escape death.

12
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,519
But I dare not say for sure
if this method will work.

13
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:33,079
Everything

14
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,200
depends on her fortune.

15
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:00,640
(She'll suffer unbearable pain
during the blood transfusion.)

16
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,400
(Please have her take this medicine.)

17
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:10,759
Young Master,

18
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,319
are you sure about this?

19
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:16,199
You may leave now.

20
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,879
You still

21
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,240
have mercy for her.

22
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:01,719
Send a few people

23
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:02,680
to guard her.

24
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:03,439
Yes.

25
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:06,400
Lord Mu,

26
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,960
Her Highness summons you.

27
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,759
Please follow me into the palace.

28
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,680
You're here.

29
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,120
Now

30
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:33,600
the late emperor has died,

31
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,399
and the court and the public
are in chaos.

32
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:37,879
It won't be long

33
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:39,319
before I ascend the throne.

34
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:42,480
If you marry me now,

35
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:45,519
you will have the world.

36
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,800
What do you think?

37
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,720
I have no interest

38
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,439
and no desire

39
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:52,560
to be with you.

40
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,360
Then why did you

41
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,680
agree to marry me

42
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,759
back then?

43
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,480
It was just

44
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:03,839
an expedient measure back then.

45
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:11,600
What if I insist

46
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,120
on keeping you by my side?

47
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,519
Don't threaten me.

48
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,360
Mu Han,

49
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:27,240
I wonder

50
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,680
if you like

51
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,720
the great gift I sent.

52
00:05:33,587 --> 00:05:35,864
(Princess Royal's Mansion)

53
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,199
With me here,

54
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,560
no one can harm her.

55
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,040
Die!

56
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:19,160
Let's go.

57
00:06:27,936 --> 00:06:28,768
Come on.

58
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:46,079
Get the imperial guards!

59
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,680
Xuanhuang's spies are here.

60
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:48,519
Yes.

61
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,639
Stop.

62
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,160
Stop there.

63
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:57,759
Stop.

64
00:06:58,639 --> 00:06:59,120
After her!

65
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,079
Mu Han!

66
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,560
Mu Han!

67
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:09,639
Why are you ignoring me?

68
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,399
Go in!

69
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,120
Hide inside.

70
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,360
Don't make a sound.

71
00:07:22,452 --> 00:07:24,448
(Yeting)

72
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:27,839
Search!

73
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,279
Young Master.

74
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:33,040
All the Xuanhuang people are killed.

75
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,279
They were all spies planted in Tiandu.

76
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,319
General Mu,

77
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,639
Princess Fuyu is gone.

78
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,600
Seal the city gates.

79
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:39,759
Hurry and find her.

80
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,040
Yes.

81
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:49,218
(Princess Royal's Mansion)

82
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,152
Young Master.

83
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:08,839
What happened?

84
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:11,839
Last night,

85
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:14,199
the guards were drugged

86
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,079
and Wen Yanshu's bedchamber

87
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:17,319
was burned down.

88
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,319
Only the jade pendant was left behind.

89
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:37,840
Young Master?

90
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:43,679
Young Master!

91
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,679
She can't be dead.

92
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:49,720
She can't be dead.

93
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,240
She must be hiding.

94
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:54,440
She must be hiding.

95
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,240
Wen Yanshu!

96
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:58,120
You can't be dead.

97
00:08:58,919 --> 00:08:59,799
Wen Yanshu,

98
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:02,360
no matter where you're hiding,

99
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:05,720
I will definitely find you.

100
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,000
She's already safe.

101
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,039
Can you take care of yourself?

102
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,639
Your hand

103
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:25,600
needs treatment.

104
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,519
Do you think

105
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,919
Mu Han

106
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,919
will go madly searching for her?

107
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:44,919
Anning!

108
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,080
Anning!

109
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:48,960
Quickly take her away.

110
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,000
Are you okay,

111
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:54,759
Anning?

112
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:01,879
Go!

113
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,159
Your Highness,

114
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,639
from today on,

115
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,519
I hope you'll be happy and worry-free.

116
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:22,799
Wen Yanshu is already dead.

117
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,759
He will accept this outcome.

118
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:34,200
Anning,

119
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,840
you're awake.

120
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:42,159
Who are you people?

121
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,720
