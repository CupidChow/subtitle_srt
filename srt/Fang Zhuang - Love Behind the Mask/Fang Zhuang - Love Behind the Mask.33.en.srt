Her face has offended me.

196
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,200
You abandoned me for her

197
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,639
and got me captured

198
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:57,759
by Xuanhuang.

199
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,960
It's all your fault.

200
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:02,639
Bring the whip.

201
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,360
Yes.

202
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:13,159
What will you do?

203
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:15,200
This is

204
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:17,519
what you and Wen Yanshu owe me.

205
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:18,960
Wen Fuyu, don't harm him!

206
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:20,159
Come at me if you dare.

207
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,559
I can't stand it that you're so

208
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:24,639
aloof about everything,

209
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,480
but only show concern

210
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,679
for her.

211
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,399
It makes me feel sick.

212
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:31,679
Wen Fuyu,

213
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,679
what exactly do you want to do?

214
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:34,879
Come at me if you dare.

215
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,679
Don't touch him!

216
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,639
Shut up!

217
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:38,440
It's none of your business here!

218
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:39,960
Yuechan,

219
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:41,559
take her away!

220
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,600
Where do you take her?

221
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,600
You'd better behave!

222
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,759
Otherwise,

223
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,519
I'll scar her face.

224
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:52,559
Go.

225
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:53,080
Mu Han.

226
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:53,639
Shu.

227
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,039
Come on, cheers.

228
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:18,039
What's up?

229
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:18,679
Go on.

230
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:19,639
Come on, cheers.

231
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,480
Never mind!

232
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:21,519
Come on.

233
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:22,519
Cheers.

234
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:37,919
Your Highness.

235
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,639
Beautiful.

236
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,399
Truly beautiful.

237
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,120
So beautiful.

238
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:53,639
Well,

239
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:54,679
let me kiss you.

240
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,320
Back off.

241
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,320
Don't touch me.

242
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:01,759
Report!

243
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,240
Your Highness,

244
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,759
we're surrounded by enemies.

245
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,240
Linzhao.

246
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,840
What happened?

247
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,799
How could we have offended Linzhao?

248
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,919
Is this your doing?

249
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,120
No.

250
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,200
Your Highness,

251
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,399
she...

252
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:20,399
She is

253
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:22,200
Lord of Zishang's beloved.

254
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,480
If we take her

255
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,000
as a hostage, they won't hurt us.

256
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:25,600
No.

257
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:26,879
Don't be fooled.

258
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:27,759
I'm not.

259
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:32,480
Come with me.

260
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,480
Your Highness,

261
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,240
take me with you.

262
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,120
I belong to you.

263
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,240
You can't leave me behind.

264
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:37,639
Get lost!

265
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,399
Come with me.

266
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:03,919
Kill them.

267
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,679
What should we do?

268
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,279
Go to Yunzhou.

269
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,200
I will slaughter them.

270
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:11,759
Let's go!

271
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:18,799
Bai Ling.

272
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:22,559
They're

273
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:24,200
heading towards Yunzhou.

274
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,039
Chase them!

275
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,328
(Yuefu Gate)

276
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,039
Shu.

277
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,080
Listen!

278
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:36,799
Let her go now!

279
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,960
If you want to save her,

280
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,200
then

281
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,039
give Yunzhou

282
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:41,639
to me.

283
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:42,559
Otherwise,

284
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:45,120
I will kill her.

285
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,080
Shu.

286
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:47,559
What are you going to do?

287
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:48,440
Mu Han.

288
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:49,799
Mu Han, no.

289
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:51,799
If you give up Yunzhou,

290
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:53,159
the whole town's people

291
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,399
will become their victims.

292
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,240
No.

293
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,399
I give you one chance.

294
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,039
Either save the town,

295
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:01,000
or save her,

296
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,399
choose yourself.

297
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,440
My lord.

298
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,039
