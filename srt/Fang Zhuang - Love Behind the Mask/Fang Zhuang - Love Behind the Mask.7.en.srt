=Episode 7=

3
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,079
Greetings, Your Highness.

4
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:49,679
Get lost.

5
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,280
Yes.

6
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:01,880
Your Highness.

7
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:24,519
Thank you, Shu.

8
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:27,959
I won't let anything happen to you.

9
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:42,040
What is so special about Mu Han

10
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:43,959
that makes you defend him so much?

11
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:45,920
I'm already pregnant

12
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:47,760
with Mu Han's child.

13
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Father,

14
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:50,519
please spare Mu Han.

15
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,760
You're pregnant?

16
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,159
Why didn't you say so earlier?

17
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:00,879
I'm fine.

18
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,719
It's just that Mu Han...

19
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,239
Attempting to harm a princess
is a serious crime.

20
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:07,519
Besides, you are pregnant.

21
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,479
His background is unknown,
so he can't be spared.

22
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,800
If you like someone like him,

23
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:14,240
once you've given birth

24
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:15,280
to a grandson for me,

25
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,360
I will reward you with a few more.

26
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:18,280
Father,

27
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:19,479
he is my child's father.

28
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:20,280
If he is gone,

29
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,000
I can't get through my pregnancy.

30
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,719
Also,

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,039
Mu Han didn't harm Princess Jiyao.

32
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:27,159
He spent the entire last night

33
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,680
sleeping with me.

34
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,560
He couldn't possibly have poisoned her.

35
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:31,520
But why

36
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:34,159
was his bell found in Jiyao's room?

37
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,599
Mu Han's bell was lost a few days ago.

38
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,400
Someone with ill intentions picked it up

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,319
to frame him on purpose.

40
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,360
Father, punish me

41
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,280
if you must.

42
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:48,319
Alright.

43
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,240
As long as you

44
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,439
get through your pregnancy

45
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:54,000
and give birth to a grandson for me,

46
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,800
I will spare Mu Han.

47
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,360
Thank you, Father.

48
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,240
Your Majesty!

49
00:02:58,879 --> 00:02:59,520
Your Majesty,

50
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,759
the physician said

51
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:02,599
that Princess Jiyao is unconscious

52
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,639
and in grave danger.

53
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,400
She might not make it.

54
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:07,400
How could it be so sudden?

55
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,919
Princess Jiyao is weak

56
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,520
and severely injured.

57
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,319
She is unconscious

58
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:13,639
and can't take medicine.

59
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:31,960
Jiyao's maternal grandfather
is a grand noble of Zhuyan.

60
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,560
If we cannot save her,

61
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:35,439
we will offend Zhuyan.

62
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:37,000
Then make Mu Han

63
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,800
pay with his life.

64
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,919
Yes, Your Majesty.

65
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,599
If Princess Jiyao is safe and sound,

66
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,240
could you issue a decree

67
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,400
to release Mu Han?

68
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:46,919
I promise you

69
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,639
that as long as Jiyao is fine,

70
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:49,759
I

71
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:50,960
will release Mu Han.

72
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,080
But with Jiyao's current situation,

73
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:55,840
the imperial physicians are at a loss.

74
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,879
I advise you

75
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:58,479
not to waste your effort.

76
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,360
I am willing to give it a try

77
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:03,240
for the sake of my child.

78
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:05,919
Alright.

79
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,000
I will allow it.

80
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,919
Thank you, Father.

81
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:14,800
Shu,

82
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,560
are you really carrying his child?

83
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
So what if I am?

84
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,240
You once said

85
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,040
he was just your plaything.

86
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:24,839
How could you carry his child?

87
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,839
I'm just having a child. That's all.

88
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:31,920
If you mind,

89
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,519
you can sever all ties with me.

90
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:36,399
Shu,

91
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:37,600
you know

92
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:39,680
it isn't your child that I care about.

93
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,160
What bothers me

94
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:44,360
is that he doesn't deserve you
risking your life for him.

95
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:47,639
If you have nothing else to say,

96
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:49,240
I'll be leaving now.

97
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,560
Judging by the pulse,

98
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,279
her injuries aren't severe.

99
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:18,240
But she is unconscious all day
and can't take medicine.

100
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:19,680
Her will to survive is weak.

101
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,839
I'm afraid

102
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:22,360
she is dying.

103
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,680
Weak will to survive?

104
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,959
She doesn't seem like that to me.

105
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,000
Physician Sun,

106
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,439
prescribe a few more doses of medicine.

107
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,279
Remember to personally
decoct the medicine.

108
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:33,399
Don't entrust it to others.

109
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:34,439
Yes.

110
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,759
You...

111
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:01,759
What are you doing?

112
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,879
Someone!

113
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,959
Help!

114
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,959
Someone, help!

115
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,000
Your Highness, you finally woke up.

116
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:10,839
You scared me to death.

117
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:12,040
She's not dead yet.

118
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,839
Save your tears.

119
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:13,879
Remember

120
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:15,800
to feed her the medicine

121
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,879
personally decocted by Physician Sun.

122
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,319
Wen Yanshu

123
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:25,720
dared to assassinate me
while I was sick.

124
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:28,959
I must tell His Majesty.

125
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:29,879
Your Highness,

126
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,879
you couldn't take medicine

127
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,199
since you had been unconscious.

128
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,959
The Princess Royal saved you.

129
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,759
Wen Yanshu

130
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,759
saved me?

131
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,879
I don't believe she'd be so kind.

132
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:01,000
Get out.

133
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,560
Marquis, what do you mean by this?

134
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,279
What do I mean?

135
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:09,000
If it were not for Shu,

136
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:14,240
I would like to kill you.

137
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:44,639
Shu.

138
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,040
When Shu's child grows up

139
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,000
and knows their father

140
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:58,680
is such a lowly person like you,

141
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,639
he'll definitely not acknowledge you.

142
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,519
It seems like

143
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,600
you're quite self-aware.

144
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:07,079
What do you mean?

145
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,279
What do I mean?

146
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:12,160
You know very well.

147
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,319
Your injury is severe.

148
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,519
Go back and get treated.

149
00:08:30,067 --> 00:08:32,607
(Princess Royal's Mansion)

150
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,679
So the father

151
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,279
of the child you are carrying

152
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,879
is He Chuan?

153
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,399
It doesn't matter.

154
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,679
You just need to know

155
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,519
now everyone thinks

156
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,080
you are the child's father,

157
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,279
and that's enough.

158
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,399
Your Highness,

159
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,120
by His Majesty's order, Lord Qiya

160
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,399
is here with supplements.

161
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,039
He's waiting in the main hall.

162
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:11,200
Your Highness,

163
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,759
His Majesty is very concerned
about your health.

164
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,720
He ordered me and Physician Sun

165
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,600
to visit you

166
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,440
with supplements

167
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,840
and

168
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:21,039
treat Guard Mu at the same time.

169
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,200
His Majesty is so kind.

170
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:25,240
Once Mu Han is feeling better,

171
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,840
I'll take him with me

172
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,039
to thank His Majesty.

173
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:29,799
Then I shall take my leave.

174
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:31,840
Wait.

175
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,840
Lately,

176
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,320
during the night,

177
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:43,759
I somehow have a severe headache.

178
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,080
Physician Sun should stay and treat me.

179
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:50,480
And I recently got some good wine.

180
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,120
How about

181
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,799
you try the wine before you go?

182
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,559
Then, I shall follow your command.

183
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,120
Thank you for your kindness.

184
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:05,600
It's the Carefree Powder.

185
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,159
Colorless and tasteless,

186
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:09,240
it can drain one's internal strength

187
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:10,559
and kill them suddenly

188
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,360
without being detected.

189
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:23,519
I am pregnant.

190
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:25,360
So I'll have tea instead of wine

191
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,039
to toast you.

192
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,720
This wine is a precious collection.

193
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,240
You must savor it well.

194
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:34,080
Thank you, Your Highness.

195
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,919
This wine...

196
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,200
What?

197
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:42,480
Not to your liking?

198
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,360
Fine wine.

199
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,000
Your Highness,
Physician Sun is ready.

200
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,120
Please go.

201
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:03,120
Take your time to savor.

202
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:04,519
Excuse me

203
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,840
for a moment.

204
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,000
Thank you.

205
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,799
Fine wine.

206
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:47,200
Thank you.

207
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,720
A token from me.

208
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:54,279
Mister,

209
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,600
he was born in a year, month,
and hour dominated by yin

210
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,639
and is an orphan.

211
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:00,759
He's a perfect candidate
to be a ghost husband.

212
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,759
I'll take him.

213
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:03,720
Let's go.

214
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:20,559
Guard Mu,

215
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,080
how dare you!

216
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,720
You dare to assassinate
in the Princess Royal's Mansion.

217
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,000
You dare to plot against me.

218
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,200
Today

219
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,759
is the day you die.

220
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:45,200
You...!

221
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,919
Within three days,

222
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,679
the entire city's people must know

223
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,360
Princess Liangyin's ghost husband

224
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:55,600
is exceptionally handsome.

225
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:58,480
Thank you, Lord.

226
00:12:58,519 --> 00:12:59,679
I'm on it right away.

227
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,600
Young Master.

228
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,440
(Bai Ling, Si Yichen's Guard)
It's you.

229
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,399
You're still alive.

230
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,919
I thought you...

231
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,639
To get close to Wen Yanshu

232
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:26,559
and for revenge,

233
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,639
I need your help with something.

234
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,360
I'm willing

235
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:32,919
to do anything for you.

236
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,039
Mu Han?

237
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,799
Take this away.

238
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,519
Mu Han,

239
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,600
I serve His Majesty.

240
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:20,159
How dare you kill me?

241
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,399
Qiya will visit here today.

242
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,200
We must not miss this opportunity.

243
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,720
Why do you want
to kill Qiya at this place?

244
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,720
If Qiya dies here,

245
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,960
it'll cause a rift between His Majesty
and the Princess Royal.

246
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,440
That way, all your previous efforts

247
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:43,960
will be in vain.

248
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:46,600
His Majesty dotes on his daughter.

249
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:48,679
Even if Qiya

250
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:49,960
dies in her mansion,

251
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,480
His Majesty will not blame her.

252
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,639
Do you know who I am?

253
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:03,679
Who are you?

254
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,600
You are not worthy.
