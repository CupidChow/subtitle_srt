=Episode 23=

3
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,719
I remember when we first met.

4
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:53,719
In Linzhao,

5
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,200
there was
a once-in-a-century heavy snow.

6
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,280
Back then,

7
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,119
my mother and I
had wandered for many years,

8
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,239
homeless.

9
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,040
Mother, wake up.

10
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:12,359
It's snowing.

11
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,480
I'm begging you.

12
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:38,799
Miss,

13
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:41,560
please save my mother. I'm begging you.

14
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,280
Mother,

15
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:06,040
we have money now.

16
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,719
We can go to the clinic.

17
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,639
Let's go.

18
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:10,919
I'm taking you to the clinic.

19
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:16,479
Mother?

20
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:22,439
Mother?

21
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,879
Mother!

22
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:28,719
Mother!

23
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,199
Sorry.

24
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,080
I don't remember very clearly.

25
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,360
It's okay.

26
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:41,280
I'll tell you.

27
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:47,759
Only then

28
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:49,639
did I know that you were

29
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,000
the Princess Royal of Linzhao.

30
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:59,960
(I thought of many ways
to find you and thank you.)

31
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,280
(But it was hard to get close.)

32
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,560
(Until one day,
I saw you parading with many toyboys.)

33
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:11,599
(I disguised myself as one of them)

34
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:15,319
(- and entered your mansion to witness...)
- Don't touch me!

35
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,039
Stop.

36
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:29,039
Are you alright?

37
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:30,879
(To thank me,)

38
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,639
(you were to give me money
and let me go.)

39
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,680
(But I refused.)

40
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,520
(I wanted to stay)

41
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,960
(and find the cause for your grief)

42
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,120
(and why you lived such a life.)

43
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:44,159
Yanshu, you've become so weak.

44
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,280
You can't even stand up.

45
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,319
Come on.

46
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,159
Let me help you up.

47
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,879
What's going on?

48
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,520
People might think I did it on purpose.

49
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:51,319
Unbelievable.

50
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,840
Shu,

51
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,280
are you alright?

52
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,488
(Your sisters bullied you.)

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,360
(Palace servants shunned you.)

54
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,199
(- I didn't understand.)
- It's okay now.

55
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,560
(- You were so nice.)
- Let's go.

56
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,759
(Why was there no one willing
to stand by your side?)

57
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:14,280
If you don't want to have children

58
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,680
and insist on keeping only He Chuan,

59
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,079
then don't blame me for being ruthless.

60
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,480
You will fall

61
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,639
into the same fate as your mother.

62
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,839
Father, I beg you.

63
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,680
Father!

64
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,920
Drag her out.

65
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,120
Let her repent in Yeting.

66
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,279
Yes.

67
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:32,439
(Your nerves broke down even more.)

68
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,560
(You refused the toyboys
His Majesty gave you)

69
00:04:36,384 --> 00:04:38,040
(- and only kept me.)
- Your Highness.

70
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,399
Your Highness!

71
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:41,519
(- You even defied His Majesty.)
- Your Majesty.

72
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:42,480
Please don't.

73
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,360
Your Majesty!

74
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:49,152
(Yeting)
(Punishment.)

75
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:50,639
(Poison.)

76
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,040
(Seeing you in distress,)

77
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:55,920
(the empress couldn't wait
to get rid of you.)

78
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:59,319
(No matter how many wounds
you suffered,)

79
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:02,279
(you wouldn't bow your head
to His Majesty.)

80
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:06,839
(Until the moment
she really struck to kill...)

81
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,040
How dare you kill them?

82
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,720
Quickly report to Her Majesty.

83
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,000
Shu.

84
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,120
Am I dying?

85
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,240
Why can my eyes

86
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,439
only see red?

87
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:38,120
Shu,

88
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,319
if you can only see red,

89
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,399
from now on,

90
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,480
we'll only wear red clothes.

91
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,199
So you won't see blood.

92
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,120
(In the end, His Majesty)

93
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,519
(went soft and released you
from Yeting.)

94
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,800
(And he already found out)

95
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,480
(I'm the illegitimate son expelled
by the Lord of Zishang,)

96
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,399
(and I hated him to the bone.)

97
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,519
(For the future reclamation of Zishang,)

98
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,160
(he took me in.)

99
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:03,560
From now on,

100
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,519

101
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:10,959

Brother,

122
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,879
I'm so afraid that one day

123
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:51,800
I will be dragged back to Yeting.

from now on,

129
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,839
we will only wear red?

130
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,319
