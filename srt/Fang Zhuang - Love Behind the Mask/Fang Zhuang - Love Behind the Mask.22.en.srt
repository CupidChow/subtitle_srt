He Chuan,

Isn't General Mu going to battle?

Why is he tied up?

53
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:26,400
I heard from a servant

54
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,680
that he is son of
the former Lord of Zishang.

55
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:30,319
He was discovered

56
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:33,120
and would be executed.

57
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,159
Those are the most elite soldiers.

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,599

What exactly does Wen Yanshu

61
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,120
want to do?

62
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:03,400
What's wrong?

63
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:05,159
Are you afraid?

64
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,080
You feel sorry, don't you?

65
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,759
You went through great efforts
to stay by my side,

66
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:15,199
just

67
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:17,360
to take revenge.

68
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,160
Yes.

69
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:24,800
Do you hate me?

70
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,360
Let me ask first.

71
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,000
Have you ever loved me?

72
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,480
Do you even deserve my love?

73
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,399
Do you know I was also
involved in massacre

74
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,560
at the Lord of Zishang's Mansion?

75
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:50,000
What did you say?

76
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,839
Long before going to Zishang,

77
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:55,160
I had thought of countless ways

78
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,439
to torture someone to death.

79
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,800
All were realized by Qiya.

80
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:04,000
You thought my hands
were not stained with blood.

81
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:05,519
In fact,

82
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,800
I was the one who gave the orders.

83
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:09,759
Wen Yanshu,

84
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,959
I'm going to kill you.

85
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,319
Getting angry already?

86
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,399
Oh, by the way,

87
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:20,279
I suddenly remembered there is another

88
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:21,879
important person.

89
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:24,240
Your fiancée,

90
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,519
Hang Anning.

91
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:29,560
It was you.

92
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:32,040
You killed her.

93
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:33,000
So what if I did?

94
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,920
You can't blame me for this.

95
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,920
She bumped into me.

96
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:40,600
She was thinking of you

97
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:42,560
until her last breath.

98
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,639
It was really tragic.

99
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:46,000
Oh, by the way,

100
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,879
on her body,

101
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:50,959
I also found

102
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:53,279
Myriad Threads.

103
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,360
The magical artifact
embedded in her body

104
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,680
was gouged out by me.

105
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:01,120
You lunatic!

106
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:04,000
Lunatic!

107
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,839
Since you are about to die,

108
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:12,120
I might as well tell you the truth.

109
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,319
Myriad Threads need

110
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:16,160
to be combined with the Evil Bone

111
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,920
to refine the Flower of Three Lives.

112
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:21,480
Its power can destroy
everything in the world.

113
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,439
What do you think

114
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,920
I go through great pains to
gain your trust for?

115
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,439
Of course, it's
for the Evil Bone inside you.

116
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,839
Shi'an.

117
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,639
Yichen, let's play.

118
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,040
Okay.

119
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,319
Yichen.

120
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:44,279
What's wrong?

121
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,040
Call Father.

122
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,759
Yichen.

123
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,839
Anning.

124
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:07,000
Yichen.

125
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,240
It's no longer safe.

126
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,079
I will escort Yichen
back to the mansion.

127
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,160
Bai Ling,

128
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:14,319
go pick up Anning.

129
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,040
(Anning,)

130
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,199
(Yichen's feeling fine.)

131
00:07:29,632 --> 00:07:31,600
(We'll be waiting
at Lord of Zishang's Mansion.)

132
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,600
(Father.)

133
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,720
(Yichen.)

134
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:37,088
(Execute the entire family
of Lord of Zishang)

135
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,360
(for plotting a rebellion.)

136
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,040
All of this is a joke.

137
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,560
(It turns out my madness)

138
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:47,279
(was because of the Evil Bone.)

139
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,480
From the first moment I saw you,

140
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,720
I was scheming

141
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,519
on how to induce
the Flower of Three Lives.

142
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:00,120
I went to great lengths
to make you love me and hate me,

143
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:02,199
just to take your power

144
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:03,399
for myself.

145
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:05,480
And make this world mine.

146
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:07,399
From now on, Linzhao

147
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,319
will rule for generations.

148
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:10,600
Slaughter

149
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:11,920
and brutality

150
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,839
will be its destiny.

151
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:20,959
Si Yichen,

152
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,519
in this world,

153
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,600
there is no such thing as justice.

154
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,439
I want you to fall with me

155
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,959
into depravity.

156
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:46,519
It's all a joke.

158
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,799

159

Wen Yanshu,

160
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,240
you should kill me now.

163
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,240
