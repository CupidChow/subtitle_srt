00:00:39,808 --> 00:00:41,280
=Episode 32=

3
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,320
Okay.

4
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,920
Don't get angry.

5
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:55,920
I admit

6
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,359
I have special feelings for you.

7
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,280
Even if you see me as Wen Yanshu,

8
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:03,679
could you belong to me,

9
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,519
even if just for a moment?

10
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:14,359
Okay.

11
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:16,480
I promise you.

12
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,599
Let's take it slow.

13
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:20,359
I'm not in a hurry.

14
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,920
I'll come back.

15
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,439
Wangyou,

16
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:33,560
he is not sincere to you.

17
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,519
Forget him.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Come back with me.

19
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:38,879
He is not sincere to me.

20
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:39,719
What about you?

21
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:42,719
Didn't you also see me as Wen Yanshu?

22
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,519
Of course not.

23
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,760
Listen!

24
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:46,159
I...

25
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:46,920
No.

26
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:48,599
You may leave.

27
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,520
My lord,

28
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,719
Miss Wangyou has escaped.

29
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:36,280
Seal the city gates

30
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,639
and find her quickly.

31
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:37,879
Yes.

32
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:38,719
No need.

33
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:45,840
Yichen,

34
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,319
she came to see me before she left.

35
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:51,319
She said she would
never step into the mansion.

36
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,719
If you push her again,

37
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:54,800
she'll prove her resolve with death.

38
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:08,879
Stop!

39
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,280
Show your permission.

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,479
Please.

41
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:28,719
Your...

42
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:29,199
Where's she?

43
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,080
Didn't I ask you to bring her here?

44
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,280
The situation was very critical.

45
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:35,319
To avoid getting caught by guards,

46
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,879
I let her go there herself.

47
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,479
If she is safe,

48
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,840
go get punishment.

49
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:41,759
If she gets in trouble,

50
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,520
you're done!

51
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:53,680
My lord,

52
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,400
we followed Prince Zhuyan

53
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,120
and found Miss Wangyou.

54
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,039
Wangyou.

55
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:04,639
Shu.

56
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,560
Stop!

57
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,479
- Wangyou.
- Shu.

58
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:07,639
Shu.

59
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:10,400
Wangyou.

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,360
Wangyou.

61
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,400
Shu.

62
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,439
What are you doing?

63
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,199
Stop!

64
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,560
If you get closer, I'll jump.

65
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:16,839
Calm down.

66
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,079
Come back with me.

67
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:20,000
Calm down.

68
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,120
Come over, please.

69
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:22,079
Come over.

70
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:22,959
Please don't act

71
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,000
on impulse.

72
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,519
Stop!

73
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,040
Both of you

74
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,199
see me as her.

75
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,560
I told you I am not.

76
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,720
I am Nalan Wangyou.

77
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,720
No.

78
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,720
I have never taken you for Wen Yanshu.

79
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:36,519
In my heart...

80
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:38,040
You want me to be your wife.

81
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,639
And you want to trap me.

82
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:43,399
You love Wen Yanshu,

83
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,079
not me.

84
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:45,680
Alright.

85
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,480
Alright.

86
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:48,480
Calm down.

87
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:49,920
As long as you come over,

88
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,800
I will agree

89
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:51,879
to whatever you do.

90
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,879
I don't believe it.

91
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:55,839
I don't believe you.

92
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:56,879
Stop!

93
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,759
If you come closer, I will jump.

94
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,360
Wangyou.

95
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:05,839
Shu.

96
00:05:06,036 --> 00:05:07,853
♪Tormenting every inch of blood♪

97
00:05:08,823 --> 00:05:13,337
♪In exchange for your smile♪

98
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,079
Find her

99
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,079
quickly!

100
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:18,920
Yes.

101
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,560
Shu.

102
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:24,959
Wangyou.

103
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,199
Shu.

104
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:27,759
Bai Ling,

105
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:29,360
how's it going?

106
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,360
I still haven't found Miss Yanshu.

107
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:32,839
How about you, my lord?

108
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:34,279
If it weren't for you,

109
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,800
she wouldn't have jumped.

110
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,959
Go on.

111
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,399
Shu.

112
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,360
Shu.

113
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:44,399
Report!

114
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:46,399
His Majesty

115
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:47,399
has passed away.

116
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,519
What?

117
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,240
You all continue to search.

118
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:53,839
Yes.

119
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:54,959
Go!

120
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:03,160
Shu.

121
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,600
Shu.

122
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,000
Shu.

123
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,120
Shu.

124
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:20,159
(Secret: Mu Han is Si Yichen.)

125
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,582
(He likes a girl similar to Yanshu.)

126
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:23,519
Mu Han.

127
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:25,160
Si Yichen.

128
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:28,360
You bring me trouble,

129
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:30,160
and I won't let you off, either.

130
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,639
Similar to Wen Yanshu?

131
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,120
Fine.

132
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,160
I will

133
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,720
make you experience separation again.

134
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,399
Yuechan,

135
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,199
I'll leave it to you.

136
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,120
There will be benefits for you
if you handle it well.

137
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,199
Don't worry.

138
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:50,800
I will definitely handle it properly.

139
00:06:58,759 --> 00:06:59,279
Shu.

140
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:00,879
Hold on.

141
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:02,800
Bai Ling is arriving soon.

142
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:04,680
I'm not Shu.

143
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,319
Won't you let me go?

144
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:10,319
Sorry.

145
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,439
Sorry.

146
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:13,360
Calm down.

147
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,680
After you recover from injuries,

148
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,920
you can go wherever you want.

149
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,839
I won't restrict you anymore.

150
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,759
Hold on.

151
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,759
It's okay.

152
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,759
Hold on.

153
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,519
Shu.

154
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,519
(I don't know why you lost memory.)

155
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,040
(But as long as)

156
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,439
(you're alive,)

157
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,199
(I will be satisfied.)

158
00:07:32,212 --> 00:07:34,464
(Princess Royal's Mansion)

159
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:44,639
My lord,

160
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,519
Miss Wangyou is severely injured.

161
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:48,079
She needs to rest

162
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:49,279
before waking up.

163
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,639
Got it.

164
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,720
You may leave now.

165
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:52,480
Yes.

166
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:05,184
(Princess Royal's Mansion)

167
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,920
Shu,

168
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,120
you're awake.

169
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:29,439
Shu.

170
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,240
What's wrong with you?

171
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:38,799
Physician,

172
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,080
what happened?

173
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,000
My lord,

174
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,799
her head was traumatized

175
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,159
from falling off a cliff.

176
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,440
She just needs
to rest well for some days.

177
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,639
These few days,

178
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,879
I won't come to disturb you.

179
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,399
Focus on recuperating.

180
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,080
When you get well,

181
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,519
I will come to see you.

182
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,000
(So it turns out)

183
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,159
(I am Wen Yanshu.)

184
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:29,120
(Si Yichen,)

185
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,120
(you can't forget about me.)

186
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:33,279
(Why did you want to kill me back then?)

187
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,600
(In your heart,)

188
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,159
(am I significant to you?)

189
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:06,480
My lord,

190
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,799
Wen Yanshu went missing.

191
00:10:10,773 --> 00:10:12,704
(If you want to save her,
come to outside city, Xuanhuang)

192
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:15,840
Xuanhuang?

193
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:18,480
Why could Xuanhuang take her?

194
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,200
How would they know

195
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,080
Wangyou is Miss Wangyou?

196
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,240
Could it be

197
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:25,120
Prince Zhuyan?

198
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,120
Bai Ling,

199
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:27,720
go to Zhuyan.

200
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,000
I'll go to Xuanhuang.

201
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,799
Your Highness.

202
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,320
Any news?

203
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,360
No.

204
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,600
Under the manipulation of the Lord,

205
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:49,840
everyone wants
to change the Crown Prince.

206
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,440
Before the session,

207
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,279
if His Highness does not appear...

208
00:10:55,879 --> 00:10:56,720
The lord

209
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:58,799
won't let him return Zhuyan easily.

210
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,080
Since His Highness is not here,

211
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:06,519
I'll guard the throne

212
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,799
for him.

213
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:16,519
What is going on here?

214
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:18,240
His Majesty's been dead for days.

215
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,519
And he's still wandering.

216
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,120
In my opinion,

217
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:22,639
this Crown Prince

218
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:24,200
should have been replaced.

219
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,960
You are the epitome
of sincerity and filial piety,

220
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,399
wise and heroic.

221
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,919
So you are the only choice
to succeed the king.

222
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,399
You all are truly talents of Zhuyan.

223
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,000
My father has not yet been
laid in the imperial tomb.

224
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:37,799
And you all

225
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:39,399
are already thinking of rebelling?

226
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,120
Your Highness.

227
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:48,759
You may rise.

228
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,200
Thank you, Your Highness.

229
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,759
Your Highness.

230
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,799
Why are you wearing a mask today?

231
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:56,600
My father has passed away.

232
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,919
And I have not yet recovered

233
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:00,559
from the pain.

234
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:01,600
Can't show my face.

235
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:03,320
Is that so?

236
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,279
I think

237
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,759
you are not the Crown Prince.

238
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,000
You...

239
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:22,360
Dared to impersonate His Highness.

240
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:23,919
Guards!

241
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:26,879
Seize her for me.

242
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:27,799
Yes.

243
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,440
You dare?

244
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,879
Let go of me, let go of me!

245
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,080
When he returns,

246
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,320
you'll hold accountable.

247
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:55,519
You're awake.

248
00:13:01,268 --> 00:13:02,432
(Mansion of War King)

249
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,240
If you dare touch me,

250
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,480
His Highness

251
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,639
won't spare you.

252
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,440
His Highness?

253
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:30,320
He won't be coming back.

254
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,519
You should

255
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,879
give up on that hope.

256
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:35,919
What did you do to him?

257
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,840
What did I do to him?

258
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,440
I

259
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,519
make him dead.

260
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:43,559
Sweetie.

261
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,440
Enjoy this night.

262
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,080
I guarantee no one can disturb us.

263
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,919
Your Highness.

264
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,840
Qinxue.

265
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:20,639
