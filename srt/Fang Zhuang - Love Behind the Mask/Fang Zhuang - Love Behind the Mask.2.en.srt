=Love Behind the Mask=

2
00:00:39,712 --> 00:00:40,920
=Episode 2=

3
00:00:41,632 --> 00:00:43,159
(Princess Yuan Jiyao)
You dare to snatch the ghost husband.

4
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,600
Why don't you come out?

5
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:46,359
You...!

6
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:53,119
I will accept

7
00:00:53,408 --> 00:00:54,880
your grand gesture of kneeling.

8
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,439
Princess Jiyao,

9
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:57,399
please rise quickly.

10
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,560
Hand over the man you snatched.

11
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,719
Man?

12
00:01:06,644 --> 00:01:09,657
(Prosperity Court)

13
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:12,519
These

14
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:15,000
are all the men I have snatched.

15
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,760
Princess Jiyao,

16
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:19,760
which one are you talking about?

17
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,680
I'm talking about

18
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:23,400
my sister's ghost husband,

19
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:24,280
Mu Han.

20
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,840
Mu Han?

21
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,760
He got tired of having fun with me.

22
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,000
Now

23
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:33,079
he's resting in the side hall.

24
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:34,000
You...

25
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:35,599
Shameless!

26
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:36,439
How audacious!

27
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:44,000
As a mere princess,

28
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,040
how dare you speak to me like this?

29
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:48,680
What is the punishment
for offending your superior?

30
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,760
Wen Yanshu,

31
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,760
take this!

32
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:52,560
Jiyao.

33
00:02:02,848 --> 00:02:04,896
(Second Princess Wen Fuyu)

34
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:09,080
Princess Liangyin and Jiyao
are twin sisters.

35
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,759
Liangyin passed away early.

36
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,599
And Jiyao has been grieving all day.

37
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,639
She meant no offense.
I hope you will forgive her.

38
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:17,039
But the ghost husband should be returned

39
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,840
to the Yuan family.

40
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,879
Since you have come,

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,080
why hide?

42
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:21,520
Come out.

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,800
Don't worry.

44
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:35,759
Even if it's just a dog from my mansion,

45
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,240
no one can take it away.

46
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,319
Jiyao.

47
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,960
Isn't it a waste

48
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,599
to give such a stunning beauty

49
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:55,120
to that dead person?

50
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:56,400
Instead,

51
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,439
we should leave him
for the living to enjoy.

52
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,199
What do you think?

53
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,719
Guards!

54
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,000
Burn this ghost husband

55
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,080
to death on the spot

56
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,159
to appease my sister's soul.

57
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:09,159
Who dares to do it in my mansion?

58
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:11,439
You are not worthy.

59
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,400
You...

60
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,520
Hold me.

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,319
Take care.

62
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,240
I won't see you out.

63
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,000
Wen Yanshu,

64
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:30,800
just wait.

65
00:03:31,124 --> 00:03:32,055
Humph.

66
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,120
I can't believe Yanshu.

67
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:44,080
(Empress of Linzhao)
She could have seized anyone.

68
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,400
(Emperor of Linzhao)
But she seized Liangyin's ghost husband

69
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,759
and caused the ministers
to submit a petition.

70
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,960
If you don't severely punish her,

71
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,039
I fear people's hearts
will not be at ease.

72
00:03:55,183 --> 00:03:56,064
(Everything Prospers Eternally)

73
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,360
I have misspoken.

74
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,240
Greetings, Father.

75
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:07,400
Shu, you're here.

76
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:08,960
Your Majesty.

77
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,319
I heard everything
Her Majesty just said.

78
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,279
Father, you know me.

79
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,439
I finally met someone I like.

80
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:20,079
I couldn't control myself.

81
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,000
Don't you always wish

82
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,000
for a grandson?

83
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,959
I trust you.

84
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,920
But you can make amends.

85
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:37,879
Find another ghost husband
with compatible birthdates

86
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:38,839
for the Yuan family.

87
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:39,759
Thank you, Father.

88
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:40,560
Also,

89
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,720
have He Chuan

90
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:42,839
bring Mu Han here

91
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,959
and deal with him
as a runaway ghost husband.

92
00:04:44,992 --> 00:04:47,120
Degrade him to a slave.
Execute the tattoo punishment.

93
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:48,120
Let it be

94
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,600
an explanation to the Yuans.

95
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:09,279
You lowly slave!

96
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:10,879
Today

97
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,920
is the day of your death.

98
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:16,199
You're doing this

99
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,720
because you fear
I'll take your place, right?

100
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:21,680
Killing me will only offend your backer.

101
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,040
Do you dare?

102
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,480
Let me.

103
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:13,920
According to Linzhao's law,

104
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:15,560
the prisoner's face

105
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,279
should be tattooed.

106
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,879
I tattoo

107
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,519
wherever I want.

108
00:06:38,452 --> 00:06:40,384
(Slave)

109
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,600
Remember this feeling.

110
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,800
This is just the beginning.

111
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:01,040
(It is indeed just the beginning.)

112
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,879
So this is the ghost husband
the Princess Royal seized.

113
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,920
In broad daylight,

114
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,319
she's parading him in the streets.

115
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,160
Such behavior

116
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,480
is truly indecent.

117
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,839
I heard His Majesty is very indulgent
towards her

118
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,600
and has already gifted her this man.

119
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,680
Also,

120
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,319
he even allows her to keep toyboys.

121
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,079
So what?

122
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:39,199
I also heard

123
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,759
many of the Princess Royal's toyboys

124
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:43,000
were bestowed by His Majesty.

125
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:46,360
(He has no reaction.)

126
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,560
(Can't humiliating him in this way)

127
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,839
(arouse his hatred?)

128
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:20,879
Shu,

129
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:22,120
look

130
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:23,920
what I brought you.

131
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,519
This is Carefree Powder.

132
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,079
Colorless and tasteless.

133
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,160
It can erase one's internal strength,

134
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,480
causing a sudden death

135
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,279
without being detected.

136
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,919
And this.
A blood-red agate jade bracelet.

137
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,840
My people managed

138
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,000
to find it from Zhuyan State.

139
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,639
Its color is as pure

140
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,440
as fresh blood.

141
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:51,360
Take it away.

142
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:52,919
I don't like this color.

143
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:53,919
Are you joking?

144
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:55,360
I remember you liked red the most.

145
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:58,159
All those bodies lying around at
Lord of Zishang's Mansion.

146
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,000
And your fascination with blood

147
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,799
was

148
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:02,639
truly captivating.

149
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:08,440
It's bad.

150
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,159
His Majesty accused us of rebellion
and sent the Shadow Guards to kill us.

151
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,480
Si Sheng has betrayed us
and opened the city gate.

152
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,919
(Master.)

153
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,600
(Father.)

154
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:25,639
(Mother.)

155
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,039
Lord of Zishang and his wife were decent

156
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,039
and virtuous.

157
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,399
They weren't traitors.

158
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,000
Could His Majesty...

159
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:50,639
Shh.

160
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,600
Do you want to die?

161
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,799
(One day,)

162
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:29,360
(I'll make you pay the rightful price.)

163
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:38,159
(Myriad Threads react...)

164
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,600
