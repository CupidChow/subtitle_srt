13
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Mask?

14
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Is it me?

15
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Then that mask-wearing brother

16
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
He said something else to you?

17
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
He told me to open my eyes and then he left

18
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Cousin, do you know him?

19
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
No

20
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
By the way, why did you come to this Baiyu Village?

21
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I come

22
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You cannot tell them

23
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You cannot tell them

24
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Put it out

25
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Don't tell them

26
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I come to Baiyu Village to talk about something

27
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
But when I return

28
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
The head of village

29
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
They have

30
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Miss Cui Yu Ming Luan

31
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Please wait

32
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
How do you know my name?

33
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,980
aan

34
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,140
u

35
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,820
BMW

36
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,240
Sweetheart

37
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,060
Tusk

38
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,060
Push

39
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,980
Erik

40
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,980
Nuu

41
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,920
Fly

42
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,960
Ice

43
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,200
I see

44
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:45,600
Endless

45
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Can't see that clearly

46
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,120
I do, too

47
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,420
Demon look at the sky

48
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,420
There is such a magic weapon in the world.

49
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,900
But it's a little lacking.

50
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:34,020
There will be a formation in the water.

51
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:39,660
The formation's breath feels like it's evolving.

52
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,100
Who dares to enter the Life-Giving Pool?

53
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,900
It's you.

54
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:51,860
The one who passes the Life-Giving Pool must die.

55
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,420
Who dares to touch it?

56
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,420
This is the Golden Chalice?

57
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:12,420
Left Guardian, you indeed have a private interest.

58
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,420
It's not your turn to interfere.

59
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,420
She must die today.

60
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:21,420
You, the one who is covering up, are guilty.

61
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:25,420
Ye Yuan, you are too early.

62
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:41,420
The power of the empty demon in Jialan is really amazing.

63
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:47,420
Tell me, what's wrong with the Life-Giving Pool?

64
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:56,420
The Seven-Star Lotus Bead is about to pass.

65
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:00,420
I must find the Water Demon in the time of the rule.

66
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:04,420
There is the last piece of Golden Chalice in her body.

67
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:11,420
But the Water Demon was taken away by the Three Eyes that came twenty years ago.

68
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:16,420
What on earth do you want to use the Golden Chalice for?

69
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:20,420
The Golden Chalice is the most powerful magic weapon of the Imperial Family.

70
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:26,420
After the repair, the Nine-Legendary Man can use it to break the circle and release the black fire.

71
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,420
Everything is normal in the Life-Giving Pool today.

72
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:36,420
You have never seen the Red Night of the Golden Chalice, and you have never seen me.

73
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:55,420
I feel like something happened just now.

74
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:10,420
Many names of the demons in this list have been slipped away.

75
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,420
And you are one of them.

76
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:16,420
They said you escaped from the Four Jade Emperor.

77
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,420
What does the Four Jade Emperor mean?

78
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,420
What's the secret there?

79
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,420
I don't remember anything.

80
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,420
I can't help you.

81
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:33,420
Miss Cuiyu, why did you kill people in the White Jade Village?

82
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,420
I really don't remember anything.

83
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:42,420
There must be many secrets in the Bi Luo City that are unknown to everyone.

84
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:46,420
And you are the key to uncovering this secret.

85
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,420
So please think about it again.

86
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,420
Just because you went to the White Jade Village,

87
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,420
the Night Fiend has covered the whole village.

88
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:58,420
So this secret must be very important to Bi Luo City.

89
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:03,420
I only know that Bi Luo City is very dangerous.

90
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:07,420
I really can't remember anything else.

91
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:16,420
Miss Cuiyu, I can hypnotize.

92
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:19,420
But if you are conscious, you will lose your past.

93
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,420
If you don't mind...

94
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,420
I don't want to.

95
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,420
I don't want to know about that past.

96
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,420
You were hunted down by the people of Bi Luo City.

97
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,420
Bi Luo City is a chaotic city.

98
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:34,420
Only being with us is the best guarantee.

99
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,420
You can't even protect yourself.

100
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:40,420
Why are you still protecting me?

101
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:43,420
What do you mean?

102
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:51,420
This young man has severe internal and external injuries.

103
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,420
And his power has been exhausted.

104
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,420
He can't use the Sky Eye for a short time.

105
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:16,420
Miss Cuiyu, I heard that the Water Tribe is known as the Divine Doctor of the Demon Realm.

106
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:20,420
Can you prescribe a medicine to help my cousin?

107
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,420
I don't have any medicine.

108
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:31,420
Such a heartless person like you can cause a lot of pain.

109
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:34,420
Moreover, you cured this Yang guy.

110
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:38,420
Isn't that a good way to cover up the rain?

111
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,420
Forget it.

112
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:44,420
Since you saved my life, I can prescribe a medicine for you.

113
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:50,420
But the premise is that he wants to kill me.

114
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,420
How dare you?

115
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:02,420
How dare you break into the Water Tribe?

116
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:05,420
The Guardian knows that I'm pretending to be a sister.

117
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,420
Of course, you know that I will act.

118
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:12,420
The flower on my neck should be able to determine the location.

119
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,420
So you will come out sooner or later.

120
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,420
You calculated it correctly. I will save you.

121
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,420
I calculated it correctly.

122
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,420
The Guardian is testing me.

123
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,420
To see how bold I am.

124
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,420
To see if I have any value to you.

125
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,420
Value?

126
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,420
You are really something.

127
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:34,420
Cui Qin Xiang was used by you so well.

128
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:37,420
What are you calculating?

129
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:43,420
As you can see, that huge weapon is to save Jialan.

130
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:46,420
Once Jialan is saved, the Guardian will punish you.

131
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,420
Then you will no longer exist.

132
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,420
There are many spies in Biluo City.

133
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,420
Although you have changed the memory of the Night Abyss,

134
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:57,420
the thing that you left me behind will come to me sooner or later.

135
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:00,420
Instead of retreating, it's better to attack.

136
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:03,420
Take me to see Jiuhuo.

137
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,420
We will act together.

138
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,420
Wang Quan Hongye.

139
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:26,420
Shouldn't he be in the Sky Mountain?

140
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:29,420
I wanted to keep him by my side.

141
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:32,420
So I decided to bring him out.

142
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:35,420
How did he wake up?

143
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:38,420
Lord Jiuhuo is asking me.

144
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:41,420
I don't know how he woke up.

145
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,420
It doesn't matter.

146
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,420
I want to see

147
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:49,420
how dangerous his life is.

148
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,420
Left Guardian!

149
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:59,420
Lord Jiuhuo, he can't die now.

150
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,420
What?

151
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,420
You are moved?

152
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,420
A toy is a toy.

153
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:20,420
But it must be in the right place.

154
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,420
I heard that

155
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:25,420
the water monster that the right Guardian chased

156
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,420
was kidnapped by those three-eyed humans.

157
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,420
So he doesn't need to find it.

158
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,420
As long as he exchanges his life with Wang Quan Hongye's,

159
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,420
he will definitely be able to get into the palace.

160
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,420
The Left Guardian did this

161
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:43,420
to help us ease our worries.

162
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,420
Of course, he has his own intentions.

163
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,420
Tell me.

164
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:50,420
Lord Jiuhuo will have Jialan to accompany him.

165
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,420
I think it's not too much

166
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:55,420
to keep him by my side.

167
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,420
There are countless men in the world.

168
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:18,420
How can a man like him

169
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:22,420
have a family?

170
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,420
He is smart, interesting,

171
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:31,420
and a brave tiger.

172
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,420
He will keep him by his side

173
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,420
and remove every eye of him.

174
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,420
After he uses it,

175
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:41,420
he will be able to get out of the palace.

176
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,420
He is smart.

177
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,420
After he uses it,

178
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:47,420
he will kill him again.

179
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:50,420
Isn't it interesting?

180
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,420
Okay.

181
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,420
I will trust you this time.

182
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,420
I will give you three days

183
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:01,420
to use Wang Quan Hongye's

184
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:04,420
to get rid of those little bugs.

185
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,420
I will tell the whole city

186
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,420
that in three days,

187
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,420
if you can't see the water monster

188
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,420
and the jade pendant,

189
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:22,420
I will kill Wang Quan Hongye.

190
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:45,420
Young Master, what are you doing?

191
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,420
Aren't you afraid of the sun?

192
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,420
I'll protect you.

193
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,420
I'm not...

194
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,420
Thank you.

195
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:56,420
You are really ungrateful.

196
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,420
I'm sorry.

197
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,420
I'm sorry.

198
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,420
I'm sorry.

199
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,420
I'm sorry.

200
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,420
I'm sorry.

201
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,420
Yu accompany me.

202
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,420
You're really talking well!

203
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,420
You are going all the way,

204
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,420
pretending.

205
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,420
You believe in demons?

206
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:42,420
There are good and evil in human and demon.

207
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,420
Why don't you believe in demons?

208
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:03,420
Miss, what's wrong?

209
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:07,420
I... I want to say...

210
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:12,420
You are the first human who saved me.

211
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,420
What did you say?

212
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,420
I want to say thank you.

213
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:29,420
Mr. Mu, do you want to learn the secret of the Water Tribe?

214
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,420
I don't understand.

215
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:35,420
But they said that after learning,

216
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:39,420
they can become the God of Death and the Light Tribe.

217
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,420
I'm sorry.

218
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:49,420
I forgot that your parents died.

219
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,420
If you don't know how to talk, then don't talk.

220
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,420
Do you want to learn or not?

221
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:04,420
I heard that you can do both.

222
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,420
I'm asking you.

223
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:25,420
Miss, there are gold and silver flowers here.

224
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,420
What a little noodle shop.

225
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,420
For me?

226
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,420
Yes.

227
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,420
I think this flower is very beautiful.

228
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,420
So I give it to you.

229
00:21:56,420 --> 00:22:00,420
How do you know it's us?

230
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,420
The color of your eyes is different.

231
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,420
The one who brought it here is Miss Blue-eyed.

232
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,420
Now it's your red-eyed.

233
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:09,420
Only the color of the eyes is different?

234
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,420
The personality is also different.

235
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:15,420
Miss Cuiyu with blue eyes is gentle and kind.

236
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:20,420
Miss Red-eyed is more like a wild flower.

237
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:23,420
Then who do you like to get along with?

238
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:26,420
Me or her?

239
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,420
I'm just kidding.

240
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,420
Do you have to be so secretive?

241
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,420
Am I that annoying?

242
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:40,420
Besides, only gentle and kind

243
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:44,420
can't live in this world.

244
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,420
Of course not.

245
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,420
Both of you are very good people.

246
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:50,420
So no matter who it is,

247
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:54,420
I don't believe it's you who killed her.

248
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:58,420
Miss, can you tell me what happened?

249
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:01,420
It's a set of paintings.

250
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,420
Don't think I'll give you three colors

251
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,420
and you can open the dye room.

252
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,420
Miss, I don't mean anything else.

253
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:12,420
I just think you should also want to know

254
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,420
what happened.

255
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:17,420
It's natural to kill people.

256
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,420
No.

257
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:21,420
Do you think I should care about what happened?

258
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,420
It's not like that.

259
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:25,420
In my heart, people are the same as demons.

260
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:28,420
Little face, don't think that your theory

261
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:31,420
of right and wrong can be said.

262
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,420
But there is one thing...

263
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:39,420
If you say it again, I'm really going to be angry.

264
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,420
No.

265
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,420
I was wrong.

266
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,420
It's almost done.

267
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,420
Go back.

268
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:12,420
You're not afraid at all.

269
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:17,420
Why don't you answer me?

270
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:22,420
Your Lordship said that I was safe these three days.

271
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,420
Then I can also...

272
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,420
I can also...

273
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,420
I can also...

274
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,420
I can also...

275
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,420
I can also...

276
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,420
I can also...

277
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,420
I can also...

278
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,420
I can also...

279
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,420
continue to torture you.

280
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:44,420
I've seen the sunset like this before.

281
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,420
It's the same as today.

282
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,420
Like your eastern phoenix?

283
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,420
The sunset that day was very fast.

284
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:55,420
I'm not interested in listening to your stories.

285
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,420
Then accompany me to watch for a while.

286
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:03,420
Just take it as a reward for completing the task.

287
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:12,420
I will go home by myself.

288
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,420
and или

289
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,100
in any case

290
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:22,060
We need to base our article out

291
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,800
Di

292
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,600
If you want to

293
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,880
Thanks

294
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,220
akan greens

295
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,180
Surely

296
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,020
Will do

297
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,400
Don't worry

298
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:45,400
It's a good idea for Hongye to help me deal with the wine.

299
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:56,000
This pill can help you recover your power within three days

300
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,200
and open your eyes again.

301
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,920
Thank you, Cuiyu.

302
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,560
But if I recover my power,

303
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,920
will you still insist on leaving?

304
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:07,680
Actually, I have something to ask you.

305
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:10,760
Go ahead.

306
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,560
Did you open your eyes

307
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,040
to the power of the wine a few days ago?

308
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:17,840
Yes.

309
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,880
Do you know that

310
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,040
it may take at least ten years

311
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,800
to recover your power?

312
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:28,760
I know.

313
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,080
You know but you still insist on doing it?

314
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,040
Why?

315
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,000
Cui was in danger at that time.

316
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,240
If I didn't do that,

317
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,920
I might have lost him.

318
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,880
You can't rest in peace.

319
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,640
If you get hurt,

320
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,000
you will die.

321
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,720
My life,

322
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,680
Cui's life,

323
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,640
there's nothing to hesitate.

324
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,520
I choose him.

325
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:58,880
Why?

326
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,680
You humans are short-lived.

327
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,080
Why do you care about others' lives

328
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,320
more than yours?

329
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,440
Cuiyu,

330
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,720
there are many things

331
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,000
in this world

332
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,040
that have no reason.

333
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:47,360
The wind blows the sky into the wind.

334
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,680
Don't turn back and keep going.

335
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,480
The wind blows the sky into the wind.

336
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,960
Passing through the night,

337
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,320
whose love?

338
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,360
You care about me

339
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,520
more than yourself.

340
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,840
Yitang,

341
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,800
is this your heart?

342
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,840
You love her?

343
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:13,880
Right.

344
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,280
What do you want to squire?

345
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,360
The engagement.

346
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,120
It's very late.

347
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,640
Which engagement?

348
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,280
The engagement between men.

349
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:33,960
Are they pretty?

350
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,000
Do you like it?

351
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,480
Ready to marry?

352
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,480
Do you like it?

353
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,920
Do you like it?

354
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,080
So what if I like it?

355
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,680
So what if I don't?

356
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,680
You're so interesting today.

357
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,720
It's a pity that I don't have time to play with you.

358
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,760
What are you going to do?

359
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,840
I'm going to ask for your advice.

360
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,960
The food is always in red when the wine is served.

361
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,920
Otherwise, why should I dress like this?

362
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,480
No.

363
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,680
I can control the night abyss and the wine.

364
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,600
I don't like to wait.

365
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,720
The power of the wine is not as strong as the night abyss.

366
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,320
The master of the wine is very weak.

367
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,200
Huai Zhu, you can't go.

368
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,200
The wine...

369
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,800
You...

370
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,120
Huai Zhu, the wine is a divine medicine.

371
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,120
Don't do anything stupid.

372
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,400
Huai Zhu!

373
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,000
Huai Zhu!

374
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,280
Sir Ye Yuan, I have the rapidement access to Shihang Temple.

375
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,920
Come over.

376
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,160
I as a demon threaten you.

377
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,720
But your still don't want to2015 journalist I am.

378
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,880
Viai, let's go.

379
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,760
Come on.

380
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,240
Miss Ye Yuan.

381
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:41,240
I asked you to come here. Why didn't you come?

382
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:49,240
I heard that none of the women who served Lord Jiuhuo could be spared.

383
00:30:53,240 --> 00:31:01,240
Don't worry. If you die for me, I will definitely remember your face.

384
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:11,240
I can't.

385
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:14,240
Lord Jiuhuo is indeed a heavenly demon.

386
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,240
You can still survive in such a weak condition.

387
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:21,240
But your energy is wasted.

388
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,240
Tell me.

389
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,240
Who am I?

390
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,240
You were found by me 20 years ago.

391
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:45,240
The mountain fire and the mountain village. The east is in danger.

392
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:50,240
What he said is true.

393
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,240
Why did you bring me here?

394
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,240
Why do I have the black fox's tail?

395
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,240
I will tell you all the truth.

396
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:07,240
You are the weapon that your mother, Jiang Juanxue, used to give me.

397
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:12,240
When I lost my body and became a black fox,

398
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:18,240
what your mother, Jiang Juanxue, did was to find a new body for me.

399
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,240
That is you, Dongfang Huaizhu.

400
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,240
Dongfang Huaizhu?

401
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,240
So you are the fool who was betrayed by your mother.

402
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:41,240
When the circle is broken, the black fox will come back to me.

403
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:46,240
Your Jialan will come back and I will disappear.

404
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,240
You want Jialan.

405
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,240
Wang Quan Hongye wants Dongfang Huaizhu.

406
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:04,240
Since no one chose me, I won't let you go.

407
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,240
Tell me, what is in your hand?

408
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,240
Dragon bone and dragon blood.

409
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:14,240
The star of the Wang Quan clan is the dragon clan.

410
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:35,240
I think I have forgotten something in the internet market today.

411
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,240
The left guard is wearing red clothes today.

412
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,240
Yes, since he came back from the Xuan Gong Mountain,

413
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,240
he doesn't like to wear black clothes.

414
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,240
Good morning, Miss.

415
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:35,240
Mr. Mu, why are you here?

416
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,240
Mr. Mu, I'm leaving.

417
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,240
I know I'm weak and can't help you.

418
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,240
I made this seal myself.

419
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:49,240
It can help to relieve the poison and cool the wind.

420
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:52,240
You are with me and I have no time to waste.

421
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:56,240
May the heaven and earth be happy and may you take care of yourself.

422
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,240
I'm sorry for being rude and rude.

423
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,240
I was rude yesterday. I'm sorry.

424
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,240
And...

425
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,240
This is for you.

426
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:19,240
I can't sleep after I came back from the mansion last night.

427
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:24,240
So I went to pick flowers and made another one this morning.

428
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,240
Thank you.

429
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,240
Then...

430
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,240
Miss, take care.

431
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,240
Here.

432
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:50,240
This ein a for you.

433
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,240
Why did you come back like that?

434
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,240
You répondre hat.

435
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:12,240
I just want to say that I must take care of you.

436
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,240
But I've changed a bit.

437
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,240
He is too kind.

438
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,240
He said he couldn't like demons.

439
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,240
How could he know if he didn't try?

440
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,240
Little Cucumber.

441
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,240
What is Jin Ru Yi?

442
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,240
I'm willing to.

443
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,240
Good morning.

444
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,240
Should we exchange information?

445
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,240
You go first.

446
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:01,240
Jiuhuo told me that I'm really the owner of Dongfang.

447
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:07,240
I'm really the container he prepared for Jialan.

448
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,240
I'm the owner of Dongfang.

449
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,240
The container he prepared for Jialan.

450
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,240
I don't have any information that you don't know.

451
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,240
But I can contact Yang Yitan.

452
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,240
If we want to break the game, we need outsiders.

453
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,240
Jiuhuo controls everything.

454
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,240
You can't leave Biluo City.

455
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,240
You can.

456
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,240
Jiuhuo.

457
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,240
Jiuhuo.

458
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,240
Jiuhuo.

459
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,240
The End

460
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,240
End
