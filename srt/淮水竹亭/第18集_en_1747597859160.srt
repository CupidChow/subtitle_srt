Love is like a wildfire

3
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:11,600
The clouds are like the wind, the sky is like the earth

4
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,640
Don't look back, keep going, life and death are in front of you

5
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:25,000
From the fire to the fire, whose love will last forever?

6
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,040
Don't look back, keep going, life and death are in front of you

7
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:35,800
From the fire to the fire, whose love will last forever?

Episode 9

12
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,960
untie my knot

13
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,080
It's not special at all.

14
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,880
Zun chats to herself,

15
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,340
shows her the rightful place by saying

16
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,460
he doesn't inspire her with words like that.

17
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,680
She finally realizes

18
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,920
she makes her men don't tell her the truth.

19
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,360
I knew this person

20
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,880
must be someone

21
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,680
's boss.

22
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,380
I also knew

23
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,360
he must be someone

24
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,860
I've never had the courage to get involved with you.

25
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:30,720
I'm sorry.

26
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,080
But I can't let you go.

27
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,960
You can't be like this.

28
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,960
Let's go.

29
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,960
No.

30
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,960
No.

31
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,080
Let's go.

32
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,080
No.

33
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,080
Let's go.

34
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,080
Go.

35
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,080
Go.

36
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,080
Go.

37
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,080
Let's go.

38
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,080
Go.

39
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,080
Go.

40
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,080
Go.

41
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,080
Go.

42
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,080
Go.

00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,080
Go.

48
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,080
Go.

49
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,080
Go.

50
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,080
Go.

51
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,360
Jing Chen Xi.

52
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,160
Jiuhuo.

53
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,800
Jing Chen Xi.

54
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,680
You've repaired Jing Chen Xi?

55
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,120
Life is full of surprises.

56
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:21,320
Jing Chen Xi has fallen into my hands.

57
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,680
Jing Chen Xi has fallen into my hands.

58
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,280
I've lost my hope.

59
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,200
But I never thought

60
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,080
that Heaven will help me.

61
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,280
What are you afraid of?

62
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:57,360
The

63
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,840
anxieties of right now

64
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,960
are all gone.

65
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,520
Can we stop it?

66
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,240
Call Y Fern broken-arch to lead us and find her.

67
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,600
Here is your kingdom.

68
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:48,940
The

69
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:53,940
He is the evil spirit we met outside the circle.

70
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:56,940
Black Tiger.

71
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,940
Lord Jiuhuo, you've worked hard.

72
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:04,940
Jia'er.

73
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:10,940
Unite together!

74
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,940
I'm not afraid of you.

75
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:15,940
I'm not afraid of you.

76
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:16,940
Unite together!

77
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,940
Unite together?

78
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,940
I hate this trick the most.

79
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:31,940
Qi Chong!

80
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,940
My soul-suppressing weapon is here.

81
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,940
It's not a weapon.

82
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,940
It's the Eastern Huai Tribe.

83
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:56,940
You're right.

84
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,940
You can make your own decisions.

85
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:16,940
Yuzhu.

86
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:27,940
Brother.

87
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:29,940
Leave!

88
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,940
My brother is a demon.

89
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,940
He's a demon.

90
00:07:41,940 --> 00:08:02,160
My brother is a lunatic who likes to play the

91
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,940
Qi Chong!

92
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,940
Can the result be changed?

93
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:46,940
I, Li Juzhuo,

94
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,940
am now with all the masked group brothers.

95
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,940
I'm here to save the world.

96
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,940
I'm here to save the world.

97
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,940
I'm here to save the world.

98
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,940
I'm here to save the world.

99
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,940
I'm here to save the world.

100
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,940
I'm here to save the world.

101
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:13,940
The masked group brothers are together.

102
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:28,940
They're back.

103
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:32,940
Sister.

104
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:33,940
Cui.

105
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,940
Cui.

106
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:35,940
Cui.

107
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:36,940
Cui, are you okay?

108
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:37,940
I'm fine.

109
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:38,940
How are you?

110
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:39,940
Are you okay, sister?

111
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:40,940
Brother.

112
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:41,940
Brother.

113
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,940
Brother.

114
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:53,940
Zhu.

115
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:55,940
Father.

116
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:00,940
My Zhu.

117
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,940
It's good that you're home.

118
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:05,940
With me here,

119
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:06,940
you'll be fine.

120
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,940
Young Master Wang Quan will be fine.

121
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,940
I didn't expect that you were so strong

122
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:21,940
when you were young.

123
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:23,940
Good.

124
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,940
I'm relieved that you're fine.

125
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:36,940
Oh.

126
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,940
Sister Cui.

127
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,940
This room is the best.

128
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,940
You can live here.

129
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,940
Young Master Yang will live across the street.

130
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,940
I think you have a lot to talk about.

131
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:51,940
I won't bother you.

132
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:53,940
Thank you.

133
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,940
This treatment is really good.

134
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,940
I've been under the pressure of this little girl these days

135
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,940
to repair all the magic weapons of their mountain villa.

136
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:07,940
Li Qu Zhuo.

137
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:09,940
Stand up for me.

138
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:11,940
What?

139
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:19,940
I...

140
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:20,940
You...

141
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:21,940
You...

142
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,940
You...

143
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:23,940
You're Zuo Sheng.

144
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,940
It's really great

145
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,940
to see you when I come back.

146
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,940
From now on,

147
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,940
I won't bully you anymore.

148
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:33,940
I'll be good to you

149
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,940
thousands of times.

150
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:38,940
You're

151
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,940
changing your mind.

152
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:44,940
Come on.

153
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:46,940
Call me Brother Yan.

154
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:50,940
Brother Yan.

155
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:51,940
Come on.

156
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:52,940
Brother Yan.

157
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:55,940
Brother Yan.

158
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:58,940
Tell me. What do you want?

159
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,940
I'll find out all the ways

160
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,940
to help you.

161
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:04,940
I want you to be fine.

162
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:08,940
And everyone

163
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:10,940
should live well.

164
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:14,940
I...

165
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:19,940
Something terrible happened

166
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,940
twenty years later, right?

167
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:27,940
So,

168
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,940
the battle of Ren Yao in twenty years

169
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,940
caused the death of

170
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,940
Yiqi Alliance, Xiao Wang, and the Masked Company.

171
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:34,940
It was a severe loss.

172
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,940
And I

173
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,940
was the one who lived the longest.

174
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:42,940
You came back

175
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,940
to ask me to sacrifice myself?

176
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:51,940
Then I'll be a handsome man

177
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,940
even if I'm old.

178
00:12:58,940 --> 00:12:59,940
What?

179
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:00,940
You're back.

180
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,940
It means the ending will change.

181
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:03,940
Don't be so sad.

182
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,940
Next.

183
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:09,940
You're right.

184
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,940
Since we're back,

185
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:12,940
there must be a chance.

186
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:14,940
Right.

187
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:15,940
I have something to discuss with you.

188
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:17,940
This weapon

189
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,940
needs a lot of energy

190
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,940
to be made and opened.

191
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:23,940
This Golden Lotus Weapon

192
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:24,940
has basically been used up.

193
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,940
But if I carefully repair it,

194
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:28,940
it may still be restored.

195
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:29,940
It must be destroyed.

196
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:32,940
Is it possible

197
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:34,940
for the wine store

198
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,940
to produce the same thing?

199
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:37,940
That's impossible.

200
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:38,940
Xiao Qing can't even see it.

201
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:39,940
But every part of it

202
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:40,940
is a rare treasure.

203
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:42,940
That's good.

204
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,940
So we must destroy it

205
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:46,940
and cut off the possibility

206
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:47,940
of the wine store and the Black Lake

207
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:48,940
coming to our world.

208
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:58,940
If there's a person

209
00:13:58,940 --> 00:13:59,940
who has to die among us,

210
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:01,940
that person won't be you.

211
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:03,940
He's not Rong Xin.

212
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:05,940
He's Dongfang Huai Zhu.

213
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:08,940
In order to save me,

214
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,940
how could you do this?

215
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:14,940
I'm sorry.

216
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:16,940
I'm sorry.

217
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,940
I'm sorry.

218
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:20,940
I'm sorry.

219
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:22,940
I'm sorry.

220
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:24,940
I'm sorry.

221
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:26,940
I'm sorry.

222
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:29,940
I've never thought about this.

223
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:31,940
Then what have you thought about?

224
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:33,940
I can't lose you.

225
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:44,940
Senior.

226
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:46,940
Master asked me to tell you

227
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:47,940
that Young Master is fine.

228
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:48,940
He asked you to rest assured.

229
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:49,940
I'll go and have a look.

230
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:52,940
Junior.

231
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,940
When did you and Wang Quan

232
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:56,940
meet?

233
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:00,940
I'm a senior.

234
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:02,940
I didn't know.

235
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,940
Don't worry about me.

236
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,940
You're fond of Wang Quan Hongye.

237
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,940
Isn't it because he's the young master of Wang Quan?

238
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:21,940
One day,

239
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:22,940
one day,

240
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:24,940
I, Jin Ren Fang,

241
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,940
will trample him to the ground.

242
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:53,940
Yitan.

243
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,940
Are you still thinking about Mu Mian?

244
00:15:58,940 --> 00:15:59,940
The dark fox is breaking the circle.

245
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:01,940
The eternal night is coming.

246
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,940
I don't know what Mu Mian will do.

247
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,940
Mu Mian is very similar to Yitan.

248
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:14,940
I believe

249
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,940
he won't give up hope.

250
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:18,940
Besides,

251
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,940
as long as we change,

252
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:21,940
as long as we change the future,

253
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:24,940
he will be fine.

254
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:34,940
Of course.

255
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:35,940
If you really miss him,

256
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,940
when Aunt Yang Yan gives birth to him,

257
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:39,940
we'll go to see him together.

258
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,940
How about it?

259
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:44,940
Mu Mian did say

260
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:46,940
that when he was six years old,

261
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,940
there was a man with a mask

262
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:50,940
who taught him to open the eyes of the heavens.

263
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,940
But Ling said

264
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,940
that two years later,

265
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,940
we were all dead.

266
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:00,940
Then who is the man

267
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:04,940
with the mask who taught Mu Mian magic?

268
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,940
Enough.

269
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:06,940
I don't need you to say the word dead.

270
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:08,940
Xiaomei,

271
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:10,940
you will live a long life.

272
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,940
Yitan will live a long life, too.

273
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:20,940
Because

274
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,940
I will never be separated from you.

275
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:31,940
Okay.

276
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:39,940
Then

277
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:44,940
if I marry someone else,

278
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,940
will you do the same?

279
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,940
Will you keep it so lonely?

280
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:54,940
I will.

281
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:06,940
Yitan,

282
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,940
your answer is good.

283
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,940
But it's not what I want.

284
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:17,940
Yitan,

285
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:19,940
I'm sorry.

286
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:21,940
I'm sorry.

287
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:23,940
I'm sorry.

288
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:29,940
Jinlian,

289
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:32,940
you really burnt your clothes?

290
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:34,940
Yes.

291
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:35,940
Don't worry.

292
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:36,940
I burnt them all.

293
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,940
You're too cruel.

294
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:40,940
Such a precious weapon.

295
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,940
How can you blame a good minister

296
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:43,940
for giving me a big funeral?

297
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:45,940
Right.

298
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:46,940
I will be careful next time.

299
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:47,940
I...

300
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:55,940
What's wrong?

301
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:56,940
Nothing.

302
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,940
You're talking nonsense.

303
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,940
Tell me who bullied you.

304
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,940
I'll vent my anger on you.

305
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:03,940
Tell me who bullied you.

306
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:15,940
Is it

307
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,940
the man from the God Fire Manor?

308
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:18,940
The one with the glasses

309
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:19,940
and the gold bracelet, right?

310
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:21,940
No.

311
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,940
It has nothing to do with the man from the God Fire Manor.

312
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:26,940
Who is that?

313
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:30,940
Yitan.

314
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,940
I knew it.

315
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,940
It must be because of the baby.

316
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,940
You're so annoying.

317
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:40,940
Right?

318
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,940
Don't worry.

319
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,940
I'll tell you the truth now.

320
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:44,940
I'll make sure

321
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:45,940
that guy

322
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:46,940
writes you a marriage proposal.

323
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:47,940
Once he's done,

324
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,940
I'll send him to the God Manor.

325
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,940
You won't be here by then.

326
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,940
You'll be free now.

327
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:58,940
I'll wait for you.

328
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:04,940
Don't worry, Yitan.

329
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,940
I'll keep you in my heart.

330
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:07,940
I promise.

331
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:08,940
Really?

332
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:14,940
What do you mean?

333
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:16,940
What do you think

334
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:17,940
your eyes are looking at?

335
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,940
Can't you see it?

336
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,940
After Yitan came back from the God's Wall,

337
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:22,940
Yitan's eyes

338
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:23,940
are different.

339
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:25,940
She's already

340
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:28,940
a girl who's just started to fall in love.

341
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:30,940
She...

342
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:32,940
She...

343
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:36,940
You've already

344
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:37,940
fallen for that guy, right?

345
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:43,940
You!

346
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,940
Can't you control yourself?

347
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,940
He doesn't know how to break glass, does he?

348
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:01,940
And he's given up on you.

349
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:03,940
You're still fine!

350
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:06,940
What do you think?

351
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:07,940
I'm fine.

352
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:08,940
You're fine?

353
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:09,940
I'm fine.

354
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:11,940
You're fine?

355
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:16,940
I'm fine.

356
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:17,940
I'm fine.

357
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:19,940
I'm fine.

358
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:21,940
I'm fine.

359
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:23,940
I'm fine.

360
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:25,940
I'm fine.

361
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,940
I'm fine.

362
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:28,940
I'm fine.

363
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:29,940
I'm fine.

364
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,880
My prejudice was bad.

365
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,540
And today,

366
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,120
I chose to come.

367
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,760
People are tired.

368
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,980
The relationship between us is not fine.

369
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,960
You took care of me all along.

370
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,180
Nothing serious.

371
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:49,940
Not bad.

372
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,720
Thank you.

373
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:01,740
That's good.

374
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,900
What did you dream about?

375
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,820
Every year on your death day,

376
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,620
he would bring the letter

377
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,020
to your coffin.

378
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,660
Not many letters.

379
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,580
Because

380
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,740
ten years after you were executed,

381
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,180
he was dead.

382
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:50,380
Into the Visit,

383
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,940
Willow is true to the love love.

384
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,780
It was lonely.

385
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,700
Everything is meaningless,

386
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:00,780
I'm sorry.

387
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:03,860
My wound hurts.

388
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,060
My Lady,

389
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,940
when Young Master Wang Quan wakes up,

390
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,300
Master will ask him to go there.

391
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,820
Okay, I got it.

392
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,820
Your father wants to see me?

393
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,580
I have to go.

394
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,380
Are you going there like this?

395
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:27,940
Okay.

396
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,300
Tell my father not to be nervous.

397
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:32,500
Relax.

398
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:43,620
I'm not nervous.

399
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,180
Come on.

400
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,460
Here are the dishes.

401
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,380
Come on.

402
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,460
Father, have some chicken feet.

403
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,060
Lan'er,

404
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,860
go back to your room and rest.

405
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,780
Young Master Wang Quan and I

406
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,260
want to talk to you.

407
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,500
He's not your son-in-law.

408
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,260
You don't have to explain it to him.

409
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:16,740
I'll sit here

410
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:17,980
and serve you wine.

411
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:30,140
We're both sitting here

412
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,860
and feeling uncomfortable.

413
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,460
Why don't we change our position?

414
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:36,620
Okay.

415
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,340
I have a fever.

416
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,380
I can't drink.

417
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,620
You can drink it yourself.

418
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:48,580
Okay.

419
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,260
Cheers.

420
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,660
We South Chinese

421
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,860
drink vinegar when we eat food.

422
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,740
You're drinking vinegar.

423
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,020
Taste VS Taste

424
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:23,980
We are

425
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,500
life-changing.

426
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:45,540
Young Master, are you a real man

427
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:48,140
or a real gentleman?

428
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:49,860
Well...

429
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,860
It's up to you, Senior Dong Fang.

430
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:56,900
I'm fine with both.

431
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,420
I heard that you are a ruthless and ruthless character

432
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:04,020
who is good at killing and killing.

433
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,260
I don't like ruthless characters.

434
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:11,180
You are destined to be the best in the world.

435
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:13,500
That's why

436
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,260
you can't make snacks or make fish soup.

437
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:19,100
You can't take care of my A'Zhu.

438
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,820
I can learn.

439
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,380
You know what I mean.

440
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:28,780
My A'Zhu doesn't like to fight for power.

441
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:33,340
And you are the center of the dark nest.

442
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:52,600
The

443
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,740
I'mуль,

444
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,660
We've got a new destiny.

445
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,180
and a cup of wine.

446
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:10,140
Yes.

447
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,020
Sir.

448
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,740
I like your smile.

449
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,700
Don't be like a lion at our door.

450
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,180
Come on, relax.

451
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,460
Let's have a good drink.

452
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,300
Yes, yes, yes.

453
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,060
Thank you, sir.

454
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:36,380
Come on.

455
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,460
Cheers.

456
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:44,060
Don't hurt me.

457
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,820
If anyone asks for a marriage,

458
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,140
I'll tell them

459
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:56,460
my son has a good wife.

460
00:27:59,340 --> 00:27:59,940
Jiang Yi.

461
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:01,660
Cheers.

462
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,020
Jiang Yi.

463
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:03,780
Money?

464
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,180
Money?

465
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:06,660
Call me brother.

466
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:08,700
Brother.

467
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:12,980
Brother.

468
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,620
We have everything at home.

469
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,660
But wine is not enough.

470
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:20,460
Brother.

471
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,660
I have wine.

472
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,220
I'll find someone to get it for you.

473
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,420
Get it.

474
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:27,700
Brother.

475
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:28,260
Jiang Yi.

476
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,500
You've heard

477
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,260
what I taught you.

478
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:34,860
You look down on me.

479
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,420
Do I?

480
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:37,420
Show me.

481
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:38,460
Show me.

482
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,260
Show me.

483
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:39,780
Show me.

484
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:41,460
Show me.

485
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,700
Ah Zhu likes to eat

486
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:50,940
steamed lamb cake, steamed ginseng, steamed deer's eye,

487
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,780
roasted duck, roasted pork, roasted goose,

488
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:56,260
braised duck, roasted chicken, spicy pork,

489
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:56,900
and steamed pork.

490
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,340
Who said I like these?

491
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,340
Who said that?

492
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,820
I think I'm drunk.

493
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:04,940
Is it because of Huai Zhu?

494
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,580
I saw it.

495
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:08,900
First,

496
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:12,500
who allowed you to drink?

497
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,300
Who allowed it?

498
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:16,500
Second,

499
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,140
you can drink.

500
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:19,780
Why did you drink vinegar?

501
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,380
That's vinegar.

502
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,500
It's not vinegar.

503
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,300
Vinegar...

504
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,380
Who said

505
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,220
the wine from the mountain of fire is bad?

506
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:27,940
Who said it?

507
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:29,500
I did.

508
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:30,860
Take it away.

509
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,060
Take it away.

510
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,740
We haven't had enough.

511
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,260
We haven't had enough.

512
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,260
Get me some wine.

513
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:38,740
Wine is important.

514
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,380
I'll ask Huai Zhu to get it for you.

515
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:40,900
Get it.

516
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,380
Get it.

517
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,740
Huai Zhu, get the wine.

518
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,660
I'll get it now.

519
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:45,060
Guards.

520
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,020
Miss.

521
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,620
Give them some vinegar

522
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,700
and let them sober up.

523
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,260
Yes.

524
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,340
Come on, brother.

525
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,060
That won't do.

526
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,220
Take it.

527
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,140
Here.

528
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:56,500
Brother.

529
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:57,740
Drink.

530
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,260
You're awake.

531
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:23,740
You...

532
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,300
Huai Zhu, I...

533
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:35,300
I...

534
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:36,940
My throat...

535
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:42,460
You don't just like wine.

536
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,620
You also like vinegar.

537
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,060
Vinegar...

538
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:47,860
You don't remember?

539
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,140
Let me help you recall it.

540
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,940
You didn't just say the name of the dish

541
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,580
but also said my father's dish was too bland.

542
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,700
You even bowed to my father.

543
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,020
So I should call you...

544
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:06,820
That's enough.

545
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:09,180
That's enough.

546
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,620
Drink the soup and go back.

547
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:21,780
I'll go.

548
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,580
Are you angry?

549
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,820
Vinegar isn't expensive.

550
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:29,900
Why should I be angry?

551
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:33,260
And you slept well last night.

552
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,980
Your internal organs are smooth.

553
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,060
Then...

554
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:40,140
Don't you have something important to do?

555
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,820
The medicine in it can help you with two pills a day.

556
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,340
It can help you for seven days.

557
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:45,660
After seven days...

558
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,620
I'll go myself.

559
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:54,540
Sister.

560
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,380
Did Young Master Wang Quan and the others leave?

561
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,220
They all left.

562
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:58,780
That's great.

563
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,460
They're finally close.

564
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,700
I thought they'd leave

565
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,980
because they're close to me.

566
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,020
But they're not.

567
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:04,740
They're not.

568
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,420
They're not.

569
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,180
They're not.

570
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:06,780
They're not.

571
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:07,580
They're not.

572
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:08,340
They're not.

573
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,100
They're not.

574
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,060
I thought they'd stay in the manor

575
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:11,860
and pester you.

576
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,580
They have something important to do.

577
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:15,540
What?

578
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,100
You seem to hate him.

579
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,260
I don't hate him.

580
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,580
I just like Brother-in-law Mian Ji more.

581
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:23,820
Did you remember?

582
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,620
Where are you going to collect the medicine?

583
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,340
Miss.

584
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:29,180
We're going to Cang Yun Mountain today.

585
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,140
What's wrong, Sister?

586
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,980
Cang Yun Mountain is full of cliff cliffs.

587
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,260
They went to collect the medicine

588
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,100
but didn't bring any climbing tools.

589
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,980
It makes sense

590
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,180
when you put it that way.

591
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,420
Qing Lan.

592
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,300
These days, I've been away.

593
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,180
Have the rare plants and plants

594
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,380
in the manor

595
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,460
become more and more?

596
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,420
I've been away for a long time.

597
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,180
I've been away for a long time.

598
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,180
I've been away for a long time.

599
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,180
I've been away for a long time.

600
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,180
I've been away for a long time.

601
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,380
Have they become more and more?

602
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,340
The income of the manor

603
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,660
has increased a lot.

604
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:07,700
That's strange.

605
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:08,740
Qing Lan.

606
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:09,900
Go and summon all the disciples.

607
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:10,580
I want to ask them.

608
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:11,100
Okay.

609
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,860
This Wang Quan Sword is newly made.

610
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,620
Master, please test it.

611
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,060
It's a pity.

612
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,780
The test is always a test.

613
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,100
It can't be the best sword in the world.

614
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:24,340
Uncle Fei.

615
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,460
Do you remember the dream I had?

616
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,860
The so-called Yongye is the Black Tiger.

617
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,460
I guessed my father must have found something

618
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,660
outside the circle.

619
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:32,940
But he couldn't come back.

620
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,460
He could only wait for the right time.

621
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,900
You mean

622
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,420
he's going to the outside circle?

623
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:40,860
Don't worry, Uncle Fei.

624
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:42,900
After the battle in Biluocheng,

625
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,700
I've seen the power of the Black Tiger.

626
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,140
I won't act rashly.

627
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,660
I will find the weakness of the Black Tiger

628
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,540
and find my father

629
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,460
to bring the real Wang Quan Sword.

630
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,540
The body of a thousand years old,

631
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,820
the iron skin of a stone fox,

632
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:00,860
and the body of a golden grass

633
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,500
are all valuable.

634
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:05,220
How did you get these herbs

635
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,260
growing on the cliff?

636
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,260
Of course,

637
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:12,140
we climbed up and got them ourselves.

638
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,780
Show me your hands.

639
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,900
It's rare to find these herbs

640
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,420
in the mountains.

641
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,700
But your hands and feet are clean

642
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:28,100
and your clothes are well-made.

643
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,380
Tell me.

644
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,220
How did you get these herbs?

645
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:33,780
That's right.

646
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:35,460
Tell me now.

647
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,180
Don't force me to tell you.

648
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:45,820
Jin Renfeng,

649
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,820
you enslaved the demons to get herbs.

650
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:51,500
This is a big mistake

651
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,540
that you made in the mountain villa.

652
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,340
Do you know your mistake?

653
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,100
Master,

654
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,580
the world is full of weak and strong people.

655
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,580
We just enslaved a few demons

656
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,580
to get herbs

657
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:02,900
and expand our villa.

658
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,340
What's wrong with that?

659
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,060
The fire and the mountain villa

660
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,020
always treat people and demons the same.

661
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,140
But now, in your eyes,

662
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,700
you only see the strong and the weak.

663
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:19,940
It's not convenient to see the weak.

664
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:21,900
All right.

665
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,900
I'll ask my senior

666
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,740
to see how strong he is.

667
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:28,900
You may leave.

668
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,220
All right.

669
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,740
Let's fight for a while.

670
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,540
Master, please witness it.

671
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:52,820
My sister,

672
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,500
you've Camel didntian.

673
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:52,900
I'm sorry.

674
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:53,900
I'm sorry.

675
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:54,900
I'm sorry.

676
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:55,900
I'm sorry.

677
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:56,900
I'm sorry.

678
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:57,900
I'm sorry.

679
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:58,900
I'm sorry.

680
00:36:58,900 --> 00:36:59,900
I'm sorry.

681
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:00,900
I'm sorry.

682
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:01,900
I'm sorry.

683
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:02,900
I'm sorry.

684
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:03,900
I'm sorry.

685
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:04,900
I'm sorry.

686
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,900
I'm sorry.

687
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:06,900
I'm sorry.

688
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:07,900
I'm sorry.

689
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:08,900
I'm sorry.

690
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:09,900
I'm sorry.

691
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,900
I'm sorry.

692
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:11,900
I'm sorry.

693
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:12,900
I'm sorry.

694
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,900
I'm sorry.

695
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,900
I'm sorry.

696
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:15,900
I'm sorry.

697
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,900
I'm sorry.

698
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:17,900
I'm sorry.

699
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:18,900
I'm sorry.

700
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:19,900
I'm sorry.

701
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:20,900
I'm sorry.

702
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:21,900
I'm sorry.

703
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:22,900
I'm sorry.

704
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:23,900
I'm sorry.

705
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:24,900
I'm sorry.

706
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:25,900
I'm sorry.

707
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:26,900
I'm sorry.

708
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:27,900
I'm sorry.

709
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:28,900
I'm sorry.

710
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:29,900
I'm sorry.

711
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:30,900
I'm sorry.

712
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:31,900
I'm sorry.

713
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:32,900
I'm sorry.

714
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:33,900
I'm sorry.

715
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:34,900
I'm sorry.

716
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:35,900
I'm sorry.

717
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:36,900
I'm sorry.

718
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:37,900
I'm sorry.

719
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:38,900
I'm sorry.

720
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:39,900
I'm sorry.

721
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,900
I'm sorry.

722
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,900
I'm sorry.

723
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:42,900
I'm sorry.

724
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:43,900
I'm sorry.

725
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:44,900
I'm sorry.

726
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:45,900
I'm sorry.

727
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:46,900
I'm sorry.

728
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:47,900
I'm sorry.

729
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:48,900
I'm sorry.

730
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:49,900
I'm sorry.

731
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:50,900
I'm sorry.

732
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:51,900
I'm sorry.

733
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:52,900
I'm sorry.

734
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:53,900
I'm sorry.

735
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:54,900
I'm sorry.

736
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:55,900
I'm sorry.

737
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:56,900
I'm sorry.

738
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:57,900
I'm sorry.

739
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,900
I'm sorry.

740
00:37:58,900 --> 00:37:59,900
I'm sorry.

741
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:00,900
I'm sorry.

742
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:01,900
I'm sorry.

743
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:02,900
I'm sorry.

744
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:03,900
I'm sorry.

745
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:04,900
I'm sorry.

746
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:05,900
I'm sorry.

747
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:06,900
I'm sorry.

748
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:07,900
I'm sorry.

749
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:08,900
I'm sorry.

750
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:09,900
I'm sorry.

751
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:10,900
I'm sorry.

752
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:11,900
I'm sorry.

753
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:12,900
I'm sorry.

754
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,900
I'm sorry.

755
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:14,900
I'm sorry.

756
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:15,900
I'm sorry.

757
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:16,900
I'm sorry.

758
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:17,900
I'm sorry.

759
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:18,900
I'm sorry.

760
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:19,900
I'm sorry.

761
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:20,900
I'm sorry.

762
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:21,900
I'm sorry.

763
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:22,900
I'm sorry.

764
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:23,900
I'm sorry.

765
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:24,900
I'm sorry.

766
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:25,900
I'm sorry.

767
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:26,900
I'm sorry.

768
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,900
I'm sorry.

769
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:28,900
I'm sorry.

770
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:29,900
