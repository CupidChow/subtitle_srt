00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,740
IIIIII IIIIII IIIIII IIII II IIIIII II I don't play

2
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,480
That moon sponsored a drop of white

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,080
Hurry up and turn me into asa

4
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,140
The pain of the human brain

5
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,140
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,140
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,140
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,140
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:30,140
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,140
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,140
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:33,140
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,140
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,140
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,140
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,140
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,140
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,140
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,140
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,140
I'm sorry.

21
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,140
I'm sorry.

22
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,140
I'm sorry.

23
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,140
I'm sorry.

24
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,140
I'm sorry.

25
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:46,140
I'm sorry.

26
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,140
I'm sorry.

27
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,140
I'm sorry.

28
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,140
I'm sorry.

29
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,140
I'm sorry.

30
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,140
I'm sorry.

31
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,140
I'm sorry.

32
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,140
I'm sorry.

33
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,140
I'm sorry.

34
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,140
I'm sorry.

35
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,140
I'm sorry.

36
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,140
I'm sorry.

37
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,140
I'm sorry.

38
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,140
I'm sorry.

39
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,140
I'm sorry.

40
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,140
I'm sorry.

41
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,140
I'm sorry.

42
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,140
I'm sorry.

43
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:04,140
I'm sorry.

44
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,140
I'm sorry.

45
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,140
I'm sorry.

46
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,140
I'm sorry.

47
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,140
I'm sorry.

48
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,140
I'm sorry.

49
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,140
I'm sorry.

50
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,140
I'm sorry.

51
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,140
I'm sorry.

52
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,140
I'm sorry.

53
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,140
I'm sorry.

54
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,140
I'm sorry.

55
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,140
I'm sorry.

56
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,140
I'm sorry.

57
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,140
I'm sorry.

58
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,140
I'm sorry.

59
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,140
I'm sorry.

60
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,140
I'm sorry.

61
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,140
I'm sorry.

62
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,140
I'm sorry.

63
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,140
I'm sorry.

64
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,140
I'm sorry.

65
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,140
I'm sorry.

66
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,140
I'm sorry.

67
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,140
I'm sorry.

68
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,140
I'm sorry.

69
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,140
I'm sorry.

70
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,140
I'm sorry.

71
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,140
I'm sorry.

72
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,140
I'm sorry.

73
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,140
I'm sorry.

74
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,140
I'm sorry.

75
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,140
I'm sorry.

76
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,140
I'm sorry.

77
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,140
I'm sorry.

78
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,140
I'm sorry.

79
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,140
I'm sorry.

80
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,140
I'm sorry.

81
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,140
I'm sorry.

82
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,140
I'm sorry.

83
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,140
I'm sorry.

84
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,140
I'm sorry.

85
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,140
I'm sorry.

86
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,140
I'm sorry.

87
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,140
I'm sorry.

88
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,140
I'm sorry.

89
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,140
I'm sorry.

90
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,140
I'm sorry.

91
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,140
I'm sorry.

92
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,140
Episode 15

93
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,140
Ladies, the yard is ready.

94
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,140
Take a seat.

95
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,140
I'll take you there.

96
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,140
I didn't expect that Miss Dongfang

97
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,140
would come to the Demon Kingdom.

98
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,140
Did you tell her

99
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,140
that you were here to investigate the Black Lake?

100
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,140
She should have guessed it.

101
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,140
But the key to the question is

102
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,140
the first clue I found

103
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,140
is about Miss Dongfang's mother,

104
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,140
Jiang Juanxue.

105
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,140
She is the Saintess of the Northern Mountain Sect.

106
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,140
And the origin of the Northern Mountain Sect and the Black Lake

107
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,140
is closely related.

108
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,140
This is the yard

109
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,140
that you wanted.

110
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,140
It's a little rough.

111
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,140
But it's in a good location.

112
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,140
It's a good view.

113
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,140
Thank you.

114
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,140
The person you're looking for

115
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,140
is a little special.

116
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,140
Please be careful.

117
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,140
Goodbye.

118
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,140
Sister.

119
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,140
I like it here.

120
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,140
It's not bad.

121
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,140
But I didn't expect

122
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,140
that the Crown Prince

123
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,140
would come to the Demon Kingdom.

124
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,140
He just saved us.

125
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,140
I know.

126
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,140
So I'm grateful to them.

127
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,140
And I didn't laugh at them.

128
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,140
Qinglan.

129
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,140
Why don't you ask

130
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,140
why I brought you to the Demon Kingdom?

131
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,140
Why should I ask?

132
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,140
You did the right thing.

133
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,140
Do you believe me?

134
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,140
Of course.

135
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,140
You're the only one

136
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,140
in my heart.

137
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,140
I'll go out for a walk.

138
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,140
I want to get familiar with the environment.

139
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,140
The previous owner of the Dream Tower, Er Zhuyu,

140
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,140
died of assassination a year ago.

141
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,140
He was killed.

142
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,140
The current owner's identity is unknown.

143
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,140
General Xue trained a woman

144
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,140
named Er Zhuyu.

145
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,140
She was the owner of the Dream Tower.

146
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,140
She was?

147
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,140
Yes.

148
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,140
She died a year ago.

149
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,140
After Er Zhuyu died,

150
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,140
something should have stayed in the Dream Tower.

151
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,140
Who is the current owner?

152
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,140
The current owner of the Dream Tower

153
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,140
is very mysterious.

154
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,140
No one knows about it.

155
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,140
I've sent someone to investigate.

156
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,140
We'll get news in a few days.

157
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,140
But now the clues are broken.

158
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,140
Yuyao Valley has closed the city gate.

159
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,140
The current situation

160
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,140
is really unfavorable for us.

161
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:06,140
Who leaked the news to Yuyao Valley?

162
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,140
Useless!

163
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,140
It's been three days since we closed the gate.

164
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,140
We can't even find a shadow.

165
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,140
Can the red leaves of the dead spring

166
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,140
grow wings and fly?

167
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,140
Maybe the news of the dead spring

168
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,140
is fake.

169
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,140
The red leaves of the dead spring

170
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,140
didn't come at all.

171
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,140
Useless!

172
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,140
You're lying.

173
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,140
What good can it do?

174
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,140
Tell Ananyan to come to the palace.

175
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,140
Yes.

176
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,140
Your Majesty.

177
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,140
You don't need to summon me.

178
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,140
I'm here.

179
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,140
Okay.

180
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,140
I've put a lot of effort into it

181
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,140
to make you the State Preceptor.

182
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,140
Why?

183
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,140
Because you told me in person

184
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,140
that you wanted to take the head of the red leaves

185
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,140
to repay me.

186
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,140
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

187
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,140
The people who assassinated the red leaves

188
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,140
have already left.

189
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,140
I'll wait and see.

190
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,140
Step aside!

191
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,140
Step aside!

192
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,140
Step aside!

193
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,140
Step aside!

194
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,140
Step aside!

195
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,140
I'll go down and see.

196
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,140
Wait for me here.

197
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,140
Someone has reported to Ruyi Pavilion

198
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:50,140
that the people who hid the Yiqi Alliance...

199
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,140
Search!

200
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,140
Search every room!

201
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,140
Yes!

202
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,140
Young Master Wang Xuan.

203
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,140
Boss Qingmu told me

204
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,140
to take you out of the back door.

205
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,140
I'll go to the back door.

206
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,140
Yes.

207
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:43,140
The Sword is a fake?

208
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,140
If he was used to assassinate the people

209
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,140
in the previous episode,

210
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,140
no one in the Yiqi Alliance

211
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,140
would be able to resist.

212
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,140
Didn't Fifth Sister

213
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,140
receive any news

214
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,140
about the master

215
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,140
who came to the Demon Kingdom?

216
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,140
Fifth Sister.

217
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,140
I'm here.

218
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,140
I'm here.

219
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,140
I'm here.

220
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,140
I'm here.

221
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,140
I'm here.

222
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,140
I'm sorry.

223
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,140
I was careless.

224
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,140
I don't blame you.

225
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,140
Since my whereabouts have been exposed,

226
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,140
I can't stay in Ruyi Pavilion anymore.

227
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,140
Is it dangerous

228
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,140
for you, Fifth Sister?

229
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,140
Don't worry.

230
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,140
I'll just say that you're my big brother.

231
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,140
Qingmu's family has been doing business

232
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,140
in the Demon Kingdom for so many years.

233
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,140
They still have a way out.

234
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,140
Lingyi should be back soon.

235
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,140
Make another identity card

236
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,140
for us.

237
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,140
The identity card of the Demon Kingdom

238
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,140
is made of stone.

239
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,140
The mine is controlled by the master.

240
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,140
I finally got two pieces

241
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,140
and was used to save people.

242
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,140
Fifth Sister, you

243
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,140
must have a way.

244
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,140
I do have a way.

245
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,140
The demon in Demon Kingdom

246
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,140
is the property of the Demon Master.

247
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,140
No need for an identity card.

248
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,140
You want us to be demons?

249
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,140
If we want to stay in the Demon Kingdom

250
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,140
and investigate,

251
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,140
there's only one way left.

252
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,140
It's not a problem

253
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,140
to make a demon pill

254
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:28,140
for Lingyi.

255
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,140
But who should we be demons for?

256
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,140
What do you think?

257
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:40,140
The Demon Lord

258
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,140
Dongfang Huizhuo.

259
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,140
Do you think you can get away?

260
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,140
I've been integrated with you for a long time.

261
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,140
And now

262
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,140
I'm just being suppressed for the time being.

263
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,140
I'm just being suppressed for the time being.

264
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,140
I'm just being suppressed for the time being.

265
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,140
I'm just being suppressed for the time being.

266
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,140
I'm just being suppressed for the time being.

267
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,140
I'm just being suppressed for the time being.

268
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,140
I'm just being suppressed for the time being.

269
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,140
I'm just being suppressed for the time being.

270
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,140
I'm just being suppressed for the time being.

271
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,140
I'm just being suppressed for the time being.

272
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,140
I'm just being suppressed for the time being.

273
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,140
I'm just being suppressed for the time being.

274
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,140
I'm just being suppressed for the time being.

275
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,140
I'm just being suppressed for the time being.

276
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,140
I'm just being suppressed for the time being.

277
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,140
I'm just being suppressed for the time being.

278
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,140
I'm just being suppressed for the time being.

279
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,140
I'm just being suppressed for the time being.

280
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,140
I'm just being suppressed for the time being.

281
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,140
If he was used in an assassination just now,

282
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,140
no one should be able to hear the whole thing.

283
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,140
Was it you?

284
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,140
I'm sorry.

285
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,140
I'm sorry.

286
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,140
I'm sorry.

287
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,140
I'm sorry.

288
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,140
I'm sorry.

289
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,140
I'm sorry.

290
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,140
I'm sorry.

291
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,140
I'm sorry.

292
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,140
I'm sorry.

293
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,140
I'm sorry.

294
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,140
I'm sorry.

295
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,140
It's okay.

296
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,140
You're hurt.

297
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,140
It's seriously hurt.

298
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,140
It's okay.

299
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:21,140
Why would you live in such a shabby place?

300
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,140
I'm used to it.

301
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,060
I'm used to it.

302
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,100
You're the master of the Zhang family.

303
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,220
Why are you so selfish?

304
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:32,780
Where are you going?

305
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,620
I'm looking for food.

306
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,140
Ran.

307
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,620
Wang Xuanhong is still alive.

308
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,180
I'll find another chance.

309
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,300
Don't call me by that name again.

310
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,220
Dongburn.

311
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,140
D'oussaint-Nua has died.

312
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,420
Please come in.

313
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,500
Please come in.

314
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,300
Please come in.

315
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:19,820
Hey.

316
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,780
Why can they go in?

317
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,820
Why can't we go in?

318
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,420
You don't even know the rules of the Dream House.

319
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,340
What are you doing?

320
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,260
What do you mean?

321
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,380
What rules are there in the Dream House?

322
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,380
If you don't have a substitute,

323
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,020
you're not qualified to participate in the Tear-Demon Competition.

324
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,900
What is the Tear-Demon Competition?

325
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,460
This is the place where the Demon-Python Master

326
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,580
plays the Tear-Demon Competition.

327
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,500
It's good that you know.

328
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,700
If you want to enter the Dream House,

329
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,980
you must participate in the Tear-Demon Competition.

330
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,580
Otherwise, you won't get in.

331
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:57,820
Let's go.

332
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:00,540
I'll go.

333
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:02,540
You two.

334
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,380
Please come in.

335
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,900
It's okay, big sister.

336
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,780
I'll go catch two little demons tomorrow.

337
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,860
Then we can go in.

338
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:11,580
What?

339
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,460
Where did you get the snacks?

340
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,900
Miss Huizhu, you're back.

341
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,340
I'm not a human.

342
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,540
Why don't you say hello to me?

343
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,660
Nice to meet you, Master Qin Lan.

344
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,260
Who is your master?

345
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,060
You're back.

346
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,340
The meal will be ready soon.

347
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,380
So,

348
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,700
you two are here to help us?

349
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,100
Cooperation?

350
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,380
That's called cooperation.

351
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,500
Mind your words.

352
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,980
I don't want to cooperate with you.

353
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,460
Wait, how did you...

354
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,220
Qin Lan.

355
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,700
So you came here

356
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,700
to investigate the Black Tiger, right?

357
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,420
Yes.

358
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,420
But I don't know why

359
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,540
your identity was exposed

360
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,740
and your whereabouts were leaked.

361
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,820
Your brother was assassinated in Ruyi Pavilion.

362
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,260
Did he get hurt?

363
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,140
Don't worry, I'm fine.

364
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,700
Then stay.

365
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,260
There's a care center in Yiqi.

366
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:29,060
Sister, it's not a care center.

367
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,700
It's a care center.

368
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,060
You've said it.

369
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,740
We're here to take care of you.

370
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:35,660
Qi Chu.

371
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:36,500
Well,

372
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,060
Mr. Han.

373
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,380
What's the matter?

374
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,900
we will become the real medicine.

375
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,340
You'd better be a human first.

376
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,740
I'll stop pretending then.

377
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,740
The second son of the Tao Yuan family, Li Qu Zhuo.

378
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,940
Sit down and focus.

379
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,300
Okay, Brother Lei.

380
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:37,740
I can be a demon.

381
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,100
A demon?

382
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,260
Qu Zhuo can be a demon?

383
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,380
That's amazing.

384
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:43,940
Of course.

385
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,060
When Qingmu Yuan sends the Demon King blood,

386
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,020
I can get it out.

387
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,020
We can eat it and become demons.

388
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,300
Then, Sister-in-law, you...

389
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,740
You're so good at this.

390
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,980
I'm not a demon.

391
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,020
I'm a human.

392
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,020
I'm a human.

393
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,020
I'm a human.

394
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,020
I'm a human.

395
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,020
I'm a human.

396
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,340
You...

397
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,860
You...

398
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,220
You...

399
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,220
You...

400
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,700
Your Ladyship.

401
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,260
Your Ladyship, you can wait and see.

402
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:13,660
Okay.

403
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,420
But there's no bedroom.

404
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,740
Where do you live?

405
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,500
We can clean up the woodshed.

406
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:20,540
We'll live in the woodshed.

407
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,100
You clean it up?

408
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,020
I...

409
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,020
I clean it up.

410
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,500
I clean it up.

411
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,620
The recent research of the Demon Kingdom

412
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,300
only found that two bottles of demon blood were used.

413
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,140
One bottle is snake demon,

414
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,220
and the other is dog demon.

415
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,900
Brother, do you know

416
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,660
what will happen if you take the blood of the Demon King?

417
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,780
Don't worry. I have you.

418
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,940
I'll use my brain to separate the demon from the demon.

419
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,420
It won't be a problem.

420
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,500
It's not as simple as you think.

421
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,420
Once you take the blood of the demon,

422
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,980
you can't use your power.

423
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,020
You can only use your power.

424
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,940
And the blood of the demon will also be affected.

425
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,620
Maybe it will become a fatal weakness of you.

426
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,460
Especially the snake demon.

427
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,500
Its biggest weakness is that it is extremely cold.

428
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,300
Once it enters the desert,

429
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,580
it will become extremely fragile.

430
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,420
The demon will be released in ten days.

431
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,420
Don't worry.

432
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,660
Give me the snake demon.

433
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,740
Dog demon, mine.

434
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,060
It smells good.

435
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:24,740
Enough.

436
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,300
I can't control you two.

437
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,460
I'll go back first.

438
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,420
Qu Zhu, this will definitely...

439
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,020
Don't worry.

440
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,300
I won't let sister-in-law know about this.

441
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:40,500
Let's go.

442
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,580
I've already put the blood of the Demon King

443
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,180
that Miss Qingmu sent in.

444
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,860
You're making a fuss.

445
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,620
Isn't it just swallowing the blood of the demon?

446
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,660
What do you know?

447
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,140
I used the gourd to peel off the demon's blood

448
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,420
and then I purified the demon's blood

449
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,540
until it was clear and like a glass.

450
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,820
You won't lose your nature, will you?

451
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,500
Don't worry, Miss Qingmu.

452
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,860
The demon will be released in ten days.

453
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,700
Although we can't use our power,

454
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,460
we can still use the power of the demon.

455
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:15,500
Right.

456
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:16,620
And ten days

457
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,500
is enough for us to complete the task of the Demon Valley.

458
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,500
What is this medicine?

459
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,860
The purple one is snake demon's.

460
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,220
The silver one is dog demon's.

461
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,940
The Demon Lord will be excited after the midnight.

462
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:58,940
By then,

463
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,340
as long as we relax,

464
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,100
there will be no problem.

465
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:02,540
Okay.

466
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,260
Let's wait and see.

467
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,260
In the autumn in the Demon Kingdom,

468
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,340
it's really scary to live in Wen Cha.

469
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,300
Why haven't those two come out yet?

470
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,540
After all, it's the Demon King's season.

471
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,740
It always takes some time.

472
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,340
I'm worried about them.

473
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,180
It always takes some time.

474
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,140
It's obvious that they are low in materiality.

475
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:27,900
We can't use them.

476
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,020
Young Master Li

477
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,020
has finally become a great man.

478
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,220
Li Gou.

479
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,620
It's really you.

480
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:58,620
Sister.

481
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:01,580
It seems that the demon can't make people smarter.

482
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,940
I think Young Master Wang Quan

483
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,540
may not be as good as this little dog.

484
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,660
I'll go and check.

485
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,380
I'll go and check.

486
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:10,900
Okay.

487
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,420
Okay.

488
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:11,820
Okay.

489
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,460
Okay.

490
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,060
Okay.

491
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:13,620
Okay.

492
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,140
Okay.

493
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:14,660
Okay.

494
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,140
Okay.

495
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:15,620
Okay.

496
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,100
Okay.

497
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:16,620
Okay.

498
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,020
Okay.

499
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:17,620
Okay.

500
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:18,140
Okay.

501
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:18,620
Okay.

502
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:19,140
Okay.

503
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:19,620
Okay.

504
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,140
Okay.

505
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,140
Okay.

506
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:21,660
Okay.

507
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,260
Okay.

508
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:22,780
Okay.

509
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:23,820
I'll go and check.

510
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:27,980
Li Gou.

511
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,180
afford me.

512
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,180
I'm puzzle- Ass Doncs.

513
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:23,660
Wu!

514
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,420
Didn't you say it was a monster?

515
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,260
We don't know how to get to it.

516
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,140
He has the spirit of a snake

517
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,340
but he's not fully enjoying it yet.

518
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:45,540
Qinglan, help me carry him shoe.

519
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,180
I don't need to.

520
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,140
Gitong, carry him.

521
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:58,020
Should I say someone who puts outwerws

522
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,140
Yes

523
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,420
Here

524
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,580
Junior Lee

525
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,820
Come out

526
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:26,060
I- I...

527
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,880
ihten-

528
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:39,800
Z ble

529
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,140
Z ble

530
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,180
Z ble

531
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,360
Z ble

532
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,780
I...

533
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,780
Li Gou, Li Gou.

534
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:59,780
How old is this dog that you're still peeing on the bed?

535
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,780
That...

536
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,780
Are you hungry?

537
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,780
Hungry.

538
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,780
Come.

539
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,780
I think the kitchen is just for these things.

540
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,780
I can only make a sour and spicy soup.

541
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,780
Tomorrow, I'll go out and buy some meat.

542
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,780
We'll make pork, meat, and green onion cabbage.

543
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,780
My sister doesn't like pork and meat.

544
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,780
Then let's make green onion and pork.

545
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,780
You...

546
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,780
You dog.

547
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,780
Three pieces. Three pieces will do.

548
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,780
I didn't think you could cook.

549
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,780
Of course not. Our noodles...

550
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,780
I...

551
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,780
I cook with my friends.

552
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,780
Even my brother can only help me.

553
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,780
What is this?

554
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,780
It's so cool.

555
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,780
Okay.

556
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:25,780
Then forgive me for peeing on the bed last night.

557
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,780
I'm a talented person.

558
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,780
I can make a medicine quickly.

559
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,780
Where's my brother? How is he?

560
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,780
What?

561
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,780
Is there something wrong with me?

562
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,780
No.

563
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,780
How did I fall asleep last night?

564
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,780
I don't remember.

565
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:43,780
You didn't sleep at all last night.

566
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:47,780
But your inner heart is still very confused.

567
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,780
I'm sorry.

568
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:52,780
But your inner heart is still very confused.

569
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:54,780
You need to take care of yourself.

570
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,780
You...

571
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,780
I'm going to the pharmacy for a checkup.

572
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,780
I need to get in touch with more people and monsters.

573
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,780
I also need to learn how to find out more information.

574
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,780
I'll go out with you.

575
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,780
I have an appointment with someone today.

576
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,780
You?

577
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:17,780
Don't worry. Once it's over, I'll go to the place for a checkup and find you.

578
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:20,780
Let's go home together.

579
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:25,780
Sister, let's eat!

580
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,780
Let's go.

581
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:39,780
Sister, I'll go with you to the doctor's office later.

582
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,780
I'll go with your sister.

583
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:45,780
You don't even know how to walk. How are you going to go?

584
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,780
I can control myself.

585
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:53,780
Also, Miss Qin Lan,

586
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,780
I have a favor to ask of you.

587
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,780
The demon elixir in Qu Zhuo's body hasn't fully melted yet.

588
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:01,780
You need to take care of and train people.

589
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:04,780
And Miss Qin Lan, you are talented and smart.

590
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:06,780
You have high magical power.

591
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:10,780
The most important thing is that you are kind and patient.

592
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:14,780
I wonder if you can help Qu Zhuo.

593
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:19,780
Help Qu Zhuo?

594
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,780
Yes.

595
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:24,780
Help Qu Zhuo.

596
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,780
But your demon elixir hasn't fully melted yet.

597
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,780
If you go, it's a gamble.

598
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,780
This...

599
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,780
You can control water?

600
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:52,780
I just adjusted my waist a little bit.

601
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,780
I did it.

602
00:27:55,780 --> 00:28:00,780
It seems that the way the demon elixir is made is different.

603
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,780
Then, Qin Lan,

604
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:10,780
what is the effect of Li Shao Zhu's elixir?

605
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:13,780
It's a very strong elixir.

606
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,780
Then, Qin Lan,

607
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:20,780
can you take care of Li Shao Zhu?

608
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,780
Master,

609
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:26,780
I really need your help.

610
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,780
Thank you, Miss Qin Lan.

611
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,780
Uncle Huai, let's go.

612
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,780
My brother just...

613
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,780
Water...

614
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:49,780
That's it?

615
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,780
Brother is really a brother.

616
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,780
A good person always shows his talent.

617
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,780
Then, Mr. Li of the Tao Yuan family,

618
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,780
what is your demon elixir?

619
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,780
I...

620
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,780
My demon elixir...

621
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,780
You are a dog, right?

622
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,780
Damn it.

623
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,780
I have good news for everyone.

624
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,780
Miss Er Zhu said

625
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:19,780
that people and demons can be treated for free.

626
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:20,780
You don't have to be afraid.

627
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,780
You can come in and see the doctor.

628
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:25,780
There really is a free doctor for demons.

629
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,780
Thank you, Miss Er Zhu.

630
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,780
Hurry and go in.

631
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:29,780
Is it true?

632
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:30,780
It's true.

633
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,780
Don't lie to us.

634
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,780
Come in.

635
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:33,780
Come in.

636
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:34,780
Hurry and go in.

637
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,780
Come in.

638
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,780
Come in.

639
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:37,780
Go.

640
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,780
Prince of Bumu,

641
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,780
long time no see.

642
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,780
How are you?

643
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,780
Young Master Wang Quan,

644
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:10,780
you...

645
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,780
Thanks to you, everything is fine.

646
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,780
That's good.

647
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,780
This outfit you are wearing,

648
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:22,780
you must have some kind of mission, right?

649
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:24,780
To be honest,

650
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:27,780
I came here to ask you for a favor.

651
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:31,780
You once gave me a gift in the snow.

652
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,780
I will never forget it.

653
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:34,780
It's okay to say it.

654
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,780
I want to know

655
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,780
what happened to Jiuhuo and Black Tiger

656
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,780
in the Demon Kingdom back then.

657
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:43,780
There is also the Saint of Beishan Sect, Jiang Juan Xue,

658
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,780
the master of the Drunken Dream House he trained.

659
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:48,780
How did Zhu Yu die?

660
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:56,780
This underground palace was once the altar of the Beishan Sect.

661
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,780
Five hundred years ago,

662
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:01,780
the Heaven Demon Jiuhuo was sealed here.

663
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,780
Jiuhuo was sealed by the Beishan Sect.

664
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,780
Why was she sealed?

665
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,780
I don't know the details.

666
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:12,780
Young Master, please come with me to a place.

667
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,780
We have arrived.

668
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:31,780
This is the secret room of the State of the Demon Kingdom.

669
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,780
This is not an ordinary barrier.

670
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:35,780
It's not a barrier that can be broken.

671
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,780
But this barrier

672
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:41,780
was also set by the Beishan Sect during the Ding Sheng period.

673
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,780
It's the Beishan Sect again.

674
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,780
I got news that

675
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,780
the Beishan Sect is related to the origin of Black Tiger.

676
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:49,780
So,

677
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:53,780
there might be something that the Young Master needs here.

678
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:58,780
How can I get in?

679
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:03,780
Only the Chief of the State can enter with the seal.

680
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:08,780
What if I find the Beishan Sect?

681
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,780
The Beishan Sect has been destroyed

682
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,780
after the death of Er Zhu Yu.

683
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,780
Destroyed?

684
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:22,780
Er Zhu Yu was assassinated?

685
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,780
Yes.

686
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:27,780
Did he leave anything behind?

687
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,780
After you said that,

688
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:34,780
it's really strange that he died.

689
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:38,780
Er Zhu Yu was the most fierce Tower Master in his life.

690
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,780
After he died,

691
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,780
the most fierce Tear Demon Festival

692
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:44,780
became more and more frequent.

693
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:46,780
Tear Demon Festival?

694
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,780
It's over.

695
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,780
What is it?

696
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,780
A cake.

697
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:10,780
Did you get anything today?

698
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,780
Not much.

699
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:15,780
They say that the Drunken Dream Tower is a small and quiet place.

700
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:17,780
It's heavily guarded.

701
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:19,780
Except for the Tear Demon Festival,

702
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:22,780
people and people are not allowed to enter.

703
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:25,780
Let's go eat something.

704
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:29,780
Maybe love

705
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:33,780
is blooming in the heart

706
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:36,780
So love

707
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:39,780
is in the heart

708
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:42,780
Did you take the medicine?

709
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,780
What do you think?

710
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:48,780
The love is coming, don't be hasty

711
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:53,780
Just change your heart

712
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:01,780
Don't be afraid to change your mind

713
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:08,780
Just face the love that hides you

714
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,780
I don't want to be loved

715
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:15,780
When the eyes meet

716
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:20,780
We will be sure that we will not

717
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,780
cherish each other

718
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:25,780
Maybe love

719
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:29,780
is blooming in the heart

720
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:32,780
So love

721
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:36,780
is in the heart

722
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:39,780
Maybe love

723
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,780
is in the heart

724
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,780
Your heart is broken.

725
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,780
If we separate,

726
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:48,780
we can still love each other

727
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:51,780
Then each piece is yours.

728
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,780
Shake hands.

729
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:12,780
Shake hands.

730
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,780
Shake hands.

731
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:18,780
You're so good.

732
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,780
Come, congratulations on your promotion.

733
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,780
Congratulations on your promotion.

734
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,780
Congratulations on your promotion.

735
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,780
Qizhu, what are you doing?

736
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:37,780
Sister.

737
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:38,780
Brother.

738
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:43,780
I just want to stimulate his power.

739
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,780
I just tried the fire.

740
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:48,780
I just want to use some primitive methods.

741
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:51,780
Okay, I don't practice.

742
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:52,780
Go to cook.

743
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,780
You've been practicing for a day.

744
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,780
He asked me to cook now.

745
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:02,780
Who told you to meddle in the affairs of the world?

746
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,780
Don't talk nonsense.

747
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,780
Okay, no cooking today.

748
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,780
Huizhu and I

749
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,780
bought your favorite roasted chicken.

750
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:10,780
Roasted chicken?

751
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,780
Give it to me.

752
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:14,780
Give it to me.

753
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:15,780
Li Gong.

754
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:19,780
Li Gong.

755
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:30,780
I found that the fourth brother met his younger sister.

756
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:31,780
It's really a star.

757
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:34,780
They two

758
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:35,780
had a good time.

759
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,780
Do you want to consider

760
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,780
telling him that you are the mask?

761
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:43,780
What I'm worried about is that

762
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:45,780
the mask group is so powerful

763
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,780
that it's the only thing that can't be tolerated.

764
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,780
So I still think that

765
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,780
it's better not to know.

766
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,780
Look at him now.

767
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,780
How nice.

768
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,780
Then wait a little longer.

769
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:03,780
When you think it's right,

770
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:05,780
you can tell me.

771
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:10,780
I found something

772
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:12,780
after coming to the Demon Kingdom.

773
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:15,780
What is it?

774
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:26,780
Black Tiger Demon Cove.

775
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,740
Did the

776
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,780
Internet of Life and Death not evolve?

777
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:40,780
It seems that

778
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,780
it was just temporarily suppressed.

779
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:43,780
The demon core of Black Tiger is still in my body.

780
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:46,780
It may be re-invented at any time.

781
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:53,780
I came here for this.

782
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,780
Actually, my mother left me a clue in the letter.

783
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,780
She asked me to go to the Drunken Dream House

784
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,780
to find someone named Er Zhu Yu.

785
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,780
I must get the West Martial Arts.

786
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,780
Er Zhu Yu was assassinated.

787
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,780
You know that?

788
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,780
When I got the news,

789
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:10,780
Er Zhu Yu and your mother

790
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,780
are from the Northern Mountain Sect.

791
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:13,780
The Northern Mountain Sect

792
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:14,780
is related to the origin of Black Tiger.

793
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,780
But now the Northern Mountain Sect

794
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:18,780
has been destroyed.

795
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:22,780
Black Tiger and Northern Mountain Sect?

796
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:27,780
I also met Prince of Bumu today.

797
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:29,780
He also mentioned

798
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:30,780
the most ridiculous thing you said just now.

799
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:31,780
He said that after Er Zhu Yu died,

800
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,780
the Thunder Demon Competition in the building

801
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:34,780
was held more and more frequently.

802
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,780
It's unusual.

803
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:39,780
It seems that the Drunken Dream House

804
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,780
is the key.

805
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:01,780
The wind blows like a wind,

806
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,780
the clouds stop like a cloud,

807
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:19,620
the

808
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:20,620
sky is clear,

809
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,620
the clouds stop like a cloud,

810
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:22,620
the clouds stop like a cloud,

811
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:23,620
the clouds stop like a cloud,

812
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:24,620
the clouds stop like a cloud,

813
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:25,620
the clouds stop like a cloud,

814
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:26,620
the clouds stop like a cloud,

815
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:27,620
the clouds stop like a cloud,

816
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,620
the clouds stop like a cloud,

817
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:29,620
the clouds stop like a cloud,

818
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:30,620
the clouds stop like a cloud,

819
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:31,620
the clouds stop like a cloud,

820
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,620
the clouds stop like a cloud,

821
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,620
the clouds stop like a cloud,

822
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,620
the clouds stop like a cloud,

823
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,620
the clouds stop like a cloud,

824
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:36,620
the clouds stop like a cloud,

825
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,620
the clouds stop like a cloud,

826
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:38,620
the clouds stop like a cloud,

827
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:39,620
the clouds stop like a cloud,

828
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,620
the clouds stop like a cloud,

829
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,620
the clouds stop like a cloud,

830
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:42,620
the clouds stop like a cloud,

831
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:43,620
the clouds stop like a cloud,

832
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:44,620
the clouds stop like a cloud,

833
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:45,620
the clouds stop like a cloud,

834
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:46,620
the clouds stop like a cloud,

835
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:47,620
the clouds stop like a cloud,

836
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,620
the clouds stop like a cloud,

837
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:49,620
the clouds stop like a cloud,

838
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:50,620
the clouds stop like a cloud,

839
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:51,620
the clouds stop like a cloud,

840
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,620
the clouds stop like a cloud,

841
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:53,620
the clouds stop like a cloud,

842
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,620
The sky is full of stars.

843
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:56,620
I look up and see

844
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:57,620
the years and years.

845
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:58,620
I look at the stars and see the bright stars.

846
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:59,620
I fall in love with you as if we first met.

847
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:00,620
I have so many times to rub my shoulders.

848
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:01,620
I have so many times to rub my shoulders.

849
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:02,620
