Do you understand what to do?

7
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Yes, I will go and catch some people

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Sister, it's still very busy when we came to pick herbs last year

10
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
The whole street is full of people talking

11
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Why is there no one now?

12
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I heard that there are many herbs in this place recently

13
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's not peaceful

14
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
But this inn is still here

15
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Some people are still in the inn

16
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I think it's a good place to go

17
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I think it's a good place to go

18
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I think it's a good place to go

19
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
But this inn is still here

20
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Some people are surprised

21
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You have to be careful

22
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Don't worry

23
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I have my sister's Demon-Slaying Fire

24
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm not afraid of those demons

25
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Demon-Slaying Fire

26
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Why are people from the mountain of fire here?

27
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Boss

28
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Boss, two bowls of rice noodles

29
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Coming

30
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Xiaor

31
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Xiaor

32
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Two bowls of rice noodles

33
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You two drink some tea first

34
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Boss

35
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Is that the Zhenyao Bell hanging on the top?

36
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It seemed to ring just now

37
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's all left by the heroes who used to help me

38
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The heroes who helped me left it

39
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Sometimes it rings

40
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Sometimes it doesn't ring

41
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Where are the people in town?

42
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
When my sister and I came to pick herbs last year

43
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's so lively here

44
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You two don't know

45
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
There are demons in Nan Chui recently

46
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Stole everyone

47
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
The people in town

48
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
All who can run away

49
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
What kind of medicine is this?

50
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
How dare you

51
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's a spider's poison

52
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Then why are you still here?

53
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
If I leave

54
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Where are the heroes of the poison?

55
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Don't worry

56
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
The heroes left me many magic treasures

57
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
My inn is safe

58
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's safe

59
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You are so tough

60
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You just changed your character

61
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You are really not good at tea

62
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Fortunately, I have a plan

63
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Meat

64
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Spot

65
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
B unsere

66
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
lies

67
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
lemma

68
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
That's the real boss!

69
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Jinglan!

70
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Qi Bi, or I'll kill him!

71
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You...

72
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Jingjian!

73
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
How dare you use the Shadow Palm!

74
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Shame on you!

75
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
What a strong sword!

76
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Where am I?

77
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Hello, miss.

78
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
How are you?

79
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
A mask? A sword?

80
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Could he be the legendary Mr. Sword?

81
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Could he be the legendary Mr. Sword?

82
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
The street is full of poisonous things.

83
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'll take the girl to a more open place.

84
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Can you turn around?

85
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Oh.

86
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Should I thank you?

87
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
No need.

88
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
But I have a favor to ask.

89
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Seeing you fight with the enemy,

90
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
you must be Miss Dongfang.

91
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
What do you want?

92
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I want...

93
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It's hard to say.

94
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I don't want to.

95
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'm sorry.

96
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'll take the girl to a more open place.

97
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'll make up for it in the future.

98
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Stop!

99
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Stop right there!

100
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You're here for Nan Chui,

101
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
the evil demon who has taken the people.

102
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Do you know where this demon is?

103
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I know it's in the mountain ahead.

104
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
My sister and I often come here to collect herbs.

105
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
The road is long and the smoke is white.

106
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
She has given me directions.

107
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
She's very accurate.

108
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I think you need my help.

109
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You just cut my hair.

110
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
There must be a way to break the enemy.

111
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
How about our cooperation?

112
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Okay.

113
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
But before I go,

114
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I have to make a deal with you.

115
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
No problem.

116
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
One, you can't do it.

117
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Two, you can't leave me alone.

118
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Three, you can't let go of my sword.

119
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Deal.

120
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
The evil demon has taken the girl!

121
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Help!

122
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Sister?

123
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
This is where they built the Star-picking Tower.

124
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
My sister is here too.

125
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Remember our three rules.

126
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Don't go beyond ten steps after the war.

127
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Can you keep up?

128
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
As long as you don't turn around,

129
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
it's okay.

130
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
But the place where the shadow is,

131
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
is still under the control of the evil demon.

132
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
How can you go down?

133
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I have my own way.

134
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
A broken cloud.

135
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Who are you?

136
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm just a sword master

137
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
who likes cute masks.

138
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Qin Lan.

139
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Qin Lan.

140
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Qin Lan.

141
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Qin Lan.

142
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Qin Lan.

143
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Sister!

144
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm here!

145
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Sister, why are you so late?

146
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

147
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Stop!

148
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You are from the Masked Club?

149
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Ranyu.

150
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
The Masked Club is despising the Yi Qi Alliance

151
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
and trying to destroy the Yi Qi.

152
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
It's a bad omen.

153
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
It's your bad luck to meet us today.

154
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
The evil demon doesn't dare to kill Xue.

155
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It's a waste of Yi Qi.

156
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
This is the illegal group of the Yi Qi Alliance?

157
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I think the Yi Qi Alliance is the most rude.

158
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Brother,

159
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
these three noble brothers said

160
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
that we would be unlucky if we met them.

161
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Brother Masked,

162
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
they also said that they were going to attack Nan Chuai.

163
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
They are all lies.

164
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
We are from the Nan Gu family.

165
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
How dare they use us to fight?

166
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I'll kill you when I go to the police station.

167
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
The people who were kidnapped

168
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
should be locked up here.

169
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Lock these three people up again.

170
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
The rest of you, save them.

171
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Okay, brother.

172
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Where is the evil demon?

173
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Take me there.

174
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
No problem.

175
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'm afraid you'll die.

176
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'm not going back.

177
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I'll go with you.

178
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I can't be away from you.

179
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Okay.

180
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
What is this?

181
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I promised my wife

182
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
that I would give you a gift

183
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
after you recovered.

184
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
We are not married.

185
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Who is your wife?

186
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
If she sees this gift,

187
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
she will agree to marry me.

188
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I only went to your house three times.

189
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I didn't remember all of them.

190
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
When I found the painting of your building,

191
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
it was exactly the same as yours.

192
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Kill them!

193
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Kill them!

194
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Kill them!

195
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
You remember the sad story again?

196
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
What's the matter?

197
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Our clan leader

198
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
recently built a prison.

199
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Sometimes he would go to the Nangong family

200
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
to steal some wood.

201
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
But he never killed them alone.

202
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I don't understand

203
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
why they

204
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
want to destroy our whole clan.

205
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Let me show you something.

206
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I caught the Nangong family

207
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
to build the Zhai Xing Building.

208
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
After the building was completed,

209
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I killed them all

210
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
and made their bones and weapons into ancient spirits.

211
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Do you like it?

212
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
You killed so many people in the Nangong family.

213
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
There are more people outside the building.

214
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
The head of the Nangong family

215
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
will hang on this one day.

216
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I'm afraid that

217
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
the Nangong family will be in danger.

218
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
But if you do this,

219
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
will it cause trouble?

220
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Of course.

221
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
You are the Demon Lord of the Wooden Wooden?

222
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Who are you?

223
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
How dare you trespass into my forbidden area?

224
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
You are so tough.

225
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
You are from the Yi Qi Alliance.

226
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
You are so tough.

227
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
You are so tough.

228
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
The barrier of the Wooden Wooden.

229
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
The Demon Lord of the Wooden Wooden,

230
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
the Demon Lord of the South Hammer,

231
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
has golden eyes.

232
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Every golden eye has a hundred years of cultivation.

233
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Its power is strong,

234
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
it can break through the soul and can't be broken.

235
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
But today, the back of the Eastern Fire is here.

236
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Your star is here.

237
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Demon Lord.

238
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
What magic weapon did you use

239
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
to break my thousand-year-old demon mother?

240
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
This is a silk from Miss Dong Fang.

241
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
The Eastern Fire.

242
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Everyone, please leave.

243
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Do good deeds without leaving a name.

244
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
If you insist on being merciful,

245
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
please pass on the message to the two little heroes of the Eastern House.

246
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Thank you.

247
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
We saved them.

248
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
We took care of the bad guys.

249
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Brother, are you going to fight with me?

250
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
You...

251
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
No, no, no.

252
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Of course, Miss Dong Fang is a good fighter.

253
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Look.

254
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Brother, you are so kind.

255
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Let's stay here

256
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
and wait for my sister and your brother.

257
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Let's wait.

258
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Let them fight together.

259
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Let them develop their relationship.

260
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Demon Lord built this Star Tower for me.

261
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
You said you would fight with your life.

262
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Then I will...

263
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Miss Dong Fang.

264
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Humans are the most cold-blooded.

265
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
You are so cold-blooded

266
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
when you talk about love.

267
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Even if you and the Yi Qi Alliance have a chance,

268
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
those people who were taken by you

269
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
are innocent.

270
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Innocent?

271
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Do you know how many people in this Star Tower

272
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
used to live in my tribe?

273
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
4871 people.

274
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
That killing,

275
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
the fire burned for seven days.

276
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
They lost their lives.

277
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Are they guilty?

278
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Sister.

279
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Sister.

280
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Let me go.

281
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
My parents

282
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
and my brother who died in the fire for only ten days.

283
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
He is guilty.

284
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
What did we do wrong?

285
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Wrong?

286
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
We only punished a golden man

287
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
who was the master of the South Palace.

288
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
He used it to build a coffin.

289
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
But it was a box that pretended to be a dead man.

290
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
It took us five thousand lives.

291
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
In the eyes of your people,

292
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
it is our fault

293
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
that we were born to be demons.

294
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I killed my brother.

295
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
The Dunean tribe is peaceful.

296
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
If I were to choose,

297
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I would choose my brother.

298
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
When the Yiqi Alliance attacked the South Palace,

299
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
your brother's group of demons were killed.

300
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Can you really bear the heavy price?

301
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
This is the document that the South Palace asked the Yiqi Alliance

302
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
to attack the South Palace?

303
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
The South Palace family killed the Dunean tribe

304
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
because of a coffin.

305
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
You killed so many of his children.

306
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Do you think this is not enough for your South Palace to pay for the death?

307
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Who are you?

308
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Where did this document come from?

309
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
It doesn't matter.

310
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
What matters is whether you believe it or not.

311
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
The South Palace family is protecting the sky with one hand.

312
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Every word said in this document

313
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
will become reality.

314
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
You may not be afraid of a South Palace family.

315
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
But what if the whole Yiqi Alliance is in danger?

316
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
You came to me

317
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
just to say this?

318
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
No.

319
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I came to kill you.

320
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Demon Lord of the Hundred-Way Tomb.

321
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
If I use your demon elixir to save Nan Chuai,

322
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
would you dare to give it to me?

323
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
How can a person save a demon?

324
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
The South Palace family is innocent.

325
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
You, Demon Lord of the Hundred-Way Tomb, are also innocent.

326
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
What I want to save is the poisonous bird.

327
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I want to save you.

328
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I want to save you.

329
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
You are innocent.

330
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
What I want to save is the poisonous bird.

331
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I want their family,

332
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
their parents,

333
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
and their brother who became the King of Wei

334
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
to not die.

335
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Although I am human,

336
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
not everyone

337
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
is a South Palace.

338
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
How dare you

339
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
come to my South Palace to play tricks?

340
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Have you ever thought about

341
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
the consequences of being dead?

342
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
The Demon Lord of the Hundred-Way Tomb

343
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
is the King of the South Palace.

344
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Hurry up and get out of the building.

345
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
This kind of demon elixir,

346
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
are you the King of the South Palace?

347
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
You are the King of the South Palace.

348
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
You dare to come to my South Palace

349
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
to play tricks?

350
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Even my nephew, the Demon Lord of the Hundred-Way Tomb,

351
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
dares to touch it.

352
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
You and you

353
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
will all die.

354
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
What a strong demon aura.

355
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Is this the Demon Lord of the Hundred-Way Tomb?

356
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Is he that powerful?

357
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
How can he be so powerful?

358
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Miss Dong Fang,

359
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
please stay here.

360
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Be careful.

361
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I will use your firework.

362
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Young people,

363
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
you are quite something.

364
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
But compared to me,

365
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
you are still two or three thousand years

366
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
behind in your cultivation and fire.

367
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Hurry up and leave.

368
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I will take away

369
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
my nephew's demon elixir.

370
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
You still don't come out?

371
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I'm coming.

372
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Fourth Brother,

373
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
your sword is getting more and more sharp.

374
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Boss, you are right.

375
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
This sword can block the attack of the Old Man of the Capital.

376
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
It's not bad.

377
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
The battle of the King of the South Palace,

378
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
after thousands of years of cultivation, is really amazing.

379
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
If so,

380
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
then we will kill a living one.

381
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
You have a good temper.

382
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Let's see if you can

383
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
break my spell.

384
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Third Brother, help me out.

385
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Coming.

386
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
As expected,

387
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
even if it's a poison body,

388
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
it's based on the behavior of the seven people.

389
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
As long as you lock the air vein,

390
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
you can temporarily contain the attack of the Old Man.

391
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Old Man, what else do you have?

392
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I only know to carry.

393
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Again?

394
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
How much can you use?

395
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Fourth Brother,

396
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
again.

397
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Go.

398
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I want to break the sword.

399
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
This is good.

400
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I can use it as a sword.

401
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Brother,

402
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
another bottle of wine.

403
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Wait for me.

404
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Miss, please be patient.

405
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I don't know if you can do it,

406
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
but let me do it first.

407
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
The sword is locked.

408
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
One more time.

409
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I will break your

410
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
power.

411
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
3rd Brother, 4th Brother,

412
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
take Miss away first.

413
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
The End

414
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
The wind blows, the city falls

415
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
The sun falls, the moon rises

416
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
The moon falls, the moon rises

417
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
You are the light of the night

418
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
You are the light of the night

419
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
But I

420
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
But I

421
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
