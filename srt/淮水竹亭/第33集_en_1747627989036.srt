00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Dad, no!

9
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Dad, no!

10
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Dad said

11
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
to protect everyone

12
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
but couldn't do it

13
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
But

14
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Ancestor

15
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
can protect you

16
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Dream

17
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Wake up

18
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Dream

19
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Yitan

20
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Although A'Zui is playful and willful since childhood

21
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
But A'Zui knew since childhood

22
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
A'Zui

23
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
likes Yitan

24
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
and the Masked Girl Group

25
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You are more important than my life

26
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So even the world is dark

27
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
A'Zui is not afraid

28
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Because we have love

29
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Right?

30
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Do you remember this?

31
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
We promised each other

32
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
to be together forever

33
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
and never leave each other

34
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Dream

35
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Yitan

36
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Don't leave me

37
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Then promise me one thing

38
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Ok?

39
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
We

40
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
together

41
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
find the original Yang Yitan

42
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Ok?

43
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Dream

44
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
My name is Wang Qianzui

45
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
From now on, Yitan is mine

46
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
My mom is

47
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
loved by thousands

48
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
My life

49
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
A'Zui's life

50
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Nothing to hesitate

51
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I choose her

52
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Love me

53
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
more than love yourself

54
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Yitan

55
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Is this your heart?

56
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Yitan

57
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I like you

58
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
No matter what happens in the future

59
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I will be with you

60
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I will be with you

61
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
face to face

62
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Even if we are together

63
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
only one year, one month

64
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
one day

65
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I just want to be with you

66
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
At the beginning of December

67
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
our wedding date will not change

68
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
When we come back

69
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
we will get married

70
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Ok

71
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
This life, this heart

72
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
is yours

73
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So

74
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Go to see what you want to see

75
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Yitan

76
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
A'Zui

77
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
The black fox

78
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
took my eyes

79
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
He knew

80
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
we were together

81
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
He knew

82
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
we were together

83
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
He knew

84
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
we were together

85
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
He knew

86
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
all of us were weak

87
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
He knew

88
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
all of you

89
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
were weak

90
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Where are you?

91
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Brother

92
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
The ending of the mask group

93
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
can't be changed, right?

94
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Break the darkness

95
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
destroy the black fox

96
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I will be with you

97
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Yitan

98
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I will be with you

99
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Yitan

100
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Yitan

101
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Yitan

102
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Yitan

103
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Black fox

104
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I am Chen Hongyan

105
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You are so cruel

106
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Brother, it's my fault

107
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Brother, it's my fault

108
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's all because of you

109
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It's all because of you

110
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Brother

111
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
A'Zui

112
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Chen Hongyan

113
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Look at your hands

114
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Look at your hands

115
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Who are you?

116
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
The fate of the black fox

117
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
can't be changed

118
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I will kill you

119
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I will kill you

120
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Why?

121
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Why did you let them come here?

122
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Chen Hongyan

123
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You are the only one

124
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I can't save you

125
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I can't save you

126
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Brother

127
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
No one can get out

128
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
No one can get out

129
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I will kill you

130
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I will kill you

131
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You are dead

132
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Take revenge

133
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I will kill you

134
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You are dead

135
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I will kill you

136
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I will kill you

137
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Bring us back to the Earth

138
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
We are all dead

139
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Is this...

140
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Why are you alive?

141
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
We are still together

142
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Brother

143
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You are still alive

144
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You killed him!

145
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
How could you kill me?

146
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You killed us!

147
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Big Brother!

148
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Big Brother!

149
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
The Masked Brigade!

150
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
You can't lose!

151
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
The end of this world...

152
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
is definitely not darkness.

153
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
The Masked Brigade

154
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
A'Cui...

155
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Second Brother is here.

156
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
The Masked Brigade

157
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'll kill you!

158
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
The Masked Brigade

159
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
The Masked Brigade

160
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Here they come.

161
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
The Masked Brigade

162
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Wang Quanhong, are you here to change your fate?

163
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
You should stay and work with your Masked Brigade.

164
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
The Masked Brigade

165
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
The Masked Brigade

166
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
The one who was imprisoned by the Black Fox for a hundred years...

167
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
should not be sent back to the heaven.

168
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
As long as we destroy the Black Fox, everything will end.

169
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:14,700
Bu Mu, I need all the victims of the

170
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Black Fox.

171
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
The Masked Brigade

172
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
The Masked Brigade

173
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
My dear...

174
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
You really want to die by being the Sword of Heaven and Earth?

175
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I have no choice but to give up my life for this.

176
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
The Masked Brigade

177
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
The Masked Brigade

178
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
The Masked Brigade

179
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Impossible! How could humans kill me?

180
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
How could humans kill me?

181
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
How could humans kill me?

182
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
The Black Fox is back.

183
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
The Black Fox's power should have been weakened.

184
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I wonder how Hongye and the others are doing.

185
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Your spiritual power has been exhausted.

186
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I'll take you to the Heavenly Gate Pass.

187
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Okay.

188
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Second Master, Miss Dongfang,

189
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
a person from the Sacred Fire Manor is outside the border.

190
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
What is it?

191
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
She said her name is Xiaodong.

192
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
She said she was going to the Heavenly Gate Pass.

193
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
She said she was going to the Heavenly Gate Pass.

194
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
She said she was going to the Heavenly Gate Pass.

195
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
She said her name is Xiaodong.

196
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Second Miss told her to say that the old master is sick and asked you to return quickly.

197
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Senior Brother.

198
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
How is my father?

199
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Junior Sister, you're finally back.

200
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
The master was in the fire the other day.

201
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Junior Sister, I know you love your father.

202
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
The master is in the fire.

203
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I'm using the real weapon to kill him.

204
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
He needs to recuperate now.

205
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Can't I see him?

206
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Junior Sister hasn't been back for so long.

207
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Why don't you go back to the Bamboo Courtyard first?

208
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
You can see Junior Sister Qin Lan.

209
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Xiaodong, escort Miss Dongfang back to the Bamboo Courtyard.

210
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Miss Dongfang, please.

211
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Please wait.

212
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Miss, I...

213
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Sister.

214
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,900
Don't forget me for the next two years.

215
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,300
Kelly!

216
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,180
I can't go alone,

217
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,180
Kelly should go with me,

218
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,140
and be with you.

219
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:45,820
Sis!

220
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I can't bear to kiss you.

221
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Miss.

222
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
What's up?

223
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Senior Brother told me to bring Yu Ping to serve you.

224
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
You're obviously looking for someone to spy on us.

225
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I know.

226
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Leave him here.

227
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Yes.

228
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Get up.

229
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
You're forced to do this.

230
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
You've been with us for so many years.

231
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I won't make things difficult for you.

232
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Yu Ping.

233
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Do you have anything to tell me?

234
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Miss.

235
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Jin Ruofeng...

236
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Jin Ruofeng killed Master.

237
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I saw it with my own eyes.

238
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I'm sorry.

239
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Senior Brother.

240
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Did you do everything as I told you?

241
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Don't worry, Senior Brother.

242
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I've done everything as you told me.

243
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I've turned Master's Xiao Ke Wan into a Man Duo.

244
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Tonight, he will definitely be in trouble.

245
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Clear the scene immediately.

246
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Tonight,

247
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
no one is allowed to appear here.

248
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Yes.

249
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Master.

250
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Junior Sister has already noticed that I have colluded with Black Tiger.

251
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
He will definitely clear the door and drive me out.

252
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
For so many years,

253
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I've been a slave and a horse.

254
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
But in your eyes,

255
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I'm always just one.

256
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I can drive out the dogs in my family at any time.

257
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I'm not fair in my heart.

258
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
In terms of talent,

259
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
in terms of talent,

260
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
which point of me is inferior to Wang Quanhong?

261
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I'm just a loser.

262
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Master.

263
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Anyway, you can't live long.

264
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Why don't you give me the surprise that can control the pure Yang Yan in your body?

265
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Let me become a real living god.

266
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Master.

267
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Master.

268
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Master.

269
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Master.

270
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Master.

271
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Master.

272
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Master.

273
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Master.

274
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Master.

275
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Master.

276
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Master.

277
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Master.

278
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Master.

279
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Master.

280
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Master.

281
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Master.

282
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
With your blood,

283
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
the power of life is completely different.

284
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Master, don't worry.

285
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I've already exchanged my blood for your body.

286
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
No one will notice it.

287
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
By the way, master.

288
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I'm going to marry two sisters.

289
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
It's a good idea.

290
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I'm going to marry two sisters.

291
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I'm going to marry two sisters.

292
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I'm going to marry two sisters.

293
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Then you could use the other secret that Dong Fanglin wrote.

294
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Do you hate me?

295
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
It's useless.

296
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I've already told you.

297
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
They're mine.

298
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Hahahaha

299
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Hahahaha

300
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Hahahaha

301
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Hahahaha

302
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Hahahaha

303
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
You saw my father

304
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I saw it

305
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
The old owner closed his eyes

306
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Close his eyes

307
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
People

308
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
People

309
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
People

310
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
You should die

311
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Okay

312
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
He has now

313
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Became a pure eye

314
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Sister is now crying

315
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
We are not his opponents

316
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Many outsiders came from Shenzhou

317
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
All big brother's dogs

318
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I can't

319
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
He must die

320
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Mei Ping

321
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
You tell Yao Dong

322
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Qinglan is sick

323
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
it is good

324
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I am not sick

325
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I am not sick

326
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I am not sick

327
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I am not sick

328
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I am not sick

329
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I am not sick

330
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I am not sick

331
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I am not sick

332
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I am not sick

333
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I am not sick

334
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I am not sick

335
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I am not sick

336
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I am not sick

337
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I am not sick

338
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I am not sick

339
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I am not sick

340
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I am not sick

341
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I am not sick

342
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I am not sick

343
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I am not sick

344
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I am not sick

345
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I am not sick

346
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I am not sick

347
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I am not sick

348
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I am not sick

349
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I am not sick

350
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I am not sick

351
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I am not sick

352
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I am not sick

353
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I am not sick

354
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I am not sick

355
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I am not sick

356
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I am not sick

357
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I am not sick

358
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I am not sick

359
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I am not sick

360
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
I am not sick

361
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I am not sick

362
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I am not sick

363
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
I am not sick

364
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I am not sick

365
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I am not sick

366
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Even if I forget everything in the world

367
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I will see the world through thousands of years

368
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I will see the world through thousands of years

369
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I will see the world through thousands of years

370
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000

00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I will see the world through thousands of years

379
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I will see the world through thousands of years

380
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I will see the world through thousands of years

381
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I will see the world through thousands of years

00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I will see the world through thousands of years

00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I will see the world through thousands of years

I will see the world through thousands of years

386
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I will see the world through thousands of years

387
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I will see the world through thousands of years

388
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I will see the world through thousands of years

389
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
