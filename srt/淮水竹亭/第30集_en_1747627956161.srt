1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,800
Miss plants

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,160
Love and hate are both

3
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,040
Flowing

4
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,520
The wind blows

5
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,720
The sky is as clear as the end

6
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,960
Don't turn back and keep walking

7
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,760
Life and death are in front of you

8
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,280
From the flames

9
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,520
Whose love

10
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,040
Is more vast than the universe

11
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,280
Don't turn back and keep walking

12
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,160
Life and death are in front of you

13
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,640
From the flames

14
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,880
Whose love

15
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,560
Is more vast than the universe

16
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,520
It's me

17
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,000
The Long Ballad

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Good things, good things, delicious, delicious

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,800
Good bread invites you to watch the water-returning kitchen

20
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:55,800
Episode 2

21
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,600
Miss, this wonton is really delicious.

22
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,200
I think so too.

23
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,600
The wonton is here.

24
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,200
Please enjoy.

25
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,800
Daddy, what's wrong?

26
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,800
Daddy is fine.

27
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,800
Xiaorou, daddy will take you to fly.

28
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,800
Let's fly!

29
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,800
Brother, you're looking for me?

30
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,800
You're looking for me?

31
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,800
The Love Letter of the Dark Valley and the Love Letter of the Mountain of the Bitter

32
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,800
Are finally connected.

33
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,800
With her personality, she won't forgive herself.

34
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,800
Then what should we do?

35
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,800
You stay and accompany her.

36
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,800
Don't worry about other things.

37
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,800
Huai Zhu and I will go to Mount Tu.

38
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,800
Okay.

39
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,800
Who are you?

40
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,800
Why are you here in Mount Tu?

41
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,800
Mount Wangquan, Mount Wangquan Hongye.

42
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,800
Mount Shenhuo, East Huai Zhu.

43
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,800
Mount Shenhuo and Mount Wangquan people.

44
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,800
Come to Mount Tu to provoke?

45
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,800
We came to Mount Tu for the Love Letter of the Bitter.

46
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,800
The Love Letter of the Bitter seems to be decaying.

47
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,800
This is my Mount Tu matter.

48
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,800
It has nothing to do with you.

49
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,800
The Love Letter of the Bitter will decay.

50
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,800
It has something to do with the Dark Lake outside the circle.

51
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,800
What do you mean?

52
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,800
In the two realms of the human and demon,

53
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,800
there is a Love Letter of the Bitter.

54
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,800
The Love Letter of the Bitter was born out of love.

55
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,800
The Love Letter of the Bitter is raised by hatred.

56
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,800
The Dark Lake has already penetrated the connection of the two trees.

57
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,800
The Love Letter of the Bitter is now

58
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,800
crazy to absorb the power of the Love Letter of the Bitter.

59
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,800
Love and hate will grow and will last forever.

60
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,800
You actually...

61
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,800
Why is there a soul fragment of the Dark Lake in your body?

62
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,800
You even refined it.

63
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,800
You became its guest.

64
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,800
The Love Letter of the Bitter

65
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,800
If what you said is true,

66
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,800
and the situation is big,

67
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,800
I will wait for my sister and Rong Rong to come back and make a decision.

68
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,800
The Chief and your third sister

69
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,800
should have heard our conversation.

70
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,800
We came here not to seek help,

71
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,800
but to seek for life together.

72
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,900
The

73
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,800
Chuchuan and Tushan can't survive.

74
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,800
This is the consequence that everyone knows.

75
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,800
You mean

76
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,800
you are also helping us, Tushan?

77
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,800
No.

78
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,800
We want to save the world's people with Tushan.

79
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,800
I'm sure Tushan also knows

80
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,800
that we don't have much time left.

81
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,800
That's why you will see us.

82
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,800
What are your plans?

83
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,800
Can you kill them?

84
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,800
As long as you tell us

85
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,800
how the West Martial Arts Flower can control the Dark Lake,

86
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,800
we can do it.

87
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,800
You have witnessed your own end.

88
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,800
Why do you still do this?

89
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,800
Because I believe

90
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,800
that the future can be changed.

91
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,800
Rong Rong can't change it.

92
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,800
If you don't do it,

93
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,800
there will be no answer.

94
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,800
The West Martial Arts Flower

95
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,800
contains the fragments of the Dark Lake's soul.

96
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,800
It absorbs and purifies many of the soul-gathering spirit.

97
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,800
It's pure and powerful.

98
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,800
It's indeed a Dark Lake's star.

99
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,800
How do you use it after you leave the circle?

100
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,800
Your power

101
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,800
can be used above the Love Tree.

102
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,800
Since the path has been cleared,

103
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,800
you can use the power of the West Martial Arts Flower

104
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,800
to take the West Martial Arts Flower.

105
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,800
I can't do it.

106
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,800
I can't do it.

107
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,800
I can't do it.

108
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,800
I can't do it.

109
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,800
You can use the power of the West Martial Arts Flower

110
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,800
to take the power of the Love Tree.

111
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,800
The Love Tree

112
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,800
is the source of the power of the Dark Lake.

113
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,800
Then I will do it now.

114
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,800
No.

115
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,800
If you start now,

116
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,800
the Dark Lake will realize

117
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,800
that its power is much greater than yours.

118
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,800
So the best way

119
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,800
is to kill it

120
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,800
when it leaves the circle.

121
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,800
You should make a mutual alliance

122
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,800
to lead the Dark Lake

123
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,800
and kill it.

124
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,800
It's a cruel thing.

125
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,800
You can't

126
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,800
leave the circle with it.

127
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,800
The bitter love flower

128
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,800
blooms for the one who loves her.

129
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,800
Take a look at the scenery.

130
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,800
Who is in the heart of love?

131
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,800
Love comes from love

132
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,800
and leaves without a care.

133
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,800
True heart can change true heart.

134
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,800
No need to arrange everything.

135
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,800
The breath is white.

136
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:01,800
The heart is hidden in the beautiful love.

137
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,800
Don't think about anything.

138
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,800
Nothing

139
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,800
is better than this moment.

140
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,800
Maybe love

141
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,800
blooms in the heart

142
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,800
and causes you to bloom.

143
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,800
So love is in the heart.

144
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,800
But love is more comfortable

145
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,800
than love.

146
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,800
If we separate,

147
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,800
we will be more tender.

148
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,800
Excuse me.

149
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,800
My sister wants to see you.

150
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,800
I'm here.

151
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,800
My sister said

152
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,800
the whole Tushan

153
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,800
will work together

154
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,800
to help you kill the Dark Lake.

155
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,800
Thank you.

156
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,800
My sister also asked me to tell you

157
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,800
that the connection between the two bitter love flowers

158
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,800
needs to be harmonious in the circle.

159
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,800
And the person who helps in the circle

160
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,800
can be determined now

161
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,800
to be a monster with high power.

162
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,800
Do you know its origin?

163
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,800
A monster?

164
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,800
It doesn't matter.

165
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,800
I just need to rest for a while.

166
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,800
Lord Jiuhuo,

167
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,800
Yiqi Alliance is here.

168
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,800
Lord Jiuhuo,

169
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,800
my master has something important to do.

170
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,800
He wants to see you.

171
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,800
Tell him

172
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,800
I'll be there soon.

173
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,800
Yiqi Alliance does have a mole.

174
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,800
Follow me.

175
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,800
What do you want from me?

176
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,800
Lord Jiuhuo.

177
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,800
You don't look good.

178
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,800
I'm fine.

179
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,800
What is that?

180
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,800
Demon Pill.

181
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,800
Qin Ranfeng,

182
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,800
are you looking for death?

183
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,800
Lord,

184
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,800
what kind of Pill

185
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,800
can be used to make the Demon Pill?

186
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,800
The Demon of Heaven and the Nine Devils

187
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,800
are said to be the strongest in the world

188
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,800
for almost a thousand years.

189
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,800
I don't think it's too bad.

190
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,800
What are you?

191
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,800
You deserve to speak out in front of me.

192
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,800
Dragon Blood.

193
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,800
That's right.

194
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,800
Dragon Blood.

195
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,800
Your personality.

196
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,800
Jiuhuo,

197
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,800
Jiuhuo,

198
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,800
your memory is broken.

199
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,800
Aren't you from the Imperial Fist Clan?

200
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,800
Why haven't you recovered?

201
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,800
So you're that capable.

202
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,800
Jiuhuo,

203
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,800
Jiuhuo,

204
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,800
Jiuhuo,

205
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,800
Jiuhuo,

206
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,800
Jiuhuo,

207
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,800
Jiuhuo,

208
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,800
Jiuhuo,

209
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,800
Jiuhuo,

210
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,800
Jiuhuo,

211
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,800
Jiuhuo,

212
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,800
Jiuhuo,

213
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,800
Jiuhuo,

214
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,800
Jiuhuo,

215
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,800
Jiuhuo,

216
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,800
Jiuhuo,

217
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,800
Jiuhuo,

218
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,800
Jiuhuo,

219
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,800
Jiuhuo,

220
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,800
Jiuhuo,

221
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,800
Jiuhuo,

222
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,800
Jiuhuo,

223
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,800
Jiuhuo,

224
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,800
Jiuhuo,

225
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,800
Jiuhuo,

226
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,800
Jiuhuo,

227
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,800
Jiuhuo,

228
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,800
Jiuhuo,

229
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,800
Jiuhuo,

230
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,800
Jiuhuo,

231
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,800
Jin Renfu,

232
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,800
I must kill you.

233
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,800
Jiuhuo from the whole Sheng Dynasty

234
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,800
could kill me

235
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,800
with a simple stab.

236
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,800
But you just

237
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,800
cleared the path of love

238
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,800
and used up your power.

239
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,800
It's not working.

240
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,800
Do you want to know

241
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,800
why I know you can't do it?

242
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,800
And why I know

243
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,800
that Long Xie is your guest?

244
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,800
Impossible.

245
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,800
Your Highness Black Fox,

246
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,800
if you don't come out and make it clear,

247
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,800
I'm afraid that I, Jin Renfu,

248
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,800
will never be able to obey you.

249
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,800
Jiuhuo,

250
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,800
I know you miss Jialan very much.

251
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,800
I'll show you the last glimpse of her.

252
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,800
Jialan.

253
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,800
Jin Renfu,

254
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,800
how could you do this?

255
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,800
This is the only demon

256
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,800
I care about.

257
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,800
Your Highness Black Fox,

258
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,800
the demon elixir is used to practice swordplay.

259
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,800
The more you think about it,

260
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,800
the better it will work.

261
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,800
Do you want my demon elixir

262
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,800
to practice swordplay?

263
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,800
Practice?

264
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,800
Yes.

265
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,800
Your spine is broken.

266
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,800
It will take so long to recover.

267
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,800
It seems that the demon elixir is running out.

268
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,800
It's no longer useful.

269
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,800
You're not Jialan.

270
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,800
Am I not the little fox

271
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,800
that you miss so much?

272
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,800
You're not.

273
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,800
You're not.

274
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,800
Look at you.

275
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,800
You're carrying a wound

276
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,800
that can never be healed for me.

277
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,800
It's really heart-wrenching.

278
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,800
You've sent the demon elixir

279
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,800
to repair the Heart of the Golden Pond

280
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,800
and came back without any reason.

281
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,800
Even if you're exhausted from the demon power,

282
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,800
you have to connect the bitter love letter.

283
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,800
For Jialan,

284
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,800
I would do anything for her.

285
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,800
But she's dead.

286
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,800
I'm the new mother

287
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,800
who was born after Jialan died

288
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,800
after thousands of years of grudges.

289
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,800
Impossible.

290
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,800
I can definitely save her back.

291
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,800
After all these years,

292
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,800
I've been thinking

293
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,800
that we're both demons.

294
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,800
If we're strong,

295
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,800
then there's no enemy in the world.

296
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,800
Which step is wrong?

297
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,800
Do you know?

298
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,800
Because we have love.

299
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,800
Love is our biggest weakness

300
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,800
and the only weakness.

301
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,800
We have to give it up.

302
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,800
Are you crazy?

303
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,800
I feel heartache too.

304
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,800
But every time she hurts,

305
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,800
she reminds me that

306
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,800
my weakness is still there.

307
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,800
That's her blood.

308
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,800
She'll still hurt.

309
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,800
As long as she can come back,

310
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,800
I'm willing to do anything.

311
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,800
Jialan,

312
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,800
I know you're still here.

313
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,800
I can definitely save you.

314
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,800
We can still be together.

315
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,800
She's dead.

316
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,800
I'm Jialan now.

317
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,800
Don't you feel touched?

318
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,800
What do you want to do?

319
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,800
I want to persuade the world to die with us

320
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,800
and let all the feelings in the world

321
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,800
disappear.

322
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,800
Forget about the past.

323
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,800
Jialan.

324
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,800
Lord Jiuhuo,

325
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,800
you know that I only appreciate the strong.

326
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,800
Since you're gone,

327
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,800
why don't you keep the Elixir of Demons to me?

328
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,800
I'll still miss your love.

329
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,800
You're crazy!

330
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,800
But you're now too weak.

331
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,800
This demon elixir is in the Sword-Picking Bracelet.

332
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,800
It should be melted in a month.

333
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,800
Give me back my Jialan!

334
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,800
Take a good look.

335
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,800
Who am I?

336
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:53,800
Sir, the butterfly should die at its most beautiful moment.

337
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,800
Isn't it?

338
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,800
I'll leave the sword and the phoenix to you.

339
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,800
This...

340
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,800
The Sword-Picking Bracelet.

341
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:38,800
You want to take my demon elixir too?

342
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,800
Jin Ranfang.

343
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,800
It seems that you don't understand the word,

344
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,800
the Demon of Heaven, very well.

345
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,800
I'm the one who defeated the entire dragon clan.

346
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,800
Lord Jiuhuo.

347
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,800
I've been alone all my life.

348
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,800
I never wanted to take other people's demon power and spiritual power.

349
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,800
It means that I won't.

350
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,800
The Demon of Hell.

351
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,800
You came at the right time.

352
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,800
The Demon of Heaven.

353
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,800
The Demon of Hell.

354
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,800
Jiuhuo.

355
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,800
What a powerful demon power.

356
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,800
Lord.

357
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,800
Hongye of the Hell.

358
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,800
What's the grudge between us?

359
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,800
You've ruined my big plan.

360
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:08,800
If you weren't my Jialan,

361
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,800
I wouldn't have been able to defeat you.

362
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,800
I've come back long ago.

363
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,800
Jiuhuo.

364
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,800
You've used up your power.

365
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,800
Do you want to keep struggling?

366
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,800
I know that I'm about to die.

367
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,800
The spiritual power that I've absorbed

368
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,800
will only speed up my cultivation.

369
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:38,800
But there's nothing left in this world that I'm left with.

370
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,800
You said that you represent justice.

371
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:44,800
Do you know the grudge of being planned by a shameless disciple?

372
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,800
The pain of dying in front of you,

373
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:51,800
the darkness of being sealed for 500 years,

374
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:55,800
and the despair of being betrayed by your own love.

375
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,800
I've never been enlightened in my life.

376
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:02,800
I'm going to destroy you all.

377
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,800
Hongye of the Hell.

378
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:08,800
I want you to die without a place to bury yourself.

379
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,800
Try your own death.

380
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,800
Lose the pain of your love.

381
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,800
I, Jiuhuo,

382
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,800
will destroy everything.

383
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,800
I'll destroy the thunder of heaven.

384
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:44,800
I'll destroy all love and light in this world.

385
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,800
I'll destroy all the power and the evil.

386
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,800
I'll destroy all the evil.

387
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,800
You've been talking nonsense today.

388
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,800
You're really a lot.

389
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,800
You have nothing.

390
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,800
All love and heaven's will

391
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,800
are the will of the people.

392
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,800
The light of love in this world

393
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,800
will never die.

394
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:30,800
Heaven, earth, and you.

395
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,800
You!

396
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,800
Jiuhuo, your power is exhausted.

397
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,800
You're hurt by the sword of heaven and earth.

398
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,800
You're no longer immortal.

399
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,800
My Jialan is dead.

400
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,800
Do you think I care about life and death?

401
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:33,800
I came to the world this morning.

402
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:37,800
I have no choice.

403
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:41,800
I do what I want to do.

404
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:45,800
I don't feel comfortable.

405
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:49,800
There is a time of chaos.

406
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:54,800
There is a time of darkness.

407
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,800
I admit my mistakes.

408
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,800
But I won't.

409
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,800
Wang Juan Hongye,

410
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:11,800
if you can kill me in the world,

411
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,800
you might be able to kill the black fox.

412
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,800
It's great.

413
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:24,800
Kill the black fox for me.

414
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,800
Let Jialan be free.

415
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,800
Little fox.

416
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,800
Do I look like a fox?

417
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,800
Yes.

418
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,800
I'll take you...

419
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,800
back.

420
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:21,800
I'll take you back.

421
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,800
The love cries out.

422
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,800
The silence is broken.

423
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,800
Let the night be silent.

424
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,800
Let the night be silent.

425
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,800
Let the day be silent.

426
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,800
Let the day be silent.

427
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:41,800
Let the night be silent.

428
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,800
If I turn into a black fox,

429
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,800
I'll be the only one who can escape.

430
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:49,800
I feel sorry for Jiuhuo and Jialan.

431
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:53,800
But I don't agree with his method.

432
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,800
Most people think

433
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,800
that people or demons who have been hurt

434
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,800
will never be kind again.

435
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,800
So we're still in the world, not hell.

436
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,800
It's because there are still those

437
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,800
who have good intentions.

438
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,800
Then I hope that in the next life,

439
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,800
they can change their identity

440
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,800
and live an ordinary life.

441
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,800
Feng.

442
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:09,800
Feng, who hurt you?

443
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,800
It's okay if you don't want to answer.

444
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,800
I've always been here.

445
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,800
Tan.

446
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:24,800
What do you like about me?

447
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:28,800
I like you to be strong and domineering.

448
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,800
Our Shui Zhi Clan is a kind-hearted tribe.

449
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,800
My father and my brothers

450
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,800
are all weak bones.

451
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,800
Fatty.

452
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,800
Without the spirit blood,

453
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:45,800
I'm nothing.

454
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:49,800
I can only be the spirit.

455
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,800
Tan.

456
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:00,800
You said that the Great Blood Technique

457
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,800
has one last secret.

458
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,800
Did I learn it?

459
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,800
I can exchange the spirit blood.

460
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,800
Feng.

461
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,800
I can't teach you the last secret.

462
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,800
If Master finds out,

463
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,800
he won't let us go.

464
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,800
It's good that he doesn't know.

465
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,800
But I swore to Master

466
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,800
that only the devil can

467
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,800
betray me.

468
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,800
Heaven and earth are not for me.

469
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:44,800
So you don't love me.

470
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,800
You can go.

471
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,800
Feng.

472
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,800
Okay.

473
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,800
I can help you.

474
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,800
But you have to promise me

475
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,800
to kill Dongfang Huaizhu.

476
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:03,800
From now on, I'm the only woman in your heart.

477
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,800
Okay.

478
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,800
I promise you.

479
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,800
Tan.

480
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,800
You taught me the last secret

481
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,800
of the Great Blood Technique.

482
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:40,800
I'll remember it forever.

483
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,800
But I can't see it now.

484
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:03,800
You are the only woman in this world

485
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,800
who truly loves me.

486
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,800
But I actually put myself in a good person.

487
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,800
I wouldn't have been like this.

488
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,800
I'm sorry.

489
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,800
I'm sorry.

490
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,800
I'm sorry.

491
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,800
I'm sorry.

492
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,800
I'm sorry.

493
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,800
I'm sorry.

494
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,800
I'm sorry.

495
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,800
I'm sorry.

496
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,800
I'm sorry.

497
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,800
I'm sorry.

498
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,800
I'm sorry.

499
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,800
I'm sorry.

500
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,800
I'm sorry.

501
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,800
I'm sorry.

502
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,800
I'm sorry.

503
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,800
I'm sorry.

504
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,800
I'm sorry.

505
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,800
I'm sorry.

506
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,800
I'm sorry.

507
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,800
I'm sorry.

508
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,800
I'm sorry.

509
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,800
I'm sorry.

510
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,800
I'm sorry.

511
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,800
I'm sorry.

512
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,800
I'm sorry.

513
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,800
I'm sorry.

514
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,800
I'm sorry.

515
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,800
I'm sorry.

516
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,800
I'm sorry.

517
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,800
I'm sorry.

518
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,800
I'm sorry.

519
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,800
I'm sorry.

520
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,800
I'm sorry.

521
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,800
I'm sorry.

522
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,800
I'm sorry.

523
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,800
I'm sorry.

524
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,800
I'm sorry.

525
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,800
I'm sorry.

526
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,800
I'm sorry.

527
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,800
I'm sorry.

528
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,800
I'm sorry.

529
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,800
I'm sorry.

530
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,800
I'm sorry.

531
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,800
I'm sorry.

532
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,800
I'm sorry.

533
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,800
I'm sorry.

534
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,800
I'm sorry.

535
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,800
I'm sorry.

536
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,800
I'm sorry.

537
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,800
I'm sorry.

538
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,800
I'm sorry.

539
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,800
I'm sorry.

540
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,800
I'm sorry.

541
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,800
I'm sorry.

542
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,800
I'm sorry.

543
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,800
I'm sorry.

544
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,800
I'm sorry.

545
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,800
I'm sorry.

546
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,800
I'm sorry.

547
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,800
I'm sorry.

548
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,800
I'm sorry.

549
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,800
I'm sorry.

550
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,800
I'm sorry.

551
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,800
I'm sorry.

552
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,800
I'm sorry.

553
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,800
I'm sorry.

554
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,800
I'm sorry.

555
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,800
I'm sorry.

556
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,800
I'm sorry.

557
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,800
I'm sorry.

558
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,800
I'm sorry.
