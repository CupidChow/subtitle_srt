1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,540
suddenly

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,040
Love is like a flame that burns

3
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:11,720
The wind blows, the sky falls

4
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,760
Don't look back, keep walking, life goes on

5
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:22,480
From the fire to the fire, who's warm

6
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,040
The end of the world

7
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,120
Don't look back, keep walking, life goes on

8
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:35,880
From the fire to the fire, who's coming

9
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:42,520
The bright light of fate, it's me

10
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,000
The Long Ballad

11
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,560
Episode 16

12
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,640
Episode 26

13
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,440
Alright, let's just have a few fight.

14
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:03,120
Ask teacher to demonstrate to the village.

15
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,600
S完

16
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,120
Junior sister

17
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,440
You've built up Chunzhi's backyard

18
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,160
Master

19
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,680
Now she has made her run

20
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,280
incapable of

21
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,080
being vàoquied under Wangquan Sword

22
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,560
Don't still talk yummy

23
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,080
Ren Feng

24
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,320
for a while

25
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,080
for the sake of hurting those demons.

26
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,360
You'll have to send those demons

27
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,560
back to me in person.

28
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,840
From now on, think carefully

29
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,480
and don't make any more troubles.

30
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:04,920
Yes.

31
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,960
All disciples of the Sacred Fire Villa, listen up!

32
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,240
Yes!

33
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,320
Be merciful

34
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,800
and remember the people.

35
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,960
Don't ask about Jianghu.

36
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,920
Be a good person.

37
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:20,960
Yes!

38
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,760
Are you missing your Lady Huai Zhu again?

39
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,080
I heard that you were scolded by him today.

40
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,760
I thought you would be very angry.

41
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,520
You didn't see it with your own eyes

42
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,360
the beauty and power of that pure yang-yang.

43
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,320
This fire-fire-yan

44
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,080
is very good for him.

45
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,160
I'm sorry.

46
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,280
Tan,

47
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,120
you used this special spell to absorb the power of the demons

48
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,760
to help me cultivate the sacred fire.

49
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,360
Although it's useful,

50
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,160
I don't think it's enough.

51
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,920
Is there any better way?

52
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,320
There is a way.

53
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,080
But it's not the time to tell you.

54
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,840
What's wrong?

55
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,560
You don't believe me?

56
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,400
Isn't it?

57
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,760
There is always a Dongfang Huai Zhu in your heart.

58
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,240
With you,

59
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,920
I've been not interested in her for a long time.

60
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,720
Really?

61
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,320
But there has always been a rumor in our demon clan

62
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,240
that the blood of the Eastern Family

63
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,640
is the foundation of the inheritance.

64
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,320
That's nonsense.

65
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,600
Don't believe it.

66
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,760
I don't care what you think.

67
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,240
Anyway, I'm your demon now.

68
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,280
The demons of our Water Chizu

69
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,840
are very careful.

70
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,720
Don't let me down.

71
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,280
I won't let anyone down.

72
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,160
You're my baby.

73
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,360
Isaac?

74
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,920
What is this?

75
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,640
You keep it when the knife is quarters like this.

76
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,400
It might be useful.

77
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,920
You don't need to care. It has nothing to do with you.

78
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,680
How extraordinary lemme show you late night

79
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,420
Is the top nippon w去.

80
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,960
Isn't it scared everyone will notice?

81
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,300
I gve the final们 in my accent.

82
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:38,920
You are the honor given to Jialan by your mother.

83
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,920
What your mother Jiang Juexue did

84
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,920
was to find a new body for Jialan.

85
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,920
That is the Eastern Pillar.

86
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,920
So that is the daughter of Jiang Juexue.

87
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,920
Is it fun?

88
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,920
Very good. I like this container.

89
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,920
What is this?

90
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,920
Who are you?

91
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,920
Why do you have my magic?

92
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,920
I know who you are.

93
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,920
The Heaven and the Demon have been in the fire for a long time.

94
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,920
I also know that

95
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,920
you will not be able to come back

96
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,920
after twenty years.

97
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,920
As long as you follow the method I taught you

98
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,920
and repair the golden face for me,

99
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,920
I can return.

100
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,920
What a joke.

101
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,920
I am not a joke.

102
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,920
I am a man.

103
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,920
Joke?

104
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,920
Why should I do this?

105
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,920
Chen Fu and I

106
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,920
have completed the great achievement for me.

107
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,920
We will definitely get the reward.

108
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,920
Who can you fool?

109
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,920
Smart people

110
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,920
have time to think.

111
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,920
Think carefully.

112
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,920
The Heaven and the Demon

113
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,920
It has been almost five months.

114
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,920
You are not pregnant.

115
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,920
Are you too thin?

116
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,920
I have a good appetite.

117
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,920
But I have been eating spicy food lately.

118
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,920
Sour and spicy.

119
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,920
Maybe you will have a little niece.

120
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,920
Actually,

121
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,920
a little niece is also good.

122
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,920
What should I do?

123
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,920
I think it's all for the sake of the girl.

124
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,920
A Yan,

125
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,920
I will definitely protect you and the child.

126
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,920
I will also protect you.

127
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,920
I will also protect you.

128
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,920
Brother,

129
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,920
I'm not going anywhere.

130
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,920
I will definitely protect you.

131
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,920
Breathe in.

132
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,920
Breathe out.

133
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,920
Breathe in.

134
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,920
Breathe in.

135
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,920
Breathe out.

136
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,920
Brother,

137
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,920
are you still sad about not taking care of Mu Mei?

138
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,320
Yitan, go to the Poting Temple.

139
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,160
Dad.

140
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,640
Dad.

141
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,400
Here, take it.

142
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,640
Thank you, Dad.

143
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,640
Let me do it.

144
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,000
Slowly.

145
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:54,120
Thanks.

146
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,460
Wang YouTube

147
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,240
And finally...

148
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,080
This

149
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,320
I'll return it to you.

150
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,440
From the great telling,

151
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,560
He used all his energy to era it.

152
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,360
ня

153
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,800
As his most precious treasure on Earth.

154
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:54,880
No.

155
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,400
Can you give me

156
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,720
a gift that's convenient for me to keep?

157
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,040
Look at you.

158
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,840
You're still so clumsy.

159
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,360
I'll like everything you give me.

160
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,920
Don't cry, little Noodle.

161
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,200
I'm here to make a move.

162
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,760
Although it's short,

163
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,440
I've never been

164
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,960
disappointed in you,

165
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,800
or fallen in love with you.

166
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,560
I don't care about you at all.

167
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,140
He's the main character in the flower ring.

168
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,560
You don't need to worry this much.

169
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:47,340
Iffl called Yan holidays with his friends,

170
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,860
he'd leave for Beijing without saying goodbye.

171
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,380
This is what ring is?

172
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,180
unexplainable with monster power.

173
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,860
It has no special effect.

174
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:12,560
Miss Cuiyu, you are kind and gentle.

175
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,560
Mr. Mu, after this,

176
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,560
let's meet again.

177
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,560
It's been a long time since we've met.

178
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,560
Let's bet on who will be the last one to bet today.

179
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,560
Bet? It must be Qingmu.

180
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,560
Every time he uses that beauty trick, he will fall asleep until noon.

181
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,560
In the future, the gems used by your Li family will not be a big deal.

182
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,560
Sister Qingmu, you're here.

183
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,560
Little sister.

184
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,560
It's been a long journey. I'm tired.

185
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,560
Thank you.

186
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,560
Brother.

187
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,560
Sister Qingmu is here.

188
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,560
Where are Brother San and Xiaoqi?

189
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,560
That's right.

190
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,560
My brother never gets late.

191
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,560
Brother ordered me and Brother Qi to go to the city to get the evidence.

192
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,560
That's why I'm late. I'm sorry.

193
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,560
Xiaoqi, are you going to the Western Regions to investigate?

194
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,560
Yes.

195
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:59,560
You're so fast.

196
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,560
Am I that close?

197
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,560
Okay, let's get to the point.

198
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,560
Brother Qi, you go first.

199
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,560
What I know about the Western Regions is very similar to what everyone knows.

200
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,560
From the southern spring to Tianmen Pass,

201
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,560
a huge red ditch was formed.

202
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,560
These red ditches formed a huge barrier.

203
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,560
All demons were unable to get in.

204
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,560
It's a circle.

205
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,560
It's a circle drawn by the three of them.

206
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,560
It's a circle that blocks the black fox from going outside.

207
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:30,560
So, what did you see in the end 20 years later?

208
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,560
The golden flag is broken.

209
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,560
The black fox is in trouble.

210
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,560
It will be here forever.

211
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,560
Brother, 20 years later,

212
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,560
the ending of our mask group

213
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,560
will really destroy the whole army.

214
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,560
Brother, I...

215
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,560
I'm still alive.

216
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:55,560
We can change everything from 20 years later to now.

217
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:59,560
Will the future really be changed?

218
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,560
Of course.

219
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,560
The purpose of our mask group

220
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,560
is to break all the rules

221
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,560
and challenge everything that's impossible.

222
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,560
Even if this black fox is in trouble,

223
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,560
I'm not afraid.

224
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,560
We will definitely win.

225
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,560
That's right.

226
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,560
In the future,

227
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,560
we will be able to defeat the evil fox.

228
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,560
We will be able to defeat the evil fox.

229
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,560
We will definitely win.

230
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,560
That's right.

231
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,560
The future is not here yet.

232
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,560
There is still a chance to change.

233
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,560
Everything in the world is in the process of changing.

234
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,560
We have to take a step forward to change.

235
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,560
We have to take a step forward to change.

236
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,560
We have to take a step forward to change.

237
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,560
So we can't be reckless.

238
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,560
We must understand the black fox

239
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,560
and find a way to defeat it.

240
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,560
Isn't it just a fox demon?

241
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,560
Let's split up and investigate.

242
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,560
We can definitely find a flaw.

243
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,560
That's right.

244
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,560
But the problem now is

245
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,560
that everything about the black fox

246
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,560
is already investigated.

247
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,560
That's all.

248
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,560
We will go to the birthplace of the black fox

249
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,560
and investigate the Demon Kingdom.

250
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,560
Demon Kingdom?

251
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,560
The wine warehouse was sealed in the Demon Kingdom.

252
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,560
Jialan also became a black fox in the Demon Kingdom.

253
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,560
Why did the Demon Kingdom do this 500 years ago?

254
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,560
What happened in the underground palace?

255
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,560
What is it?

256
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,560
I'll send someone to the Demon Kingdom.

257
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,560
No, I'll go myself.

258
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,560
Fourth Brother and I

259
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,560
will stay together

260
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,560
and take a picture at any time.

261
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,560
Give me three days.

262
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,560
I'll help you arrange the travel problems in the Demon Kingdom.

263
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,560
Okay.

264
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,560
Just take me.

265
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,560
No problem.

266
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,560
Big Brother has a good taste.

267
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,560
Big Brother.

268
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,560
Here, the hairpin you want.

269
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,560
This is the first time

270
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,560
I've done the same style twice.

271
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,560
Fortunately, you have a big fortune.

272
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,560
Thank you.

273
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,560
This hairpin is good.

274
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,560
Of course.

275
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,560
Of course.

276
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,560
I carefully selected this.

277
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,560
Miss Dongfang,

278
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,560
the things you asked me to investigate

279
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,560
are already in the past.

280
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,560
Before your mother Jiang Junxue married your father,

281
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,560
she was the Saintess of the Northern Mountains Sect.

282
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,560
Northern Mountains Sect?

283
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,560
There is a person

284
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,560
who should know more than I do.

285
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,560
My father.

286
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,560
In order to marry Jiang Junxue,

287
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,560
Dongfang Sect Leader gave up his great future

288
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,560
and retreated to the pugilistic world.

289
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,560
Father.

290
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,560
Zhu'er, come.

291
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,560
Sit with me.

292
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,560
The summer has arrived.

293
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,560
Every night, I can see

294
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,560
so many stars.

295
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,560
Before,

296
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,560
your mother had a problem.

297
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,560
She liked to sit here

298
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,560
and watch the stars.

299
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,560
She liked to take all the things

300
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,560
alone.

301
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,560
Our Zhu'er

302
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,560
is actually the same as you.

303
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,560
Father.

304
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,560
Ever since you came back,

305
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,560
you've been worried.

306
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,560
And this worry

307
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,560
is also related to your mother.

308
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,560
I'm worried about you.

309
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,560
I'm worried about you.

310
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,560
Do you have anything to ask me?

311
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,560
Father.

312
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,560
Do you know where my mother is from?

313
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,560
She's from the Demon Kingdom

314
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,560
of Northern Mountains Sect.

315
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,560
Then why did she come here?

316
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,560
To meet me.

317
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,560
Your mother said

318
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,560
she spent her whole life's luck

319
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,560
to meet me.

320
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,560
I remember

321
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,560
after Qin Lan was born,

322
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,560
she passed away.

323
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,560
At that time,

324
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,560
it was summer.

325
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,560
There were so many stars.

326
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,560
I remember

327
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,560
she told me

328
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,560
to forgive her

329
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,560
for not telling me

330
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,560
all the secrets

331
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,560
and doing so many things

332
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,560
alone.

333
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,560
Why didn't she tell you

334
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,560
and let you face it with her?

335
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,560
She said

336
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,560
the story behind her

337
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,560
was very dark.

338
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,560
She wanted to know her

339
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,560
and leave the day

340
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,560
when people could shine in the east

341
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,560
to you.

342
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,560
I can leave your mother's heart

343
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,560
to you.

344
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,560
My heart?

345
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,560
This is your mother's

346
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,560
handwriting.

347
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,560
She said

348
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,560
she felt guilty.

349
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,560
If one day

350
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,560
you want an answer,

351
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,560
open this letter.

352
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,560
For so many years,

353
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,560
I haven't opened this letter.

354
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,560
Your mother wrote this letter to you.

355
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,560
Why would I read it?

356
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,560
Zhu,

357
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,560
I've been

358
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,560
a wandering woman all my life.

359
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,560
Only when I met your father

360
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,560
did I live like a human.

361
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,560
But as a mother,

362
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,560
I always

363
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,560
feel guilty to you.

364
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,560
If you have the courage to change your fate,

365
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,560
go to the Dream House of the Demon Kingdom

366
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,560
and find a person

367
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,560
named Er Zhu Yu

368
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,560
to get the Xiwu Flower.

369
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,560
By then,

370
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,560
you will get all the answers.

371
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,560
The Saintess of the Northern Mountains

372
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,560
Jiang Xuanxue,

373
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,560
this is your mother's true identity.

374
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,560
Father,

375
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,560
I want to go to the Demon Kingdom

376
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,560
to investigate the whole thing.

377
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,560
Go ahead.

378
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,560
Remember,

379
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,560
there are some questions

380
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,560
that you shouldn't be afraid of.

381
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,560
I don't just want an answer.

382
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,560
I also need to think of a way

383
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,560
to change everything

384
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,560
in twenty years.

385
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,560
You are indeed

386
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,560
the daughter of my East's first son.

387
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,560
The most dreamy

388
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,560
Xiwu Flower.

389
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,560
Junior Sister,

390
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,560
you really have a lot of secrets.

391
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,560
The Demon Kingdom

392
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,560
Jiang Xuanxue

393
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,560
Jiang Xuanxue

394
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,560
Jiang Xuanxue

395
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,560
Jiang Xuanxue

396
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,560
Jiang Xuanxue

397
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,560
Jiang Xuanxue

398
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,560
Jiang Xuanxue

399
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,560
Jiang Xuanxue

400
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,560
Jiang Xuanxue

401
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,560
You are just drinking,

402
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,560
but you are not talking.

403
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:31,560
Then I will guess the old rules first.

404
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,560
The man's.

405
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,560
The mask group's.

406
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,560
The mask group's.

407
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,560
Three drinks.

408
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,560
You know who it is,

409
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,560
but you still ask me to drink it three times.

410
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,560
Your drinking capacity is not a problem even if you drink thirty times.

411
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,560
What?

412
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,560
Did you feel wronged

413
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,560
in his place?

414
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,560
No.

415
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,560
I just feel

416
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,560
that my heart

417
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,560
is like a stone

418
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,560
that is heavy.

419
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,560
Do you feel that way?

420
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,560
Of course.

421
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,560
Is it because of your sister-in-law?

422
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,560
But

423
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,560
as long as I listen to her,

424
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,560
see her smile,

425
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,560
and be with her,

426
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,560
this stone will be gone.

427
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,560
But as long as I separate from her,

428
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,560
this stone

429
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,560
will come back.

430
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,560
Right?

431
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,560
Me too.

432
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,560
I want to learn from her,

433
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,560
but I look forward to

434
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,560
meeting her every day.

435
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,560
A'Zui.

436
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,560
Then you have to learn this from me.

437
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,560
Learn what?

438
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,560
Find the answer,

439
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,560
not wait for it.

440
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,560
How?

441
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,560
Let's think of a way together.

442
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,560
Brother,

443
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,560
the water is deep in the Demon Realm.

444
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,560
Are you sure

445
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,560
that you will take only Brother Yan with you?

446
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,560
It's too noisy.

447
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,560
It's easy to leak the news.

448
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,560
It's a close call.

449
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,560
When I'm not here,

450
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,560
you can decide everything.

451
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,560
And

452
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,560
stay with her

453
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,560
and think about

454
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,560
what she is thinking.

455
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,560
Brother.

456
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,560
Yitan,

457
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,560
you think too much.

458
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,560
You want to do things properly.

459
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,560
It's good.

460
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,560
But you are too hesitant

461
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,560
in your feelings.

462
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,560
Brother,

463
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,560
you should be done talking.

464
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,560
Next,

465
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,560
it's time to talk about our business.

466
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,560
What business?

467
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,560
The talisman is a real talisman.

468
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,560
It will tell the truth after use.

469
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,560
When it is used,

470
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,560
it will be used again.

471
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,560
It's not a good thing.

472
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,560
It's a good thing.

473
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,560
It's a good thing.

474
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,560
It's a good thing.

475
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,560
It will be used again.

476
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,560
It's a good thing.

477
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,560
It will be used again.

478
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,560
It will be used again.

479
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,560
Choose one.

480
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,560
Yang Yi must have feelings for you.

481
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,560
I can see it.

482
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,560
I think I'm right.

483
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,560
Brother Yitan is too hesitant.

484
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,560
We should force him.

485
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,560
There are many ways.

486
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,560
Choose one.

487
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,560
It's hard.

488
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,560
But I can't force him.

489
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,560
Brother Yitan has hurt the foundation in Biluo City.

490
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,560
It's a big thing.

491
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,560
What's wrong with that?

492
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,560
Brother, you have to throw up anyway.

493
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,560
Two together.

494
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,560
Come on.

495
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,560
You are too bright.

496
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,560
Cook the chicken.

497
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,560
Let you know I have to carry that.

498
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,560
Why are you letting me do it?

499
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,560
The continuous dusting

500
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,560
will make you miserable.

501
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,560
I'll take a break once I get a home.

502
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,560
Marry me.

503
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,560
screaming

504
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,560
Marry me.

505
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,560
Mr. Yang,

506
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,320
I've changed.

507
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,720
I also thought

508
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,120
that after 20 years,

509
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:47,740
I'd be alone in the

510
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,600
Please drink another one.

511
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,800
Please drink another one.

512
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,800
Please drink another one.

513
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,000
It's too bitter.

514
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:53,480
Come on.

515
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,280
Cheers.

516
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,120
It's so bitter.

517
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,160
I think

518
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,440
I've drunk

519
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,160
the moon's bottle.

520
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,520
He...

521
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,640
What did he say?

522
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,720
He said the moon is so far away tonight.

523
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,440
Really?

524
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:24,880
Yes.

525
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,160
Yang Yutang.

526
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,960
I just want to ask you

527
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,560
if you like her or not.

528
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:33,480
You...

529
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,800
You're so good at drinking.

530
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,080
You're going to kill me.

531
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,320
What does it have to do

532
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,800
with your drunkness?

533
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,160
But you look

534
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,640
like the first time

535
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,240
I saw her.

536
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,040
The first time you saw her?

537
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,440
I see.

538
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,720
At that time,

539
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,200
she was still young, right?

540
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,000
That day,

541
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,480
it happened to be her family dinner.

542
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,600
She was seven years old.

543
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,800
She drank the rice wine at home.

544
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,400
Then I heard

545
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,840
that I was her only husband.

546
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,840
I couldn't help it.

547
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,840
She chased me and scolded me.

548
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,000
I see.

549
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,000
Then,

550
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,080
she cried.

551
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,440
But she still didn't let go.

552
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,200
She pressed my legs

553
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,000
and said a dream.

554
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,040
She slept all night.

555
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,200
You must hate her.

556
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,400
You...

557
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,920
What's the point of treating me like this?

558
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,960
I mean,

559
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,560
I should

560
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,800
dislike her.

561
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,560
But I don't know why.

562
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,240
After watching her family dinner,

563
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,760
I think she

564
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,680
is普通

565
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,400
and lovely.

566
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,840
I don't feel numb anymore.

567
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:42,840
So you liked her at that time, right?

568
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,840
Yes.

569
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:58,840
I started to like A Zui since then.

570
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,840
I was only nine years old that year.

571
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:07,840
I also found a bamboo forest and found a bamboo to carve words on it.

572
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,840
What words?

573
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,840
What words?

574
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,840
Then why don't you just confess to your sister?

575
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:24,840
If you can't give people a good life,

576
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,840
then you are not qualified to love.

577
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:36,840
So this is why you always push me away.

578
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:41,840
Our A Zui is loved by thousands of people.

579
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:47,840
My current wish is to guard her.

580
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:53,840
To protect her until she meets a suitable man.

581
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:58,840
Jing'er, Sanlin, you think too much.

582
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,840
Let's continue. Don't mind him.

583
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,840
Think about what A Zui wants.

584
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,840
Yitan, you think too much.

585
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,840
You want to do things properly.

586
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:20,840
But you are weak in love.

587
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,840
Yitan.

588
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,840
Brother.

589
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,840
What do you want?

590
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,840
What do you want?

591
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,840
I want to discuss something with you.

592
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,840
Come in.

593
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,840
Brother.

594
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,840
I'll talk here.

595
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,840
I want to propose to my sister.

596
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,840
I hope you can agree.

597
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,840
I've figured it out.

598
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,840
Life is short.

599
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,840
I don't know what will happen next.

600
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,840
My sister has been so good to me.

601
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,840
I really like her.

602
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:21,840
I don't want to let her down.

603
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,840
Does she know?

604
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,840
She doesn't know yet.

605
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,840
You two have been engaged since childhood.

606
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,840
I must bless you.

607
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,840
Thank you, brother.

608
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,840
I'll go prepare now.

609
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,840
Young master Yang.

610
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,840
Young master.

611
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,840
My sister wants to see you.

612
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,840
What's wrong?

613
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,840
What's up?

614
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,840
I want to propose to Yitan.

615
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,840
I don't care if you agree or not.

616
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,840
I want to do it.

617
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,840
Life is short.

618
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,840
Yitan is good to me.

619
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,840
I don't understand it until so many years later.

620
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,840
I don't want her to be disappointed again.

621
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,840
You've decided it.

622
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,840
I have to tell you.

623
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,840
I'm a good daughter.

624
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,840
So you come to inform me?

625
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,840
I've planned it.

626
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,840
I'll propose to her near Ruyi Tower.
