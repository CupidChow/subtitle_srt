The Love by Hypnotic

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The love and hate are both intense and fierce

3
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,800
The clouds and the wind are as distant as the sky and earth

4
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,800
Don't turn back and keep going, life and death are in front of you

5
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:22,600
The love of whom has been through fire and water

6
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,000
is more vast than the universe

7
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,200
Don't turn back and keep going, life and death are in front of you

8
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:35,800
The love of whom has been through fire and water

9
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,600
is more vast than the universe

10
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,200
It's you and me

11
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,200
The Love by Hypnotic

12
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,200
Episode 15

13
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,200
A'Yuan! A'Yuan!

14
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,200
A'Yuan!

15
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,800
Judge Zhang.

16
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,100
Judge Zhang…

17
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:26,520
I made this cup Smack

18
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:34,120
I don't want to say goodbye to you.

19
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,720
A-Yao!

20
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,120
A-Yao!

21
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,320
A-Yao!

22
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,320
A-Yao!

23
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,320
Wu Mei!

24
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,120
A-Yao!

25
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,120
A-Yao!

26
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,120
A-Yao!

27
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,120
A-Yao!

28
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,120
Wu Mei!

29
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,520
The pulse is still weak.

30
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,720
Protect her back to the Ruyi Tower.

31
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,120
Okay.

32
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,120
I need herbs.

33
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,720
Okay.

34
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,720
It's getting dark.

35
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,320
Why haven't they come back yet?

36
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,320
They are so boundless.

37
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,320
If they can't find the antidote,

38
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,920
my... my lady will...

39
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,320
She's always so smart and cautious.

40
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,720
How could she be poisoned by the poison?

41
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,320
What's going on?

42
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:25,920
Nothing.

43
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,520
Then I have to ask you.

44
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,120
The poison of my lady

45
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,920
was passed through you.

46
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,720
You are the star of my lady's life.

47
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,320
What did you say?

48
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,520
Master Zhang,

49
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,320
your evil mother

50
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,120
used the Demon Talisman to control you.

51
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,720
She put the poison of the bird in your body.

52
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,720
My lady went to see you that day.

53
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,720
But you were poisoned and fainted in front of her.

54
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,520
My lady used the poison to herself

55
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,920
to save you.

56
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,120
No wonder the Demon Talisman didn't work on me.

57
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,120
My lady has been

58
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,920
loving you and wanting to see you for years.

59
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,720
You really don't deserve to be so heartless.

60
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,120
Master Zhang,

61
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,920
do you know why my lady

62
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,720
didn't tell you about the poison?

63
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,320
She said you were suffering enough

64
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,720
and didn't want you to be saved.

65
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,320
She didn't want to be the second lock in your heart.

66
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,920
Are you all right?

67
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:24,920
Get out!

68
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,520
Yuan,

69
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,520
since you called me Zhang Dongchuan,

70
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,920
I've been thinking about you.

71
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,120
I've been loving you.

72
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,520
Zhang Dongchuan.

73
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,720
You've recovered.

74
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,920
You can come to school now.

75
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,120
Good morning, Zhang Dongchuan.

76
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,920
I'll go in first.

77
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,520
Okay.

78
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,920
I'm going in.

79
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,920
Good morning,

80
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,520
Yuan.

81
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,520
I made wontons for you.

82
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,720
I'm counting on you.

83
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,520
Try it.

84
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,520
Go.

85
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,920
Zhang Dongchuan.

86
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,720
Where are you going?

87
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,520
Zhang Dongchuan.

88
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,520
Ning Tianqi.

89
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,920
Yuan,

90
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,120
goodbye.

91
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,520
See you again.

92
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,320
Yuan,

93
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,920
let's not say goodbye

94
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,120
until we get back to that day.

95
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,520
All these years,

96
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,120
I've been hiding from you

97
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,720
and avoiding you.

98
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,120
I've been practicing hard

99
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,920
to become the so-called world's number one.

100
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,520
I thought I was like a rock.

101
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,520
But actually, I've engraved your name in my heart.

102
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,920
Please, boss.

103
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,920
I'm willing to do it.

104
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,920
No matter how many people are in the way,

105
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,520
no one has ever changed.

106
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,520
Do you know why?

107
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,320
Because I'll always be behind you.

108
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,720
I won't let anyone hurt you.

109
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,520
In fact, you are always

110
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,000
I'll visit you

111
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,640
for the rest of my life.

112
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,560
My favorite food in this life is wontons.

113
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,160
Wake up.

114
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,880
Give me another chance, okay?

115
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,620
Schnuck bread

116
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,120
Sister,

117
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,440
The medicine is almost complete.

118
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,960
we should get a medical

119
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,720
sealed Bio shotgun can inc XD

120
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,480
Sure

121
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,440
Yanyan and Quzhou

122
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,000
must be able to

123
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,440
Flora Baurut

124
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:40,800
It is Ớn

125
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,120
You're awake.

126
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,080
My poison

127
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,560
has been cured.

128
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,280
Huai Zhu and Hong Yan

129
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,840
brought the antidote for you.

130
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,440
Where are my brother and sister-in-law?

131
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,840
They're afraid it'll affect your rest.

132
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,000
They said they'd come to see you tomorrow.

133
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,760
You're so bitter.

134
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,560
The medicine is bitter?

135
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,120
How about I ask him to take the medicine next time?

136
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,000
Don't be so bitter.

137
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,160
Please bring the secret sword

138
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,840
to the table, Master Zhang.

139
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,200
Okay.

140
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,360
And

141
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,920
bring the mirror, too.

142
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,160
Okay.

143
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:17,760
And

144
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,240
here are父

145
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,200
You look so ugly.

146
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,440
You're losing weight.

147
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,080
I lost weight.

148
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,800
You've avoided one point this time.

149
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,560
You can't lose weight again.

150
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,880
I can't speak.

151
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,600
How about

152
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,240
you tell me?

153
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm tired.

154
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,280
Let's go to bed early.

155
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,040
No.

156
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,680
I want to hear you speak.

157
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,120
What should I say?

158
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,600
Your voice is nice.

159
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,520
You can say whatever you want.

160
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,160
I'll recite the Heart-wrenching Spell for you.

161
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,160
Wish you a good night's sleep.

162
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,320
I'll read it for you.

163
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,520
I'll read it for you.

164
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,520
I'll read it for you.

165
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,480
I'll read it for you.

166
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,520
I'll read it for you.

167
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,600
I'll read it for you.

168
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,440
Wish you a good night's sleep.

169
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,440
No.

170
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,920
I'm your savior now.

171
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,040
How do you want to repay me?

172
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,880
You can repay me in any way you want.

173
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,200
Zhang Zheng.

174
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,960
Listen.

175
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,400
I like you.

176
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,200
I don't need any repayment from you.

177
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,760
You're the best in my heart.

178
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,280
You don't owe anyone.

179
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,600
You've done a good job.

180
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,080
Do you understand?

181
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,600
Do you understand me or not?

182
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,200
I won't be like this anymore.

183
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,240
Don't worry.

184
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,280
I'll be with you forever.

185
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,400
No matter if you're annoying or disgusted with me,

186
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,840
I'll be with you forever.

187
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,760
Yuanyuan!

188
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,000
Yuanyuan.

189
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,840
In my whole life,

190
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,600
I've got only one of you.

191
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,040
Got anything?

192
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,600
Ah, the shadow is drifting away

193
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,600
In this life, I can only rely on you

194
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,600
Let the flowers bloom

195
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,600
Our days

196
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,600
What's so happy that you can't sleep?

197
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,600
Bu Mu has become the new king of the Mages

198
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,600
He asked us to go to the underground palace tomorrow

199
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,600
It's a good thing

200
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,600
What are you doing?

201
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,600
I am not interested

202
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,600
Oh, that's right

203
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,600
Qu Zhuo has taught me something

204
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,600
Qu Zhuo teaches you?

205
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,600
He said

206
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,600
Wait

207
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,600
There seems to be something

208
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,420
Don't worry.

209
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,680
Is that what Qu Zhuo taught you?

210
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,860
Then I'll go and ask her.

211
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,860
You have to ask her now.

212
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,860
She will definitely admit it.

213
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,260
You failed.

214
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,860
You failed in the long-lost disaster.

215
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,860
This time, it's really my uncle's fire.

216
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:53,860
Uncle's fire?

217
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,860
They should have only one destiny.

218
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,860
That is to be stuck to my feet.

219
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,860
But because of your uncle's fire,

220
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,860
not only did Dongfang Huai Zhu get the West Martial Arts Flower,

221
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,860
but also let Wang Quan Hongye have the power to destroy me.

222
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,860
If you were still a powerful Jiu Guo,

223
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,860
all of this wouldn't have happened.

224
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,860
You would have destroyed them all at once,

225
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,860
instead of hiding in this Bilo City

226
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,860
and being helpless to them.

227
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,860
The time is running out.

228
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,860
I will think of a way

229
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:30,860
to break the connection between the Black-hearted Love Book and the Bilo Book

230
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,860
so that you can get the power of the Bilo Book.

231
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,860
But...

232
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,860
But you are already very weak.

233
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,860
This mistake will be very effective against the power of the demon.

234
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,860
As long as you can come back,

235
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,860
I will do whatever I can.

236
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:53,860
I'm sorry.

237
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,860
Forgive me for being angry with you before.

238
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,860
I really can't bear to see you so weak

239
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,860
and be confused when you care about me.

240
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,860
After all,

241
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:06,860
you are the Jiu Guo I care about the most.

242
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:08,860
Tell me.

243
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,860
Are you still waiting for me?

244
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,860
What are you talking about?

245
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,860
I promise you.

246
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,860
I will definitely bring you back.

247
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,860
Okay.

248
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,860
I believe you.

249
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,860
Lord Jiu Guo,

250
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,860
remember.

251
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,860
We can never lose again.

252
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,860
I'm sorry.

253
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:05,860
You have been coming to the Sky Mountain for so many years.

254
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,860
You have been coming to the Sky Mountain for so many years.

255
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,860
You have been coming to the Sky Mountain for so many years.

256
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,860
You have been coming to the Sky Mountain for so many years.

257
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,860
You have been coming to the Sky Mountain for so many years.

258
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,860
You have been coming to the Sky Mountain for so many years.

259
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,860
You have been coming to the Sky Mountain for so many years.

260
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,860
You have been coming to the Sky Mountain for so many years.

261
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,860
You have been coming to the Sky Mountain for so many years.

262
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,860
You have been coming to the Sky Mountain for so many years.

263
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,860
You have been coming to the Sky Mountain for so many years.

264
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,860
You have been coming to the Sky Mountain for so many years.

265
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,860
You have been coming to the Sky Mountain for so many years.

266
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,860
You have been coming to the Sky Mountain for so many years.

267
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,860
You have been coming to the Sky Mountain for so many years.

268
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:35,860
I...

269
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:41,860
You lost again.

270
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:46,860
I...

271
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:04,860
I'm not.

272
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,260
Jia Lan.

273
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,460
You want to control me?

274
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,460
I don't.

275
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,860
Lord Jiuhuo is so powerful.

276
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,260
How can I control you?

277
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,460
But you've really made a lot of progress this time.

278
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,660
I have a gift for you.

279
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,660
What gift?

280
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,060
Little fox?

281
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,460
Yes.

282
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,260
Lord Jiuhuo.

283
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,460
I've prepared a gift for you.

284
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,660
Do you want to see it?

285
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,660
Let's go.

286
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,460
Let's go.

287
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,460
It's beautiful and strange.

288
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,060
It's really a little strange.

289
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,060
Dairou, look.

290
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,060
Actually, I've been asking myself

291
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,860
when I fell in love with Jia Lan.

292
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:39,660
It's from the moment she grew up.

293
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,260
Since you like it,

294
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:48,860
I'll give her the most beautiful moment.

295
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,260
Do you like it?

296
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,660
Or when she used this cruel way

297
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,860
to keep the beauty for me,

298
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,660
or...

299
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,260
Lord Jiuhuo.

300
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,660
I'm sorry.

301
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,260
I'm sorry.

302
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,260
I'm sorry.

303
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,260
What's wrong?

304
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:37,260
The dragon clan and my imperial family are enemies.

305
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,260
Recently, I've been breaking the rules.

306
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,660
I've broken their dragon clan's old city.

307
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:46,460
You've broken their old city by yourself?

308
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,060
The real dragon clan has been destroyed.

309
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:52,060
It's a pity that the dragon king stole it.

310
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,460
My lord.

311
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,660
I'm a little tired.

312
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,460
I want to rest for a while.

313
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,460
My lord, the elixir is broken.

314
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,660
The fire of the Yi River never stops.

315
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:29,660
It's been on my mind for three days and nights.

316
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,860
I've been thinking about it.

317
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:32,860
I've been thinking about it.

318
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,860
I've been thinking about it.

319
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:34,860
I've been thinking about it.

320
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,860
I've been thinking about it.

321
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:36,860
I've been thinking about it.

322
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:37,860
I've been thinking about it.

323
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:38,860
I've been thinking about it.

324
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,860
I've been thinking about it.

325
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:40,860
I've been thinking about it.

326
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,860
I've been thinking about it.

327
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:42,860
I've been thinking about it.

328
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:43,860
I've been thinking about it.

329
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:44,860
I've been thinking about it.

330
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:45,860
I've been thinking about it.

331
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,860
I've been thinking about it.

332
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,860
I've been thinking about it.

333
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,860
I've been thinking about it.

334
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:49,860
I've been thinking about it.

335
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:50,860
I've been thinking about it.

336
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:51,860
I've been thinking about it.

337
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:52,860
I've been thinking about it.

338
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:53,860
I've been thinking about it.

339
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,860
I've been thinking about it.

340
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:56,860
I've been thinking about it.

341
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:57,860
I've been thinking about it.

342
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:58,860
I've been thinking about it.

343
00:24:58,860 --> 00:24:59,860
I've been thinking about it.

344
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,860
I've been thinking about it.

345
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:01,860
I've been thinking about it.

346
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:02,860
I've been thinking about it.

347
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:03,860
I've been thinking about it.

348
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:04,860
I've been thinking about it.

349
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:05,860
I've been thinking about it.

350
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:06,860
I've been thinking about it.

351
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:07,860
I've been thinking about it.

352
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,860
I've been thinking about it.

353
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:09,860
I've been thinking about it.

354
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:10,860
I've been thinking about it.

355
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:11,860
I've been thinking about it.

356
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:12,860
I've been thinking about it.

357
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:13,860
I've been thinking about it.

358
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:14,860
I've been thinking about it.

359
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:15,860
I've been thinking about it.

360
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:16,860
I've been thinking about it.

361
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:17,860
I've been thinking about it.

362
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:18,860
I've been thinking about it.

363
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:19,860
I've been thinking about it.

364
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:20,860
Jialan.

365
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:24,860
Lord Jiuhe.

366
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,860
Look.

367
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,860
This is...

368
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,860
This is Longhuang's.

369
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,860
I picked up his dragon egg.

370
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:37,860
It's still warm.

371
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,860
Give it to Lord Jiuhe first.

372
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,860
You think I...

373
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,860
...have a dragon egg?

374
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:55,860
I said...

375
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,860
...whoever gets hurt by Lord Jiuhe...

376
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,860
...must die.

377
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,860
Jialan.

378
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,860
Jialan.

379
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:09,860
It's still...

380
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,860
Jialan.

381
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:13,860
Jialan.

382
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:15,860
Jialan.

383
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,860
Jialan.

384
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:19,860
Jialan.

385
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,860
From the moment he took my dragon egg.

386
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:42,260
If I can be the

387
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:46,860
The sunset and the rainbow today

388
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,860
aren't they beautiful?

389
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,860
I don't like the sunset and the rainbow.

390
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:51,860
Isn't the night good?

391
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,860
Only the night is eternal.

392
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,860
Your power has recovered.

393
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:08,860
The dragon egg's power

394
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:09,860
has been repaired by my elixir.

395
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,860
Our Jialan has worked hard.

396
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:15,860
Lord.

397
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,860
Can I get a reward?

398
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:19,860
Sure.

399
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:22,860
I'll go and get it.

400
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:27,860
Lord Jiuhe has not

401
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,860
combed your hair for a long time.

402
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,860
Why did you go to the dragon egg without permission?

403
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,860
Jialan likes strong people.

404
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,860
Anyone who is in front of Lord Jiuhe

405
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:46,860
must die.

406
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,860
What if one day

407
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:50,860
I'm not strong anymore?

408
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:53,860
Will you also treat me

409
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,860
like a butterfly

410
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:56,860
and let me die

411
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:57,860
at the most beautiful moment?

412
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,860
How could Lord Jiuhe

413
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:11,860
die?

414
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:20,860
You put on

415
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,860
the last real hair in the world.

416
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,860
No one will let you go.

417
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:27,860
So what?

418
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,860
Right.

419
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:33,860
So what?

420
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,860
If someone dares to object,

421
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:39,860
kill him.

422
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:40,860
It's okay.

423
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,860
In fact, at some point,

424
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,860
when I found that in this world,

425
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:52,860
there was another life

426
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:53,860
as dangerous as me,

427
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,860
when it entered my world,

428
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:58,860
we

429
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,860
were inseparable.

430
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,860
Even if I was broken,

431
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,860
I would do what I said.

432
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,860
I will also protect you.

433
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:12,860
When you come back,

434
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,860
I will play with you.

435
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:17,860
Is that okay?

436
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,860
Congratulations to the king for becoming the king.

437
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,860
I know

438
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:42,860
that the Yiqi Alliance

439
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,860
should not interfere

440
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:44,860
in the affairs of the Yuyao Kingdom.

441
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:46,860
But Bumu,

442
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,860
you know the demon clan.

443
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:49,860
You should understand my feelings.

444
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:51,860
The demons of the Yuyao Kingdom

445
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:52,860
are too cruel.

446
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:54,860
I hope

447
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:55,860
they can have a day of freedom.

448
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:57,860
And you become the king,

449
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:59,860
maybe this day

450
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:01,860
will really come.

451
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:09,860
I have no plans for the Yuyao Kingdom.

452
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,860
I will never do anything

453
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:13,860
that is not good for the Yuyao Kingdom

454
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:14,860
in this secret room.

455
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:16,860
I just want to know

456
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,860
where the black fox comes from.

457
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:30,860
I believe you.

458
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:32,860
When the secret room is opened,

459
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,860
the king's seal is the only key.

460
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:46,860
Follow me.

461
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:54,860
Only the king

462
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:55,860
can enter this secret room.

463
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:57,860
Look.

464
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,860
The name on the wall

465
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:00,860
is recorded

466
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:01,860
the history of the Yuyao Kingdom.

467
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:03,860
Among them,

468
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:04,860
the origin of the Yuyao Talisman is also included.

469
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:08,860
The people in this painting

470
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:10,860
are all the same.

471
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:12,860
The people in this painting

472
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:13,860
are all the same.

473
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,860
Are the people in this painting

474
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:16,860
Jialan and Jiuhuo?

475
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:19,860
No wonder Jiuhuo

476
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,860
didn't want to remember

477
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,860
what happened here.

478
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:24,860
Jiuhuo got the dragon elixir.

479
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,860
She should have been invincible.

480
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:27,860
But she was not surprised

481
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:28,860
that the ancestors of Beishan

482
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,860
dug up the two dragon's sea

483
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:32,860
and used resentment to counteract her.

484
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,860
They used a very cruel way

485
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:36,860
to trap her.

486
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,860
Jiuhuo.

487
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:03,860
Jiuhuo.

488
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:09,860
Jialan.

489
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:11,860
You are late.

490
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:12,860
Who told you to come?

491
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:14,860
Go.

492
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:21,860
Don't worry.

493
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:25,860
Let's go together.

494
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:28,860
Jialan.

495
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:42,860
Jiuhuo.

496
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:44,860
Jiuhuo.

497
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:46,860
Jiuhuo.

498
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:48,860
Jiuhuo.

499
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:50,860
Jiuhuo.

500
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:52,860
Jiuhuo.

501
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:54,860
Jiuhuo.

502
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:56,860
Jiuhuo.

503
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:58,860
Jiuhuo.

504
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:00,860
Jiuhuo.

505
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:02,860
Jiuhuo.

506
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:04,860
Jiuhuo.

507
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:06,860
Jiuhuo.

508
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,860
Jiuhuo.

509
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,860
Jiuhuo.

510
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:12,860
Jiuhuo.

511
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:39,860
What a couple

512
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:43,860
It's a pity that none of you can leave today.

513
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,860
Who are you?

514
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,860
Let me introduce myself.

515
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:50,860
I am the Chief of the Jade Demon Kingdom.

516
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:53,860
This is the rare and rare

517
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,860
Talented Master Fu Wen of the Formation.

518
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,860
The Tower of Mount North.

519
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,860
Do you like this place?

520
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:06,860
This place is specially prepared

521
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,860
for you.

522
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,860
It's you?

523
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,860
Jialang.

524
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:15,860
How dare you treat Lord Jiuhuo like this?

525
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,860
You will all die today.

526
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,860
Jialang!

527
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,860
Jialang!

528
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:50,860
Lord Jiuhuo!

529
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,860
Go!

530
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:54,860
Go!

531
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,860
Lord Jiuhuo!

532
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,860
Jialang!

533
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,860
Jialang!

534
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:06,860
I am a talented and talented master.

535
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,860
To capture you,

536
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:11,860
I will bury tens of thousands of demons in this pit.

537
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,860
Then I will use the blood of the demons

538
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:16,860
that you killed to break the formation.

539
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,860
Little fox,

540
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,860
even if you can climb the dragon,

541
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:26,860
you can't break through this formation.

542
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,860
Jialang!

543
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,860
Jialang!

544
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,860
Jialang!

545
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,860
Jialang!

546
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,860
Jialang!

547
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,860
Jialang!

548
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,860
Jialang!

549
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:48,860
Jialang!

550
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,860
Jialang!

551
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,860
Jialang!

552
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,860
Jialang!

553
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,860
Jialang!

554
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,860
Jialang!

555
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,860
Jialang!

556
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,860
Jialang!

557
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,860
Jialang!

558
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,860
Jialang!

559
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,860
I won't let you off!

560
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,860
The fire of the spirit,

561
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:24,860
we will use the evil fox as a trap

562
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:27,860
to exchange the power of the demons!

563
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,860
Jialang!

564
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,860
Jialang!

565
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,860
Jialang!

566
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,860
Someone!

567
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:01,860
No!

568
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,860
No!

569
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,860
Jialang!

570
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,860
No!

571
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,860
Sir!

572
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,860
No!

573
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,860
No!

574
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,860
Sir!

575
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,860
Sir!

576
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,860
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

577
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,860
The evil fox has been captured.

578
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,860
The evil fox has been captured.

579
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,860
Your Majesty, you can

580
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,860
take the world with the evil fox.

581
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,860
I...

582
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,860
I killed the little witch

583
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,860
who could destroy the netherworld

584
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,860
as the native prophecy said.

585
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,860
I'm doing justice for the heaven.

586
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,860
The power of the evil fox

587
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:54,860
is the reward

588
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:58,860
from the heavens.

589
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,860
You all...

590
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:03,860
You all will die!

591
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,860
Your Majesty,

592
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,860
please forgive me.

593
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,860
I couldn't

594
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:36,860
go back to the mountain with you

595
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,860
this time.

596
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,860
Your Majesty,

597
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,860
I'm sorry.

598
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:50,860
I'm sorry.

599
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,860
I'm sorry.

600
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,860
I'm sorry.

601
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,860
I'm sorry.

602
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,860
I'm sorry.

603
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,860
I'm sorry.

604
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:02,860
I'm sorry.

605
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,860
I'm sorry.

606
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,860
I'm sorry.

607
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,860
I'm sorry.

608
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,860
I'm sorry.

609
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,860
I'm sorry.

610
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,860
I'm sorry.

611
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,860
I'm sorry.

612
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,860
I'm sorry.

613
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,860
I'm sorry.

614
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,860
I'm sorry.

615
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:24,860
I'm sorry.

616
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:28,860
How can I stop

617
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,860
the wind and clouds?

618
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:38,880
The

619
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,880
sky is clear

620
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,880
and the moon is bright.

621
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,880
How can I stop

622
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,880
the wind and clouds?

623
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,880
How can I stop

624
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,880
the wind and clouds?

625
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,880
The wind blows and the moon falls.

626
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,900
I look back

627
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,900
and forget the way back.

628
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,900
I'm lost

629
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:59,900
and I can't find

630
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:02,900
the way back.

631
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,900
The moon looks back

632
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,900
and looks back at me.

633
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,900
I have a long and long

634
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:13,900
longing for you.

635
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:16,900
The sky is full of your tenderness.

636
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,900
I can see it

637
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,900
when I look up.

638
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:21,920
I have a long and long

639
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,920
longing for you.

640
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,920
The stars are bright.

641
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,920
I fall in love with you.

642
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,120
You are like a thousand

643
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:35,120
and ten thousand times.

644
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,120
If I can

645
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,120
see you again,

646
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,120
I'd rather

647
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,120
forget the past.

648
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,120
I'm willing to

649
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:46,120
sacrifice myself

650
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,120
for you.

651
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,120
I can only look at you

652
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,120
and have no regrets.

653
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,120
I can only love you

654
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,120
and look at you

655
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,120
in the same light.

656
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,120
The wind is blowing

657
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,120
and the moon is bright.

658
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,120
I feel so lonely.

659
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:06,120
How can I stop

660
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,120
the wind and clouds?

661
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,120
I'm lost

662
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,120
and I can't find

663
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,120
the way back.

664
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,120
I have a long and long

665
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,120
longing for you.

666
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,620
The stars are bright.

667
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,620
I'm willing to give up my life for you.

668
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:23,620
Even if we meet again in the next life,

669
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:25,620
I can't keep our past.

670
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:27,620
It's like a dream.

671
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,620
If we meet again in the next life,

672
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:31,620
I will...
