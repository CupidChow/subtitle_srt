Episode 9

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,840
Love is like a flame

3
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:11,600
The clouds are like the wind, the sky is like the sky

4
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,960
Don't turn back, keep walking

5
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,760
Life and death are in front of you

6
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,280
From the fire to the fire

7
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:25,080
Whose love is more beautiful than the universe

8
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,280
Don't turn back, keep walking

9
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,120
Life and death are in front of you

10
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,600
From the fire to the fire

11
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:38,560
Whose love is more beautiful than the universe

12
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,560
It's me

13
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,560
The Long Ballad

14
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,560
Episode 1

15
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,760
N Noble Consort

16
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,600
Jingyan

17
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,600
I'll take you to find Zhang Zheng.

18
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,600
Yuan.

19
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,600
Yuan.

20
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,600
Yuan.

21
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,600
Yuan.

22
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,600
Yuan.

23
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,600
Yuan.

24
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,600
Yuan.

25
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,600
What?

26
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,600
You don't know whose tomb this is?

27
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,600
You forgot that you buried it yourself.

28
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,600
You took everything from her.

29
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,600
Her identity, her reputation,

30
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,600
and even her most beloved woman.

31
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,600
You won't let go of them.

32
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,600
Your heart is really vicious.

33
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,600
What you said is not true.

34
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,600
It's not true.

35
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,600
Look.

36
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,600
Your crime has been engraved on this tombstone.

37
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
It's you.

38
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,600
You killed her.

39
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,600
I killed her.

40
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,600
You really think that you're the one Qingmu Yuan loves?

41
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,600
She's such a good person.

42
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,600
You actually killed her.

43
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,600
You tried your best to become her.

44
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,600
But you're always a dirty, lowly stray dog.

45
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,600
Only the way back to darkness is your only way out.

46
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,600
Han Naran, be yourself.

47
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,600
I'm sorry.

48
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,600
The Black Sword is made of strength.

49
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,600
Forget all the love and hate.

50
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,600
Kill them all with me.

51
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,600
I'm sorry.

52
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,600
Han Naran, kill them with me.

53
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,600
Young Master has been in chaos all his life.

54
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,600
He's been acting like a fool.

55
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,600
He won't blame me.

56
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,600
If I kill him,

57
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,600
he'll be the one who will be punished.

58
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,600
I'm sorry.

59
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,600
I'm sorry.

60
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,600
I'm sorry.

61
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,600
I'm sorry.

62
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,600
I'm sorry.

63
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,600
I'm sorry.

64
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,600
I'm sorry.

65
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,600
I'm sorry.

66
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,600
And I...

67
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,600
I've never been anyone.

68
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,600
A gentleman should be like a basket.

69
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,600
I, Zhang Zheng,

70
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,600
will never be your enemy.

71
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,600
You're so stupid.

72
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,600
You want to fight me?

73
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,600
Look who I've brought.

74
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,600
Yuan.

75
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,600
Yuan.

76
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,600
Yuan, wake up.

77
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,600
A dirty and lowly stray dog

78
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,600
is still dreaming of a surprising person.

79
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,600
Qing Mu Yuan, kill him.

80
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,600
Zhang Tong Chuan.

81
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,600
Zhang Tong Chuan.

82
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,600
Zhang Zheng,

83
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,600
it's the best custom for you

84
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,600
to die in the hands of Qing Mu Yuan.

85
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,600
As long as you're dead,

86
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,600
Qing Mu Yuan's heart

87
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,600
will always be in the dark.

88
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,600
Zhang Tong Chuan,

89
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,600
I don't want to

90
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,600
say goodbye to you.

91
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,600
I'm sorry.

92
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,600
Yuan.

93
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,600
Yuan.

94
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,600
Yuan.

95
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,600
Yuan.

96
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,600
Yuan.

97
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,600
Yuan.

98
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,600
Yuan.

99
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,600
Yuan.

100
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,600
Yuan.

101
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,600
Yuan.

102
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,600
Yuan.

103
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,600
I'll take you out.

104
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,600
Don't be afraid.

105
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,600
I'll take you out.

106
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,600
Don't be afraid.

107
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,600
I'll take you out.

108
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,600
I'll take you out.

109
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,600
Don't be afraid.

110
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,600
I'll take you out.

111
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,600
When I was young,

112
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,600
I was always like this.

113
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,600
I like...

114
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,600
What do you like?

115
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,600
I like Qing Mu Yuan.

116
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,600
I like you.

117
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,600
I like you.

118
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,600
I like you.

119
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,600
I like you.

120
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,600
I like you.

121
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,600
I like you.

122
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,600
I like you.

123
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,600
I like you.

124
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,600
I like you.

125
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,600
I like you.

126
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,600
I like you.

127
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,600
I like you.

128
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,600
I like you.

129
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,600
I like you.

130
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,600
I like you.

131
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,600
I like you.

132
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,600
I like you.

133
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,600
I like you.

134
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,600
Xiaodao.

135
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,600
You...

136
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,600
You...

137
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,600
You...

138
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,600
Xiaodao...

139
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,600
You call me more rarely.

140
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,600
Xiaodao...

141
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,600
I've been waiting for this moment for so long...

142
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,600
for so long.

143
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,600
So, I choose to become closer to you.

144
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,600
I can't be controlled by him anymore.

145
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:13,600
We will win.

146
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,600
Right?

147
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,600
I can't see it.

148
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,600
Qingyuan, you even killed Zhangzhang.

149
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,600
What else is worth your longing in this world?

150
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,600
You will destroy the world with me,

151
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
the one who killed the others of the Masked Group.

152
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,600
What?

153
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,600
Even you want to fight?

154
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,600
Today, I, Qing Mu Yuan, will fight against you with my life.

155
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,600
Tang Bi is destined to be destroyed.

156
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,600
You actually use your life to fight.

157
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,600
Don't you want to live?

158
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,600
You don't have any value to die.

159
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,600
You are worthless.

160
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,600
Idiot.

161
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,600
Chang Dongcheng.

162
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,600
I'm coming.

163
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,660
My eyes look ridiculous, don't know how to handle it

164
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:54,880
Shao нам, million-dollar

165
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,940
Do you not know how to do it?

166
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,000
Because I can't tell you

167
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,180
Who?

168
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,640
That teacher

169
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,940
He was teaching me

170
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:06,500
when I want to work

171
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,340
Ha say

172
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,220
Yua Huan

173
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,060
Qing Spieler

174
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,700
why?

175
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,340
I aí't told

176
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,280
Ba wa

177
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,240
You kinda

178
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,240
I won't forget your kindness.

179
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,240
Brother, where are we?

180
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,240
Why are we here?

181
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,240
Have you found everyone's positions?

182
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,240
Yes.

183
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,240
It should be this way.

184
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,240
Qu Zhuo, what are you doing?

185
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,240
I'm coming.

186
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,240
Qu Zhuo, be careful!

187
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,240
Brother!

188
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,240
Brother!

189
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,240
Brother!

190
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,240
Brother!

191
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,240
Brother!

192
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,240
Brother!

193
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,240
Demon! Where is my brother?

194
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,240
Your brother is trapped in another fantasy like you.

195
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,240
You'd better be yourself.

196
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:11,240
Li Zicai, don't resist.

197
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,240
You must die here today.

198
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:24,240
Li Qu Zhuo, how was your brother's magic weapon?

199
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,240
Your magic weapon is perfect.

200
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,240
It's amazing.

201
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,240
It's not as perfect as your Purple-Gold Fox.

202
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,240
My brother's magic weapon is the best in the world.

203
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,240
Li Zicai won the world in magic weapon.

204
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,240
He chose the talisman.

205
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,240
Is it because he likes you?

206
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,240
Li Qu Zhuo, you joined the mask troupe secretly.

207
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,240
You're a hero.

208
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,240
But do you really have the ability to save others?

209
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,240
You almost died in Luo Cha's hands.

210
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,240
Have you forgotten?

211
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,240
Xiao Si, are you done?

212
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,240
Here they are.

213
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,240
Move aside.

214
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,240
Qu Zhuo.

215
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,240
Qu Zhuo.

216
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,240
What's wrong?

217
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,240
Brother, I...

218
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:26,240
I dare to fight alone in Luo Cha's team.

219
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,240
I dare to fight alone in Luo Cha's team.

220
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,240
Luo Cha's team?

221
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:47,240
Li Qu Zhuo, do you know who took care of the heroes in the secret factory?

222
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,240
Do you know what price he paid for it?

223
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,240
What price?

224
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,240
Tell me.

225
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:16,240
Give me the antidote, or I'll kill you and save Xuegu.

226
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,240
Your brother must die after killing me.

227
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,240
It's like losing your family.

228
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,240
How can you save him?

229
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,240
If you want to save your brother,

230
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,240
you have to exchange your most precious thing.

231
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,240
Li family's eldest son, the magic treasure, is the champion of the world.

232
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,240
Your most precious thing

233
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,240
should be this hand.

234
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,240
Your brother exchanged his right hand for your life.

235
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,240
His life's favorite thing is the magic treasure.

236
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,240
He gave up everything he wanted.

237
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,240
How painful is he?

238
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:11,240
Li Quzhuo, you really deserve to die.

239
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,240
Li Quzhuo, you only drag others down.

240
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,240
What's the use of keeping a useless person like you?

241
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:34,240
What's the use of keeping a useless person like me?

242
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,240
Li Quzhuo, your brother exchanged his right hand for you.

243
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,240
Shouldn't you give him back something?

244
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,240
Yes.

245
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,240
I owe my brother.

246
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,240
I'll exchange it.

247
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,240
Li Quzhuo, you deserve to die.

248
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,240
Quzhuo, wake up.

249
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,240
Brother.

250
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,240
Quzhuo.

251
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,240
Li Quzhuo.

252
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,240
Li Zijian, you want to protect your brother all your life.

253
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,240
Today you will see him die in front of you.

254
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,240
Brother.

255
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,240
Brother, Quzhuo.

256
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,240
Brother.

257
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,240
Quzhuo.

258
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,240
My leg.

259
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,240
Quzhuo.

260
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,240
I will take you out.

261
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,240
Brother.

262
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:36,240
Li Zizai, do you think you still have a way to live?

263
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,240
Can you still take your disabled brother out?

264
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,240
You dream.

265
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:47,240
You just die here with your useless brother.

266
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,240
Brother.

267
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,240
I lost.

268
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,240
My brother.

269
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,240
No one can do it.

270
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,240
Just like your brother.

271
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,240
Brother.

272
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,240
Brother.

273
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:52,240
Did you say that the world is like the sun and the air is like the clouds?

274
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,240
People are the air of the heaven and the earth.

275
00:27:55,240 --> 00:28:00,240
If you can practice all your spells,

276
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:07,240
then we can beat him with the world.

277
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,240
What are you talking about?

278
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,240
Brother.

279
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,240
Brother, you must live.

280
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:27,240
I said I can protect you.

281
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,240
Anyway, I am disabled.

282
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,240
It's no fun to get out.

283
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:47,240
Today, you and I will use the power of the world to beat him.

284
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:57,240
I won't let you doubt the world.

285
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,240
What are you doing?

286
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,240
Brother, pull.

287
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:10,240
One, two, three.

288
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,240
Three, ten thousand things.

289
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,240
Ten thousand things.

290
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,240
One, two, three.

291
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,240
The spirit of the world is so strong.

292
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:28,240
Do you think you can hurt me by breaking your spirit?

293
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,240
Stupid.

294
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:53,240
The flower and the sun are like the sun and the air is like the clouds.

295
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,240
The world is like the stars.

296
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,240
Brother, go.

297
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,240
Ji'er.

298
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,240
Ji'er.

299
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,240
Ji'er.

300
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,240
Ji'er.

301
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,240
Ji'er.

302
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,240
Ji'er.

303
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,240
Ji'er.

304
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,240
Ji'er.

305
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,240
Ji'er.

306
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,240
Ji'er.

307
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,240
Ji'er.

308
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,240
Ji'er.

309
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,240
Ji'er.

310
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,240
Ji'er.

311
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,240
Ji'er.

312
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,240
Ji'er.

313
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,240
Ji'er.

314
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,240
Ji'er.

315
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,240
Ji'er.

316
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,240
Ji'er.

317
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,240
Ji'er.

318
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,240
Ji'er.

319
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,240
Ji'er.

320
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,240
Ji'er.

321
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,240
Ji'er.

322
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,240
Practicing martial art.

323
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,240
Eye contact, eye contact.

324
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,240
seconds apart

325
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,240
The ship is complete.

326
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:07,240
I yuan don't think too much of you.

327
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:13,240
I still want to know how was to fall.

328
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,240
Deutsch.

329
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:22,240
Did the Demon of Nuocha make things difficult for you?

330
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,240
It was indeed Lu Mang.

331
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:30,240
But if there wasn't a hero like you in the world,

332
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:36,240
I'm afraid that old young man in the village would have died long ago.

333
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,240
But...

334
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,240
He only lost some magic treasures and blessings.

335
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,240
Our Li family has a big family and a big family.

336
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,240
And what is your brother?

337
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,240
A mere demon can't be compared to me.

338
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,240
Really?

339
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,240
Did I swear that you would join the Masked Troupe with me?

340
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:11,240
I, Li Quzhuo, swear that I will never leave this life-saving talisman with you.

341
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,240
How is it? Am I very smart?

342
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,240
Life-saving talisman.

343
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,240
I guessed it right!

344
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:26,240
This isn't a life-saving talisman.

345
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,240
It's a life-changing talisman.

346
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,240
Silly brother.

347
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,240
You should protect this world yourself.

348
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,240
Fine.

349
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,240
I'll protect you.

350
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,240
Brother.

351
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,240
Brother!

352
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,240
Brother!

353
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,240
Life-saving talisman?

354
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,240
Sixth Brother!

355
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,240
My brother's finger print?

356
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,240
Listen to what my brother wants to say.

357
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,240
Brother!

358
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:13,240
Stop it, Brother! What's wrong with you?

359
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,240
I'm fine.

360
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,240
I'm fine.

361
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,240
I'm fine.

362
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,240
I'm fine.

363
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,240
I'm fine.

364
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,240
I'm fine.

365
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,240
I'm fine.

366
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,240
I'm fine.

367
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,240
I'm fine.

368
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,240
I'm fine.

369
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,240
I'm fine.

370
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,240
I'm fine.

371
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,240
I'm fine.

372
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,240
I'm fine.

373
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,240
Wait.

374
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,240
Brother.

375
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,240
You're back.

376
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,240
Who are you?

377
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,240
Do you know what goes on down at Eastern Courtyard?

378
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,240
We met her last time.

379
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,240
It's been really terrible.

380
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,240
I'm sorry.

381
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,240
You were going to get every star for me.

382
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,240
But now you are going on a date with Fu Zi.

383
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,240
Does it make you tired?

384
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,640
Who did you learn this from?

385
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,000
Don't listen to your mom.

386
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,360
Go. Go play.

387
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,920
Thank you, dad.

388
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,200
Why are you still holding the book?

389
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,200
Is it sweet?

390
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:33,720
Yes.

391
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,800
Will you fight with me in the future?

392
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,680
Definitely not.

393
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:43,760
Right.

394
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,520
Where's my nephew?

395
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,080
Why can't I see him today?

396
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,320
Who knows?

397
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,520
I guess he's out having fun somewhere.

398
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,960
Where are my dad and brother?

399
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,720
They should be training swords in the back of the mountain now.

400
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:06,920
Here.

401
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,840
It's so sweet

402
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:19,340
I hope it would never wake up

403
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,700
That's weird

404
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:34,200
Why should I say it's a dream?

405
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,380
No

406
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,120
My father is gone

407
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,120
I'm sorry.

408
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,320
A'Cui.

409
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,880
Isn't this a dream?

410
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,840
This is our future.

411
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,040
Yes.

412
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,800
This is our future.

413
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,320
The future I want even in my dreams.

414
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,040
Even if the whole world betrays you,

415
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,880
Yang Yitan won't.

416
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,600
Wang Juancui.

417
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,280
Wake up.

418
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,240
This is all an illusion.

419
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,340
No one wants your rear sight.

420
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,240
Yes.

421
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,920
When did you get controlled by the Black Tiger?

422
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:56,600
When I killed Yang Huanzhou and saved you.

423
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:19,720
Because of the great hatred, the Black Tiger power entered my eyes.

424
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,480
So...

425
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:26,160
you became like this because of me?

426
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,160
Yes.

427
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:31,000
What justice and power?

428
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,320
They are all fake.

429
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,720
Only the fate of the strong determines the fate of the weak.

430
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:41,040
That is the true place of this world.

431
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,560
Why do we sacrifice?

432
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,280
To defy the destiny?

433
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,880
Let me go!

434
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,200
Why don't we...

435
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,960
just use this world

436
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,440
to do whatever we want?

437
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,360
Do everything we want.

438
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:05,720
Get...

439
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:08,520
the person we want.

440
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,960
Who are you?

441
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,080
Have you forgotten?

442
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,640
Why did he open his eyes to the sky?

443
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,640
Because you were in danger?

444
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,840
Why did he kill his grandfather?

445
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,240
It's also because of you.

446
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,440
Since the beginning,

447
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,440
it's all because he chose you.

448
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,480
Wang Quanzui,

449
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:45,040
you are a hero and innocent.

450
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,840
But think about it.

451
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:50,640
Who is protecting you?

452
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,480
Do you regret it?

453
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,040
Do you blame yourself?

454
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,520
In this world,

455
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,600
there are a few people who love you like him.

456
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,880
He can't go back.

457
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,680
Why don't you be with him?

458
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,520
You couldn't live for the viewers,

459
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:16,320
but you grew up 15 years with him.

460
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,160
��

461
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,440
Yueyue!

462
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,440
Brother Yidan, I'm going to save Brother Liu.

463
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,440
Grandpa.

464
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,440
Brother Liu!

465
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,440
Wait for the chance.

466
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:08,440
Your daughter will never be able to wait for you to become a hero and return.

467
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,440
Brother Liu!

468
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,440
Brother Liu! No!

469
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,440
Brother Liu!

470
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,440
I've been looking for you.

471
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,440
I've been looking for you.

472
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,440
I've been looking for you.

473
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:08,440
I've been looking for you.

474
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,440
I've been looking for you.

475
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,440
I've been looking for you.

476
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,440
I've been looking for you.

477
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,440
I've been looking for you.

478
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,440
I've been looking for you.

479
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,440
I've been looking for you.

480
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,440
I've been looking for you.

481
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,440
I've been looking for you.

482
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,440
I've been looking for you.

483
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,440
I've been looking for you.

484
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:30,440
I've been looking for you.

485
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:32,440
I've been looking for you.

486
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,440
I've been looking for you.

487
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,440
I've been looking for you.

488
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,440
I've been looking for you.

489
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,440
I've been looking for you.

490
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,440
I've been looking for you.

491
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:44,440
I've been looking for you.

492
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:46,440
I've been looking for you.

493
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,440
I've been looking for you.

494
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:50,440
I've been looking for you.

495
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,440
I've been looking for you.

496
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,440
I've been looking for you.

497
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,440
I've been looking for you.

498
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:57,880
I've been looking for you.

499
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:59,900
I've been looking for you.

500
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,440
I've been looking for you.

501
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,660
I've been looking for you.

502
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,140
I've been looking for you.

503
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,720
I've been looking for you.

504
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:09,480
I've been looking for you.

505
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,440
I've been looking for you.

506
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:13,800
You've been looking for me.

507
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,420
I've been looking for you.

508
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,440
I've been looking for you.

509
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:19,840
I've been looking for you.

510
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,240
I've been looking for you.

511
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,460
I've been looking for you.

512
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:24,460
I've been looking for you.

513
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:25,380
You haven't looked for me.

514
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:28,220
I want to exchange our life for a happy ending

515
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:30,820
Even if we can't meet for a long time

516
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:33,420
I can't keep our past

517
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:35,740
It's like a dream

518
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:41,100
If we can meet again in the next life
