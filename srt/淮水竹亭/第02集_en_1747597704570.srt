1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The truth is...

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The truth is...

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The truth is...

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The truth is...

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The truth is...

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The truth is...

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The truth is...

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The truth is...

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The truth is...

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The truth is...

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The truth is...

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The truth is...

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The truth is...

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The truth is...

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The truth is...

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The truth is...

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The truth is...

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The truth is...

19
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The truth is...

20
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The truth is...

21
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The truth is...

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
The truth is...

23
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The truth is...

24
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
The truth is...

25
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The truth is...

26
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
The truth is...

27
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The truth is...

28
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The truth is...

29
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
The truth is...

30
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
The truth is...

31
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
The truth is...

32
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I will be back soon.

33
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I heard what you said in Star Tower.

34
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You want to attack Nan Chuai with Iqin Alliance, don't you?

35
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Come on.

36
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I won't take my nephew's demon elixir away.

37
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Are you trying to save Nan Chuai from the danger of being killed?

38
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
What's wrong with that?

39
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,880
The people of the Nangong family

40
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,600
can't escape from this.

41
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,600
The night will come when the candle of love is extinguished.

42
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,800
You should know the meaning of this eight-character idiom.

43
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,600
It means that there are two worlds in the world.

44
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,600
The horse and the cliff should stop fighting.

45
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,400
I've been in seclusion for a year.

46
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,400
You've been in this mess for a year.

47
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,200
Get out of here.

48
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,400
Your promise to me

49
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,000
is still valid.

50
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,400
I'll add one more.

51
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,600
I'll save Nanchui with all my strength

52
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
and make Nangongye pay for it.

53
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,600
Good.

54
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,800
Good.

55
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,600
My silly child,

56
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,600
I'll protect you.

57
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,200
Don't be afraid of anything.

58
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,200
I'm protecting

59
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,560
Junyao, who can only live on

60
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,600
by pitying his wife

61
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
and dulling his virginity.

62
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,800
Let me go.

63
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,200
Hello, Ms. Sh invested in our group call out of prison.

64
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,400
This morning, our club called out for you,

65
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:04,960
and you were.

66
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,120
That classmate of yours,

67
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,640
has finally shown up.

68
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,040
So, there must have been some issue for you.

69
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,900
Not at all.

70
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,080
I'm really sorry

71
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,840
for being a nuisance and not caring about you at all.

72
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,480
Hey,

73
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,140
did you call me for myself?

74
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,360
Huh?

75
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,240
Wait,

76
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,940
Hey,

77
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,800
Hey,

78
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,680
Don't run away

79
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:41,020
I wonder if something bad will come

80
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:50,380
Where any scary things were

81
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,180
And there were no schools

82
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,180
I passionately worked

83
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:58,180
But I'll avenge my wife

84
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,180
and build a star-picking tower.

85
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,180
I'm not wrong.

86
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,180
I won't.

87
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,180
Star-picking Tower

88
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,180
My Lady.

89
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,180
My Lady.

90
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,180
My dear.

91
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,620
I want you to live well

92
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,220
in your heart.

93
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,860
My dear.

94
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,180
My dear.

95
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:58,460
I want you to live well

96
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:02,100
in your heart.

97
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,540
My dear.

98
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:09,300
My dear.

99
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:16,260
I want you to live well

100
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:20,060
in your heart.

101
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,420
He Changbu is a person

102
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,420
It's a kind of restart.

103
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,720
His last request to you

104
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,840
is to live well.

105
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:47,880
Yaojun,

106
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,220
I'd like to spend a thousand years with you.

107
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,420
Yes.

108
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,800
Sister!

109
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,420
Sister!

110
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,720
Have you solved the Hundred-Mas Demon Army?

111
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,720
How did you solve it?

112
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,140
Did you encounter any danger?

113
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,720
It's not just the Hundred-Mas Demon Army.

114
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,720
We also encountered the King of Nanchui,

115
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,920
the Great Demon King,

116
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,420
who is the most powerful of the Heavens.

117
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,920
He has a power of three thousand years.

118
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,220
He's even known as the King of Nanchui.

119
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,220
Didn't he also get beaten by us

120
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,420
and fall into the river?

121
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,220
You're exaggerating.

122
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,720
At most, you can be regarded as a judge.

123
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,420
Did you get hurt?

124
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,220
Is it the hero who saves the beauty,

125
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,220
or the beauty who saves the hero?

126
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,420
Miss, you've worked hard.

127
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,420
Would you like to drink some water?

128
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,420
I'll get it for you.

129
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,720
Give it to him.

130
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,220
You're poisoned.

131
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,220
Follow me.

132
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,220
You're so stubborn.

133
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:17,220
You've absorbed too much poison from the poison of the poison.

134
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:21,220
The pills in the poison will be cured in a moment.

135
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,020
The pills in the poison will be cured in a moment.

136
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,020
Your sword skills.

137
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,020
Actually, you can poison with fire.

138
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,020
You don't need my protection at all.

139
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:42,020
I'm sorry that you can't be away from me.

140
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,020
All right.

141
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,020
I'll leave it to you.

142
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,020
I should go now.

143
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,820
Thank you.

144
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:52,820
Take care.

145
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,820
Little girl, let's go.

146
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:23,020
See you at the flower-water-beauty pavilion on the seventh day of the seventh month.

147
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,020
See you.

148
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,020
Your Majesty,

149
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,020
did you really let them go like this?

150
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,020
They were in the south of the river.

151
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:56,020
The sword came out of the river and the fire came from the east.

152
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:02,020
The weather is really changing.

153
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,020
There is a fire.

154
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,020
Where is the sword?

155
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,020
Although it's a different sword,

156
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:12,020
it's used to hide its identity.

157
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,020
But I'm sure that

158
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,020
it's not wrong.

159
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,020
The old man of the south palace

160
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:20,020
committed all kinds of crimes.

161
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,020
It's time to take revenge.

162
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,020
Hurry up!

163
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,020
Let's go!

164
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,020
Hurry up!

165
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,020
Let's go!

166
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,020
Hurry up!

167
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,020
Let's go!

168
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,020
Hurry up!

169
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,020
Hurry up!

170
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,020
Let's go!

171
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,020
Sister!

172
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,020
Let's go!

173
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,020
Little girl, run!

174
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,020
Hurry up!

175
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,020
Sister!

176
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,020
Let's go!

177
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,020
Let's go!

178
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,020
Little girl!

179
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,020
Sister!

180
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,020
Sister!

181
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:13,020
Let go of my sister!

182
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,020
Let go of my sister!

183
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,020
Little girl!

184
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,020
Sister!

185
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,020
Why are you chasing me?

186
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,020
Don't touch my little girl!

187
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,020
I think you must be very sad now.

188
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,020
My family caught you

189
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:43,020
to take your elixir and sword.

190
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:46,020
But not all the demons with sword

191
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,020
have this qualification.

192
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,020
We have to choose the strongest,

193
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,020
the most stubborn,

194
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,020
and the most grieved.

195
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,020
You can't die!

196
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,020
Grief is not strong enough.

197
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,020
Don't touch my little girl!

198
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,020
Let's go!

199
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,020
Let go of my sister!

200
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,020
Little girl!

201
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,020
Little girl!

202
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,020
I'm sorry!

203
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,020
I'm sorry!

204
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,020
I won't let you go!

205
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,020
I won't let you go!

206
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,020
I won't let you go!

207
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,020
I won't let you go!

208
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,020
I won't let you go!

209
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,020
That's enough.

210
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,020
You did it.

211
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,020
Who is it?

212
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,020
Little girl!

213
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,020
Little girl!

214
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,020
Your master is so cruel.

215
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:49,020
Why don't you do the same for him?

216
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,020
What a good girl!

217
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,020
Who?

218
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,020
How dare you ruin my family's good deeds!

219
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:09,020
I'm so scared of your family's reputation.

220
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,020
I thought it was someone else.

221
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,020
It's just a sword

222
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,020
from your two mask groups.

223
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,020
What are you waiting for?

224
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,020
Kill them!

225
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,020
Kill them!

226
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,020
Three steps to the left, right sword.

227
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,020
Left sword, step back.

228
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,020
Right and left, arms.

229
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,020
Brother, are you really a mouth-to-mouth man?

230
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,020
I'm a man of my word.

231
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,020
You guys are useless!

232
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,020
Kill them!

233
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,020
You're talking too much, brother.

234
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,020
I was holding back.

235
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:28,020
I didn't expect you to be so cunning.

236
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,020
Isn't it so unexpected?

237
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,020
Hongye.

238
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,020
Hongye.

239
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,020
My son Hongye.

240
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:12,020
This tree is made of hate.

241
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:17,020
The hatred of love will be gone forever.

242
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,020
I will never forgive you.

243
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:23,020
The hatred of love will be gone forever.

244
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:28,020
The peace of the world will never come back.

245
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,020
Hongye.

246
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,020
Remember my words.

247
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:38,020
Stop the fight between the demons.

248
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,020
Stop the coming of the night.

249
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,020
I had this dream again.

250
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,020
It's been three years.

251
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,020
I've been repeating this dream.

252
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,020
I will never forgive you.

253
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,020
I will never forgive you.

254
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:58,020
I will never forgive you.

255
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:01,020
I will never forgive you.

256
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,020
I will never forgive you.

257
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,020
I will never forgive you.

258
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:10,020
I will never forgive you.

259
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:13,020
I will never forgive you.

260
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,020
I will never forgive you.

261
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,020
I will never forgive you.

262
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,020
I will never forgive you.

263
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,020
It takes one month.

264
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,020
It can't be done in one day.

265
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,020
Does it work?

266
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:39,020
You can make a fortune.

267
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,020
It takes one month to make a fortune.

268
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,020
What do you think?

269
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,020
Do you think it will work?

270
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,020
It's useless.

271
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,020
You're ugly.

272
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,020
I'm coming late.

273
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,260
I'm late. I'll drink with you.

274
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,420
This is the barbecue from Yunhe Restaurant.

275
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,900
This is the plain rice from Sujinji.

276
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,260
And this is the dessert from Hwa Ying.

277
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:05,060
Brother, come out.

278
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,860
There's your favorite cake.

279
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:13,020
This is the map of the Southern Palace's building.

280
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,260
After you enter the building,

281
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,020
the building will open a mysterious formation.

282
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,060
No one will be watching you.

283
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,140
You have to go out yourself to break through this barrier.

284
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,380
I don't believe it.

285
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:37,460
This one.

286
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,060
How is it?

287
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,060
You lost, right?

288
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,780
I won't fight.

289
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,380
I'll just be honest.

290
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,860
I'll break through the barrier.

291
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,860
The Black Sword Zhang family

292
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,860
will pass you the jade seal.

293
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,860
How is it? You lost, right?

294
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,260
You lost, right?

295
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,660
Why is the Zhang family here to pay respect to my father?

296
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:21,460
The Zhang family is not here to propose.

297
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,060
Then I'll just...

298
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,660
The leader of the mask group will be your guest.

299
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,060
Lang,

300
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,860
there's no leader of the mask group.

301
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,260
What nonsense is this?

302
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,380
There's no sign of him.

303
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,260
Besides,

304
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:41,260
the Black Sword is known as the second sword of the First Qi Alliance.

305
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:44,180
Why would the leader of the mask group

306
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,260
be my guest?

307
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:50,060
Unless you have Wang Quan's invitation card.

308
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,860
You don't understand.

309
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,660
I never ask about the world.

310
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,860
I'm more polite to outsiders.

311
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,060
How could I like these family members?

312
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,260
I don't think so.

313
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,860
But the leader of the mask group

314
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,860
is more interesting to me.

315
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,260
Tell me.

316
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:15,460
Is your sister interested in him or your sister?

317
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,460
You want to know?

318
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,660
Then you admit defeat.

319
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,260
I'll tell you if you admit defeat.

320
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,260
My sister and I are going up the mountain

321
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,060
to meet the chosen one.

322
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,260
Come on.

323
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,060
Come on.

324
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,660
Tell me after you finish.

325
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,460
Hold this.

326
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,260
What are you doing?

327
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,460
Well...

328
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,660
You're still a matchmaker.

329
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,460
You broke the door.

330
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:47,460
I'm doing this for my sister's sake.

331
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:51,060
Then you can use her invitation card to play cards.

332
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,260
We're doing this for...

333
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:59,860
For a bet.

334
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,060
Yangyang is right.

335
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,460
For a bet.

336
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:06,060
Look at these messy and impure things.

337
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,060
Go away.

338
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,060
Go away.

339
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,660
You're all a matchmaker.

340
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,060
So, my sister.

341
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,460
Did you play the game today?

342
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,860
Dad.

343
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,660
Did you take the medicine today?

344
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,460
I'm hungry.

345
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,460
It's time to eat.

346
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,460
Let me clean up.

347
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,460
Let me do it.

348
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,260
I'll do the rough work.

349
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,060
It's not funny.

350
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,460
It's not that important.

351
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:33,060
You can make up for it tomorrow.

352
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,460
But you can't forget the medicine.

353
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,660
I'll bring it to you.

354
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,860
You're a man of your word.

355
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:41,660
Uncle Chu Ri, don't make it hard for your father.

356
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,660
Yang.

357
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,460
Young Master.

358
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:01,460
The family of the Shi family is waiting for you.

359
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:04,060
They're waiting for you.

360
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,260
Any news about my father?

361
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,460
No.

362
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:10,460
The Nangong family is suspicious.

363
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:14,260
They think the family is not like us.

364
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:21,260
So they're getting more and more impudent.

365
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,660
The Nangong family is a big family.

366
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,660
Be careful.

367
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,460
He has the intention of taking power.

368
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,260
Young Master Wang Quan.

369
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,660
Young Master Wang Quan.

370
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,660
You're all on your own.

371
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,460
I won't say anything.

372
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:48,060
When will you order the family to attack Nanchui?

373
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,660
I'll do it.

374
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,260
I'll do it.

375
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,660
I'll do it.

376
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,060
I'll do it.

377
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,260
I'll do it.

378
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,860
Attack Nanchui.

379
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,260
The chief's token is here.

380
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:06,060
Please order the Nangong family.

381
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,060
I'm the chief of the Ji clan.

382
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,460
I'm Wang Quan.

383
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:20,260
I'm the chief of the Young Master.

384
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:23,860
I have the gift of wearing the robe.

385
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,460
The Nangong family's proposal

386
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:32,060
is to attack Nanchui with the power of Yi Qi Alliance.

387
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,260
Report, Young Master.

388
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:42,260
The Nanchui King sent a letter of surrender.

389
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:46,260
The demon star is always cunning and dangerous.

390
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,460
I'm willing to surrender now.

391
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,060
It's too late.

392
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:54,460
The letter of surrender and this thing

393
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,260
would be removed.

394
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,460
This is the demon pawns of Demon Lord Baimu.

395
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,460
Demon Lord Baimu has given us his demon pawns.

396
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:30,460
Master, do we really have to listen to Wang Quan?

397
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:34,460
Didn't you hear what he said?

398
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:40,460
The poison has been given to the demon elixir of the Hundred-Eye Demon Army.

399
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:44,460
If the Yi Qi Sect still refuses to give up,

400
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,460
the demon clan will be in chaos.

401
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:49,460
The Yi Qi Sect will be in trouble.

402
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,460
The Yi Qi Sect will be in trouble.

403
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:56,460
Wang Quan and Hongye are causing us trouble.

404
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:04,460
The demon elixir of the Hundred-Eye Demon Army

405
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:07,460
is a bit too coincidental, isn't it?

406
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:14,460
Yes, it is a bit too coincidental.

407
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:18,460
Our Young Master Wang Quan

408
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,460
is like the sky.

409
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:23,460
He seems to be in peace,

410
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:26,460
but he is hiding in the clouds.

411
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:30,460
The Yi Qi Sect's clouds are now being attacked by the South Palace.

412
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:33,460
If Hongye doesn't listen to me,

413
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,460
I'll just kill him.

414
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,460
Did anyone tell you

415
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:50,460
that the young lady from the Eastern Region is very pretty when she orders tea?

416
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,460
Did anyone tell you

417
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:55,460
that the young lady from the Yang family who doesn't drink

418
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:58,460
is very strange?

419
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:02,460
They all said that her health is not good recently.

420
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:07,460
What? Are you angry that I'm not drinking with you?

421
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:11,460
Yang Yan, you are really a good person.

422
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:14,460
Are you angry that I'm not drinking with you?

423
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:18,460
Yang Yan, you are not right.

424
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:28,460
Every time I see your family being happy,

425
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,460
I feel so happy.

426
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,460
And your food is very delicious.

427
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,460
It has a smoky scent.

428
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:40,460
You came to see me today

429
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,460
because you wanted to

430
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:47,460
have a talk with me, right?

431
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:52,460
I just wanted to see you.

432
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:56,460
Did anything happen to Mu Xiaowu?

433
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:59,460
Or did your father dislike her being at peace

434
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:02,460
and not allow you to get to know her?

435
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:06,460
If my father despises her, I'll leave with her.

436
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,460
But...

437
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,460
But...

438
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,460
What happened to her?

439
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,460
What happened to her?

440
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,460
She was watching the situation in the mine.

441
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:27,460
She was soft-hearted and let go of a little demon.

442
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:30,460
She was exposed to the Yiqi Alliance.

443
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,460
Mu...

444
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:36,460
She was taken away by the Yiqi Alliance.

445
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:41,460
The Yiqi Alliance is the leader of the Nangong family.

446
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:46,460
They used it to force the other clans to fight against the Yiqi Alliance.

447
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,460
Our family is very poor.

448
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:51,460
Even if my father came to help, he couldn't help her.

449
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:55,460
I'm worried about the Yiqi Alliance.

450
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:01,460
There will be a way.

451
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,460
There will be a way.

452
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,460
There will be a way.

453
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,460
I came to see you today.

454
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:19,460
I didn't want to tell you this.

455
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:22,460
I said it would only make you sad.

456
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:28,460
But I don't know if I'll...

457
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,460
If you don't want me to give you the pulse,

458
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,460
tell me.

459
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:40,460
What's the real reason you can't drink?

460
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:47,460
I have the blood of my child again.

461
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,460
The other clansmen are dissatisfied with Wang Quan.

462
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,460
They want me to take the throne.

463
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:10,460
Wang Quan has been missing for a long time.

464
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:13,460
Wang Quan Hongye, this coward,

465
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:16,460
is also a part of the Yiqi Alliance.

466
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,460
He's a coward?

467
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:21,460
Since he took the position of Yiqi Alliance,

468
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:24,460
Wang Quan has never stepped out of the ring.

469
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:27,460
What is a coward?

470
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:29,460
He's a coward.

471
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:32,460
What is a coward?

472
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:35,460
The Nangong family is in a good position.

473
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:38,460
You should take the initiative.

474
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:43,460
He's not a coward.

475
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:49,460
He might want to take the initiative.

476
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:52,460
I'll take care of it.

477
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:01,460
This sword will be made in 10 days.

478
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:04,460
I'll hold a night party.

479
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:09,460
I'll invite Wang Quan Hongye and other clansmen to come.

480
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:14,460
You mean you want to catch the enemy?

481
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:19,460
The fire in the furnace is not strong enough.

482
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:23,460
Remember, despair can make the furnace more powerful.

483
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,460
No matter who you are,

484
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:28,460
there's something stupid that you can't let go.

485
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,460
It's the feeling.

486
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:33,460
That's their weakness.

487
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:37,460
I understand. I'll do it right now.

488
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:41,460
As for Wang Quan Hongye,

489
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:45,460
I'll go to the mountain villa.

490
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:49,460
Only the fire can fight against Wang Quan.

491
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:52,460
You're not afraid of the fire,

492
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:55,460
so you'll come to me?

493
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:59,460
The fire has been in the shadow for years.

494
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:03,460
The light is bright, but it's not real.

495
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:08,460
When the fire comes out, it will be in the dark.

496
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:16,460
Everyone can see that the fire is in the south.

497
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,460
Sister!

498
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,460
Where's Yang?

499
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,460
She's gone.

500
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:41,460
Sister, why do you look unhappy?

501
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:50,460
You know Yang is my only friend.

502
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,460
Of course I know.

503
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:56,460
You told me that you were classmates.

504
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:00,460
She's a beautiful person like a warm moon.

505
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:04,460
I've always thought that

506
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:07,460
the fire is in the shadow.

507
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:10,460
We're a happy family.

508
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:14,460
It's right to give up on fame and fortune.

509
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:19,460
But now, we're far apart.

510
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:25,460
I can't even help my best friend.

511
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,460
So, Qinglan,

512
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:34,460
is there really an alien in this world?

513
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,460
Miss, a guest came to the mountain villa.

514
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,460
He said he's the head of the Nangong family.

515
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,460
He wants to see you.

516
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:46,460
Nangongye?

517
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:49,460
Ji-cha-si?

518
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,460
Ji-cha-si.

519
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,460
Nangongye.

520
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:08,460
What brings you here today?

521
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,460
I'm sorry to bother you.

522
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:13,460
Miss Dongfang, you're a good person.

523
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:16,460
I have something to discuss with you.

524
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,460
Yi Ji-meng has been killed.

525
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,460
He's guilty of murder.

526
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:23,460
I've decided to take his place.

527
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:26,460
I'll ask Miss Dongfang to help me

528
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:29,460
to kill Wang Quan and Hongye.

529
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,460
Mr. Nangong,

530
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:35,460
what can I do for you?

531
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:40,460
As long as you can take Wang Quan down,

532
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:44,460
I'll do whatever you need.

533
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,460
Young Master,

534
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:52,460
he's not only attacking Nangongye,

535
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,460
but also holding a sword opening ceremony.

536
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,460
He'll definitely make a request

537
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:59,460
to promote the sword-catching of the demon elixir.

538
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,460
If you don't do it,

539
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:04,460
you'll be an enemy of Nangong.

540
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:06,460
I'm just an enemy.

541
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:09,460
I'm just a pawn.

542
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:12,460
Are you going?

543
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:14,460
There's a red gate banquet in ten days.

544
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,460
Take Yang Yitan with Zha Zui

545
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,460
and come with me.

546
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:24,460
The End

547
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,460
The End

548
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:54,460
The End

549
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,460
The End

550
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,460
The End
