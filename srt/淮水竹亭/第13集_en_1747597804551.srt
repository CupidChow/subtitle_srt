00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The dream of the heavenly eye is real

9
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The dream of the heavenly eye is real

10
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What happened to him?

11
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Why did he dig his own heavenly eye?

12
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
The news of the gathering of the human and demon in Biluocheng is the most painful

13
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
The news of the gathering of the human and demon in Biluocheng is the most painful

14
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I must find him

15
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The news of the gathering of the human and demon in Biluocheng is the most painful

16
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
The news of the gathering of the human and demon in Biluocheng is the most painful

17
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The news of the gathering of the human and demon in Biluocheng is the most painful

18
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The news of the gathering of the human and demon in Biluocheng is the most painful

19
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The news of the gathering of the human and demon in Biluocheng is the most painful

20
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The red leaf of the netherworld

21
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The red leaf of the netherworld

22
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You said that Lord Jiuhuo erased my memory and lied to me

23
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You said that Lord Jiuhuo erased my memory and lied to me

24
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
But Lord Jiuhuo said that you were the one who gave me the demon order

25
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
The demon order

26
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's true that the power of Jialan can be removed by the magic

27
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's pretty good

28
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I said that you would come to save me

29
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Save me

30
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I can help you deal with Jiuhuo

31
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I said that I would deal with Lord Jiuhuo

32
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Is he really good to you?

33
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Or he treats you as the enemy of Jialan?

34
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Why is your mandrake exactly the same as Jialan's?

35
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You are a prisoner

36
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
How dare you to make a mess between me and Lord Jiuhuo

37
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I know that what he wants is not only a substitute

38
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
He wants a real Jialan

39
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I am a demon, not a substitute for anyone

40
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Then...

41
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Then you just prove it to me

42
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
y

43
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Why does the path get匃 З

44
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,440
I'm so hungry.

45
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,760
I have hope.

46
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,360
I'm the devil, not a substitute for anyone.

47
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,640
Then prove it to me.

48
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,160
Guards.

49
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,280
Zuo Hu Fa.

50
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,120
Is Lord Jiuhuo in his room?

51
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,280
Report to Zuo Hu Fa. He's out of the city.

52
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,880
I see. You may leave.

53
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,280
Yes.

54
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,920
Tianni, why are your eyes so round?

55
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:44,400
They are death уith yourרי gifted as

56
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,400
I will go to the underground palace of the Demon Kingdom alone.

57
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,400
Demon Kingdom?

58
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,400
The black fox is gone.

59
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,400
The circle is the key.

60
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,400
Everything I do now is to save Jialan.

61
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,400
Jialan is still alive?

62
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,400
Of course.

63
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,400
But she is blocked outside the circle.

64
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,400
She can't get in.

65
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,400
The black fox outside the circle is Jialan.

66
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,400
The black fox is the stone of hatred.

67
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,400
The demon is powerful.

68
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,400
She can control people's hearts and no bodies.

69
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,400
No bodies?

70
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:00,400
She is alive but no body outside the circle.

71
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,400
It's you.

72
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,400
Very good.

73
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,400
I am very satisfied.

74
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,400
No wonder you said it very well.

75
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:18,400
I am the new body that Lord Jiuhuo prepared for you.

76
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,400
Lord Jiuhuo's wine is so good.

77
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,400
It's so small.

78
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,400
Why don't you drink with Huai Zhu?

79
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,400
Lord Jiuhuo,

80
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,400
I am sorry.

81
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,400
I am sorry.

82
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,400
You look worried.

83
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:14,400
A very important monster has escaped.

84
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,400
But I have asked Ye Yuan to find it.

85
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:24,400
After the repair, you can save Jialan.

86
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,400
Will I be disliked?

87
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:38,400
It seems that you will.

88
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:44,400
As compensation, I will take this bottle of wine.

89
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,400
I am leaving.

90
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,400
Slow down.

91
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,400
You look so tired.

92
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,400
You must have come from a far place.

93
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,400
Where are you going?

94
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,400
I am going to Jincheng Inn.

95
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,400
This is Baiyu Village.

96
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,400
It's not far from here.

97
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,400
It's Jincheng Inn.

98
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,400
It seems that the water monster didn't lie to me.

99
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,400
What did you say?

100
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,400
You met the water monster?

101
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,400
Where is it?

102
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,400
Where is it?

103
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,400
I think it's going east.

104
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,400
It should be the other way around.

105
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,400
Village head, I can't remember.

106
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,400
Does it hurt?

107
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,400
I am in a bad mood.

108
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,400
I drank too much.

109
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,400
How did it go?

110
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,400
I am in a bad mood now.

111
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,400
Don't push me.

112
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,400
You are laughing at me.

113
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,400
I really came to you.

114
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,400
Is everything as you expected?

115
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,400
I am laughing.

116
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,400
I can't die for now.

117
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,400
The night is coming.

118
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,400
The night is referring to...

119
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,400
Jialan.

120
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,400
The night is Jialan.

121
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,400
I want to wipe everything off you.

122
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,400
I want you to be a black tiger.

123
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,400
Can you still laugh?

124
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,400
I can help you.

125
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,400
I can help you.

126
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,400
I can.

127
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,400
The spiritual energy has blocked your heart.

128
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,400
If you don't listen,

129
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,400
I can make you suffer.

130
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,400
You still don't believe me.

131
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:37,400
The opponent is the black tiger and the wine monster.

132
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,400
Can the old god change?

133
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,400
Village head, don't be sad.

134
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,400
Just be at ease.

135
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,400
Yes, village head.

136
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,400
Don't be sad, father.

137
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,400
We will find him again.

138
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,400
We will avenge my brother.

139
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,400
Don't mind.

140
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,400
My brother died in the hands of the stone monster.

141
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:10,400
My father just wants to avenge my brother.

142
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,400
But he is not evil.

143
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,400
He even helped me point out the way.

144
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,400
The monsters are all evil.

145
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,400
They are deceiving people.

146
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,400
Village head. Village head. Village head.

147
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,400
Brother Song, we found the water monster.

148
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:33,400
Young master, we have to kill him.

149
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:37,400
Since you are here, let's go together.

150
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,400
It should be around here.

151
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,400
Let me see.

152
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,400
There is something in the forest.

153
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,400
Okay.

154
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,400
Brother Song, this is...

155
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,400
A cat demon.

156
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,400
It's a bait.

157
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,400
Hurry up. Hide.

158
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,400
It's here.

159
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,400
You are too much.

160
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,400
What? They are demons.

161
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,400
If you don't do this, how can you lure the water monster?

162
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,400
When we catch the water monster, we will go to the palace together.

163
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,400
Then we will get the reward.

164
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,400
It's really him.

165
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,400
I will go to the palace with you.

166
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,400
Okay.

167
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,400
He is saving the monster.

168
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,400
What are you doing?

169
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,400
Be careful.

170
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,400
The water monster.

171
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,400
What are you waiting for? Do it.

172
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,400
Brother Mu, I want the antidote.

173
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,400
Hurry up.

174
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,400
Miss, if I'm not mistaken,

175
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,400
you only used the anesthetic poison.

176
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,400
It won't kill you.

177
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,400
You dare to trick me.

178
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,400
What? He is a monster.

179
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,400
He is a monster. How can we do this?

180
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,400
Don't forget that you are here to catch the monster.

181
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,400
I am here to catch the monster.

182
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,400
But I can't kill the innocent.

183
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,400
What is the truth?

184
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,400
We must ask him.

185
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,400
Why did he save me?

186
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,400
Village head.

187
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,400
The monster is back.

188
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,400
I finally caught you.

189
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,400
I will kill you to avenge my son.

190
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,400
Kill him.

191
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,400
Don't worry.

192
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,400
Village head, let me ask him first.

193
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,400
What kind of people are you?

194
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,400
Miss, why did you kill the village head's son?

195
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,400
Are you asking the reason of a monster killing people?

196
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,400
The monster is the monster.

197
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,400
My son's death is the best evidence.

198
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,400
What else can I ask?

199
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,400
Yes.

200
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,400
I will kill you to avenge my son.

201
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,400
I will kill you.

202
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,400
Father, father.

203
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,400
Don't make trouble.

204
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,400
If he goes out with the monster,

205
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,400
we will be in trouble.

206
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,400
Brother Mu, I know you are kind.

207
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,400
So as you said,

208
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,400
when the monster is back,

209
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,400
you must kill him.

210
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,400
I know.

211
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,400
But I can't kill him.

212
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,400
Village head,

213
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,400
Then, as you said,

214
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,400
when the demon confesses his crime,

215
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,400
we will punish him as well.

216
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,400
Thank you, Brother Sun.

217
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,400
Thank you, Village Chief.

218
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,400
What a face!

219
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,400
You believe everything.

220
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,400
When a girl is angry,

221
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,400
her eyes will turn red.

222
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,400
It's rare.

223
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,400
What are you doing?

224
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,400
I'm helping you untie the rope.

225
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,400
Because I don't think you're a bad demon.

226
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,400
You look so fake.

227
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,400
You're so annoying.

228
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,400
Blue Eye, you do it.

229
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,400
Blue Eye, you do it.

230
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,400
It's blue again.

231
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,400
Are you not angry?

232
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,400
I lied to you.

233
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,400
I pointed the wrong way for you.

234
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,400
I didn't expect you to come here.

235
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,400
I know you came here.

236
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,400
But this village is not a good place.

237
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,400
Please leave here.

238
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,400
Can you tell me

239
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,400
if you really killed the village chief's son?

240
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,400
I...

241
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,400
Brother Mu.

242
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,400
I...

243
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,400
Why is the rope untied?

244
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,400
Brother Sun, I'm here.

245
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,400
I can't run away.

246
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,400
Thank you, Brother Mu.

247
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,400
Drink the porridge first.

248
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,400
Thank you, Brother Sun.

249
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,400
Have some porridge.

250
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,400
We'll talk about it when you're full.

251
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,400
For me?

252
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,400
For me?

253
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,400
Yes. Aren't you hungry?

254
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,400
I didn't know someone poisoned me.

255
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:08,740
What a little

256
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,400
What's wrong?

257
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,400
I suddenly feel weak.

258
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,400
But is it...

259
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,400
Is it food poisoning?

260
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,400
Young Master, you're poisoned.

261
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,400
Poisoned.

262
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,400
I've never been here before.

263
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,400
Who would harm me?

264
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,400
Forget it. I'll take you away.

265
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,400
You're so annoying.

266
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,400
You're so annoying.

267
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,400
You're so annoying.

268
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,400
You're so annoying.

269
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,400
You're so annoying.

270
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,400
Brother Mu, where are you going in the middle of the night?

271
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:58,400
This little girl is so beautiful.

272
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:03,400
Brother Mu, why don't you go and see the slave?

273
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,400
What do you want to do?

274
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,400
Lanyan, you can't do this.

275
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,400
Let me do it.

276
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,400
What a good girl.

277
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,400
I'm afraid you can't.

278
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,400
Then I'll give you a chance.

279
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,400
I was kind enough to heal you before.

280
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,400
You attacked me.

281
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,400
Now you dare to say I'm a commoner.

282
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,400
Miss.

283
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,400
Let's leave here first.

284
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,400
Let's go.

285
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,400
Miss.

286
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,400
Little Face.

287
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,400
I let you dodge a sword in the woods last time.

288
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,400
This time, you two don't run away.

289
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,400
Why?

290
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,400
You're protecting the monster who killed my son.

291
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,400
Damn it.

292
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,400
Today, none of you can escape.

293
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,400
Yu Yaofeng.

294
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,400
What are you waiting for? Kill them.

295
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,400
Kandu.

296
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,400
Kandu.

297
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,400
How is it?

298
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,400
My room is not bad, right?

299
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:23,400
You didn't say that I thought it was Jialan's room.

300
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,400
You know what you did to me.

301
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,400
It's pretty miserable.

302
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,400
Come here.

303
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,400
Sit.

304
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,400
I'll do it myself.

305
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,400
You're not going to do it?

306
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,400
I'm not going to do it.

307
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,400
I'm going to do it myself.

308
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,400
I'm going to do it myself.

309
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,400
I'm going to do it myself.

310
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,400
If you keep being like this,

311
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,400
I can't believe you can help me.

312
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,400
I'm going to do it myself.

313
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,400
I'm going to do it myself.

314
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,400
I'm going to do it myself.

315
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,400
I'm going to do it myself.

316
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,400
I'm going to do it myself.

317
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,400
I'm going to do it myself.

318
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,400
I'm going to do it myself.

319
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,400
I'm going to do it myself.

320
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,400
I'm going to do it myself.

321
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,400
I'm going to do it myself.

322
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,400
I'm going to do it myself.

323
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,400
I'm going to do it myself.

324
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,400
I'm going to do it myself.

325
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,400
I'm going to do it myself.

326
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,400
I'll go.

327
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,400
I'll go.

328
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,400
I'll go.

329
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,400
I'll go.

330
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,400
I'll go.

331
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,400
I'll go.

332
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,400
I'll go.

333
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,400
I'll go.

334
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,400
I'll go.

335
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,400
I'll go.

336
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,400
I'll go.

337
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:33,400
You can give up your life for Dongfang Yuchong.

338
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:39,460
Your breathing is soon rotting.

339
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,220
Do not say too much anymore.

340
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,420
I won't say anymore.

341
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:59,000
Will you ever laugh forever?

342
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,500
Upon knees,

343
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,940
and after legs,

344
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:02,940
It's so disgusting.

345
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:13,940
What is this?

346
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:16,940
I prepared this for you.

347
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:18,940
It's a love-sickness incense.

348
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:21,940
For me?

349
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:23,940
Do you like it?

350
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,940
Your face is so red.

351
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,940
Is it because you're not feeling well?

352
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:36,940
You're shy?

353
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,940
Are you feeling better now?

354
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:24,940
I'm sorry.

355
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:26,940
This is not what you want.

356
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:28,940
Then what do I want?

357
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,940
What you want...

358
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:34,940
What you want is...

359
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:37,940
to know what the nine living things

360
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:39,940
will do for you.

361
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:41,940
What?

362
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:43,940
What?

363
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:45,940
What?

364
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:47,940
What?

365
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:49,940
What?

366
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:51,940
What?

367
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:52,940
What will the nine living things

368
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:54,940
do for you?

369
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,940
Who else can save your life?

370
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,940
Help you deal with the nine living things.

371
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:04,940
You mean...

372
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:06,940
that person is you?

373
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,940
The only person who can help you is me.

374
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,940
Why don't you continue?

375
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:15,940
Because...

376
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,940
Because you trust me.

377
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:27,940
If you can still hold on to the incense

378
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,940
and the love-sickness incense,

379
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,940
I'll be like you.

380
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:39,940
I'll be like you.

381
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,940
I believe you're a useful person.

382
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:48,940
But...

383
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,940
it's not easy.

384
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:56,940
After all, I made this incense myself.

385
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,940
You...

386
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:42,940
Your Highness.

387
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:09,940
Master!

388
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:12,580
Where are you going?

389
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:13,940
I'm going to Baiyu Village.

390
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:16,140
I haven't figured out the details.

391
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,740
Bai... Baiyu Village?

392
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,780
I know you're afraid of Baiyu Village.

393
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,820
Don't worry. I'm just going to have a look.

394
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,940
Thank you for curing me.

395
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,620
Take care.

396
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,460
Sample swordsmanship

397
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:52,220
Face masks are good.

398
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:12,340
That Ye Yuan has left the city.

399
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,740
Don't alert him.
