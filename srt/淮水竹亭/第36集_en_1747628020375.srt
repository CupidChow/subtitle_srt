00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Love by Hypnotic

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The Love by Hypnotic

3
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,480
Episode 2

4
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,920
You've been working hard

5
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,800
these days.

6
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,400
Huai Chu,

7
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:39,400
can't humans and demons live peacefully?

8
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,400
Did we make a mistake

9
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,800
in giving up everything?

10
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:59,000
I hope that the mask I love

11
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,600
will remember its appearance.

12
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,200
Huai Chu.

13
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,400
When you used to smile,

14
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,200
your mouth would always look here.

15
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,000
Your eyes would be bent.

16
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,600
Like a moon.

17
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,400
This place

18
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,000
is also familiar.

19
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,800
Huai Chu.

20
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,600
I'm sorry.

21
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,800
I'm sorry.

22
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,400
In the shadow,

23
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,000
I want to be myself.

24
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,800
Too hasty.

25
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,400
If there's a wish,

26
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,000
I'll ask for it.

27
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,800
May the gods and demons

28
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,800
keep it.

29
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,200
I hope this plan

30
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,200
can let us use love

31
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,200
to destroy everything.

32
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,700
Over the years,

33
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:10,600
this handpawn

34
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:16,800
is Xie Flu's personal toy.

35
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,200
This machine

36
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:28,800
is Xie Xieng Su's personal toy too.

37
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,800
I'm just a child.

38
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,800
Boys should be as kind as you.

39
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:44,200
Girls should be as smart as you.

40
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,200
Then what should I be like?

41
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,600
You'd better not be like me.

42
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,200
Why?

43
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I think he'll be like his father.

44
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,600
He'll be the master of the world, saving the world,

45
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,200
and becoming a hero.

46
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,400
You'll be a father in eight months.

47
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,800
Don't you remember the prints on yourzubajie's leg?

48
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,200
Yes, I do.

49
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:38,200
But you want to be a mother.

50
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:42,000
That's impossible.

51
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,200
I'll keep my word.

52
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,800
I won't lie to you.

53
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,400
But you must always do!

54
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,400
will become the strongest sword in the world.

55
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,400
Since then,

56
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,400
Hongye has been getting more and more energetic.

57
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,400
In his heart,

58
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,400
there is finally a hope.

59
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,400
A hope that can bear everything.

60
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,400
Master, you...

61
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,400
I have to prepare the books,

62
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,400
weapons, and swords for my child every year.

63
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,400
Madam,

64
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,400
this is not even three yuan.

65
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,400
Those books

66
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,400
are all in bad shape.

67
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,400
I can't read them.

68
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,400
I'll get someone to copy them.

69
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,400
Yes, I'll do it right now.

70
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,400
What do you want from me?

71
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,400
This is the kitchen

72
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,400
that I prepared for you.

73
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,400
Change the fish.

74
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,400
Huaiju smells disgusting.

75
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,400
Change it to

76
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,400
green bamboo shoots and blood lily red.

77
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,400
Speed up the seasoning.

78
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,400
Okay, I'll tell the kitchen to do it right now.

79
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,400
In addition,

80
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,400
Huaiju has been vomiting a lot recently.

81
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,400
He said his mouth is sore.

82
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,400
I remember my mouth is sore.

83
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,400
I remember when I was vomiting,

84
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,400
it was not comfortable.

85
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,400
Why don't you ask the kitchen

86
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,400
to make something sour and sweet

87
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,400
to open your stomach?

88
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,400
Okay, get ready.

89
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,400
Okay.

90
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,400
And,

91
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,400
so many snacks.

92
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,400
Uncle Fei said

93
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,400
you didn't have much appetite recently.

94
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,400
So I prepared these.

95
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,400
Maybe it will be better.

96
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,400
If you need anything,

97
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,400
tell me anytime

98
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,400
you want to eat or do.

99
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,400
There is one thing

100
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,400
I really want to do.

101
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,400
What is it?

102
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,400
I want our family

103
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,400
to go to the Huaishui Bamboo Tent.

104
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,400
Okay.

105
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,400
Next July,

106
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,400
we will go there with our child.

107
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,400
How can we go there?

108
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,400
As before,

109
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,400
I will go there with my sword,

110
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,400
you will go there with your enemy.

111
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,400
Hold the child?

112
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,400
Then I have to wear

113
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,400
clothes to change clothes.

114
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,400
Don't pee on you.

115
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,400
It's disgusting again.

116
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,400
I'll get you some water.

117
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,400
Okay.

118
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,400
Elders,

119
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,400
the world is in chaos

120
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,400
because of the

121
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,400
people's talent.

122
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,400
I have a way

123
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,400
to break the trap

124
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,400
for the present situation.

125
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,400
How?

126
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,400
A girl

127
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,400
can transfer her

128
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,400
spiritual power

129
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,400
to the child

130
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,400
and use the only secret

131
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,400
of Wang Quan

132
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,400
to help her open the

133
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,400
Heaven Sword Spirit.

134
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,400
Then she can

135
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,400
have the two families

136
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,400
and the child's talent.

137
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,400
This is

138
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,400
the plan of the weapon

139
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,400
and the soldiers.

140
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,400
You mean

141
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,400
you and the child of Hu Ye

142
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,400
will collect the spirit blood of the east

143
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,400
and use the essence of the second turn

144
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,400
to destroy the strongest Heaven Sword.

145
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,400
Your Highness.

146
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,400
Your Highness.

147
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,400
Sleep for a while.

148
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,400
You didn't sleep either.

149
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,400
I went out to do something.

150
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,400
Uncle Huai,

151
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,400
can I

152
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,400
touch her?

153
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,400
Of course.

154
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,400
That's enough.

155
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,400
Hongye,

156
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,400
someone has walked

157
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,400
the path you want to take.

158
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,400
It's okay to be confused

159
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,400
or to wander.

160
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,400
It's a path to the end.

161
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,400
You are struggling

162
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,400
because you don't want to give up,

163
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,400
right?

164
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,400
I don't want this world

165
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,400
to be like this.

166
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,400
I don't want our child

167
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,400
to be born in such a world.

168
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,400
Then,

169
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,400
for our family,

170
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,400
for the world,

171
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,400
let's do what you think is right.

172
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,400
Greetings, Master Wang Quan.

173
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,400
Greetings, Madam.

174
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,400
It's been months

175
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,400
and you have lost your hair.

176
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,400
You must be having a hard time

177
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,400
with the Yiqi Alliance.

178
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,400
We should all be having a hard time.

179
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,400
You still did it.

180
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,400
But the price is too high.

181
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,400
I'm sorry.

182
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,400
I'm sorry.

183
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,400
I'm sorry.

184
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,400
We have something to discuss with Mount Tushan.

185
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,400
Now the Yiqi Alliance and the Demon Realm

186
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,400
are not only killing and punishing,

187
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,400
but also getting worse and worse.

188
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,400
If this continues,

189
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,400
there will be more and more hatred in this world.

190
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,400
We can't repeat the same mistake.

191
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,400
So the Yiqi Alliance and the Demon Realm

192
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,400
should establish the rules of peace and coexistence,

193
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,400
draw out their own boundaries,

194
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,400
cultivate and cultivate,

195
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,400
and reduce disputes.

196
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,400
The Demon Realm is so big.

197
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,400
It's not up to me to decide.

198
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,400
The Demon Realm is in chaos because of the lack of a leader.

199
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,400
The only one who can rule the Demon Realm

200
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,400
is Mount Tushan.

201
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,400
But why should I do

202
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,400
such a thing?

203
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,400
Isn't it good to live a happy life

204
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,400
in my Mount Tushan?

205
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,400
I can guarantee on behalf of my sister

206
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,400
that the Mount Tushan and the Demon Realm

207
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,400
will never invade the Yiqi Alliance.

208
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,400
But the rest

209
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,400
is difficult to do.

210
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,400
But...

211
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,400
But what?

212
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,400
The greater the ability, the greater the responsibility?

213
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,400
Master Wang Quan,

214
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,400
where did you get your white hair?

215
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,400
Did you sacrifice

216
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,400
all your responsibilities

217
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,400
for happiness?

218
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,400
People are not like demons.

219
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,400
In a few decades,

220
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,400
shouldn't we

221
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,400
cherish the present?

222
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,400
All right.

223
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,400
The scenery of Mount Tushan is good these days.

224
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,400
The Guqin Tree is also being repaired.

225
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,400
Master, why don't you stay here with your wife

226
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,400
and get some rest?

227
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,400
Thank you.

228
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,400
The world is so comfortable.

229
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,400
Yes.

230
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,400
The scenery here is also beautiful.

231
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,400
It seems that you are not surprised

232
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,400
by the rejection of Mount Tushan.

233
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,400
I came here to see the mountain.

234
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,400
But I haven't seen Mount Tushan yet.

235
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,400
I know the result.

236
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,400
Such a big thing

237
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,400
can't be decided in one move.

238
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,400
It always takes a process.

239
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,400
Huaizhu,

240
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,400
there is a saying in Mount Tushan.

241
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,400
You are right.

242
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,400
We all think that life is long.

243
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,400
There are many things we can do.

244
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,400
We always think of starting something

245
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,400
at a certain point.

246
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,400
Or we don't wait

247
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,400
for the most important moment

248
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,400
to come.

249
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,400
And now,

250
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,400
I am very happy

251
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,400
to have you and the child

252
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,400
by my side.

253
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,400
I am also contented.

254
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,400
Me too.

255
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,400
Let's go out for a walk.

256
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,400
I want to go to the Bitter Tree.

257
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,400
I will go with you.

258
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,400
It's hard to come to Mount Tushan.

259
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,400
Why don't you go to the market?

260
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,400
See what you can buy.

261
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,400
Don't worry.

262
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,400
Okay.

263
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,400
I will go to the Bitter Tree later.

264
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,400
I will go with you.

265
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,400
I will go with you.

266
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,400
Okay.

267
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,400
You have changed a lot.

268
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,400
Yes.

269
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,400
It's the season of falling flowers.

270
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,400
Different seasons

271
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,400
have different beauty.

272
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,400
Your root has been damaged.

273
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,400
You are injured so much.

274
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,400
You know you are not much younger.

275
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,400
Even so,

276
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,400
do you still want to use the Eastern Spirit Blood

277
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,400
to make you faint?

278
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,400
This time,

279
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,400
I have a young generation of elite elite.

280
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,400
Although I killed the black fox,

281
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,400
you sent a letter to me

282
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,400
that the Black Bone Love Book is still there.

283
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,400
But the black fox

284
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,400
will still come back.

285
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,400
The child who is combined with the Wangquan family

286
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,400
will have the strongest talent.

287
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,400
He

288
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,400
will be the hope to kill the black fox.

289
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,400
Is that all?

290
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,400
The most important thing

291
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,400
is the red eyes.

292
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,400
How to stop the wind

293
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,400
How to stop the clouds

294
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,400
The sorrowful flag falls and the dust is covered

295
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,400
Like a wind

296
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,400
The face of the world

297
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,400
is less than the previous one.

298
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,400
I also envy

299
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,400
the love that is deep in the heart

300
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,400
People and medicine can be used for a lifetime.

301
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,400
The wind is like a wind

302
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,400
But me and Hongyan

303
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,400
seem to have used all our luck

304
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,400
just by meeting each other.

305
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,400
The wish that I can't put out

306
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,400
Everyone he cherishes

307
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,400
Everyone

308
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,400
has left him one by one.

309
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,400
Now

310
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,400
even I

311
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,400
I don't understand

312
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,400
Why did God treat him like this

313
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,400
after he gave up so much time?

314
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,400
So

315
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,400
I beg you

316
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,400
to accompany him

317
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,400
for me.

318
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,400
Aizhu

319
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,400
Although the time is short

320
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,400
I will love him

321
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,400
infinitely

322
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,400
in a limited time.

323
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,400
I made it myself.

324
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,400
Is it beautiful?

325
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,400
It's beautiful.

326
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,400
Don't cry.

327
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,400
The wind and the sand are too big

328
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,400
to see.

329
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,400
I'm lost.

330
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,400
Put it on for me.

331
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,400
OK.

332
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,400
It's beautiful.

333
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,400
Let's go home.

334
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,400
Let's go.

335
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,400
Love in the world

336
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,400
is unclear

337
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,400
But you can feel

338
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,400
the happiness

339
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,400
that makes others

340
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,400
happy

341
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,400
among those who love each other.

342
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,400
I'm sorry

343
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,400
I didn't know

344
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,400
the happiness

345
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,400
that makes others happy.

346
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,400
And I

347
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,400
was blinded for the first time.

348
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,400
Love

349
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,400
may really

350
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,400
exceed life and death.

351
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,400
Under the joint efforts

352
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,400
of Tushan and Hongye

353
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,400
The human and demon are finally divided.

354
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,400
The demon world is full of resources

355
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,400
There is no need to fight anymore.

356
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,400
War and fire stop

357
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,400
and the peace is temporarily over.

358
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,400
So,

359
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,400
why

360
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,400
do you

361
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,400
want to

362
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,400
kill Tushan

363
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,400
and Youtian?

364
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,400
Huai Zhu,

365
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,400
I have an idea.

366
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,400
Replace whatever

367
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,400
the name of our child

368
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,400
by the name of Fugui.

369
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,320
Between the family

370
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,680
thanks...

371
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,080
But you can't!

372
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,360
Then what?

373
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,960
From now on,

374
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,840
this is our kid's sword.

375
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,680
I will give it to him

376
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,880
and teach him the skills.

377
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,900
We only want to thank you.

378
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,240
Our life was very happy these days.

379
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,220
Happiness seems to come back to

380
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,960
that time.

381
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,780
We were close enemy,

382
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,440
we died with each other blossoming.

383
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,840
conotype have written a deep texture.

384
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,160
I'm sorry.

385
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:18,720
He's born.

386
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:19,840
He's born!

387
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,600
Thank you, Master.

388
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,960
Madam gave birth to a young master.

389
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,760
How is Madam?

390
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,880
Madam...

391
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,080
She...

392
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:31,480
Madam.

393
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,040
Step aside!

394
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,360
Huizhu.

395
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:39,920
Why?

396
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,360
Why did she vomit blood when she gave birth to a child?

397
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,360
Master, I don't know either.

398
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,280
Just now,

399
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,760
when Madam gave birth to a young master,

400
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,360
she vomited blood and fainted.

401
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,160
Huizhu.

402
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:52,760
Huizhu.

403
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,240
You...

404
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,200
Huizhu.

405
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,360
Huizhu.

406
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,520
Huizhu.

407
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,320
Huizhu.

408
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,120
Why are you in such a state?

409
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,880
I'm sorry.

410
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,360
That day,

411
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,000
the wind blew in the east.

412
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,920
I was scared and weak.

413
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,560
I thought

414
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,960
he did it on purpose.

415
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,360
He wanted to marry me off.

416
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,800
Since then,

417
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,680
my wish

418
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,240
has been fulfilled.

419
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,440
I've been

420
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,520
making great progress here.

421
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,200
I just hope

422
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,240
I can spend more

423
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,840
time with you

424
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:16,560
and my child.

425
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,360
My Kingdom

426
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,600
is about to go grand.

427
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,840
I'm afraid that I can't.

428
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,720
Why?

429
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,800
Why didn't you

430
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,760
tell me sooner?

431
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,800
My child.

432
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,360
My child.

433
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,600
Let me...

434
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,620
Wow.

435
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,940
That's so good.

436
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,140
Hong wearing.

437
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,520
I.

438
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,520
I still have one wish.

439
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,520
Leave.

440
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,520
Don't come in.

441
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:24,520
Guest Couple

442
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,680
The best Housing trims in life

443
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,280
are likeяни

444
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,520
Let's try it.

445
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,980
So what should I do with you?

446
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,340
How should I make you stop?

447
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,020
These leaders

448
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:17,980
Let's see

449
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,520
I want to make a deal with you.

450
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,520
First, you must not make any move.

451
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,520
Second, you must not leave me alone.

452
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,520
Third, grab my sword and stab me.

453
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,520
Fourth, you must not let me go.

454
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,520
Fifth, you must not let me go.

455
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,520
You must not let me go.

456
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,520
Young Master Wang Quan,

457
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,520
let's part here.

458
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,520
Let's not meet again.

459
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,520
I'll let you go.

460
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,520
In order to save me,

461
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,520
why did you make such a decision?

462
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,520
I never thought about that.

463
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,520
Then what did you think?

464
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,520
I can't lose you.

465
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,520
I still want to be with you

466
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,520
when you are gone.

467
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,520
When you are riding your horse,

468
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,520
on your Robinson,

469
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,520
there's something bothering me.

470
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,520
When you are riding your horse,

471
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,520
there's something bothering me.

472
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,520
Even if I tell you nothing,

473
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,520
I still want to see you.

474
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,520
At least I want to be free from ME.

475
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,520
When you come back.

476
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:02,520
I'm afraid that I can't see your true face.

477
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:07,520
I've forgotten my way back.

478
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,520
I'm wandering in the wilderness.

479
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,520
I have no way to go.

480
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:17,520
I'll take the moon and the tree as my home.

481
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:24,520
I'll never forget your thoughts.

482
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,520
I'll give you a warm sky

483
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,520
and look up at the sky.

484
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,520
Even though time has passed,

485
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,520
I'll still see you.

486
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:40,520
I'll be with you forever.

487
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:45,520
I'll be with you forever.

488
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,520
I'll be with you forever.

489
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:51,520
I'll be with you forever.

490
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:54,520
I'll be with you forever.

491
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:58,520
I'll be with you forever.

492
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:01,520
Please let me go.

493
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,520
And...

494
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:10,520
never give up.

495
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:14,520
Find your way back.

496
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,520
Because...

497
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,520
I'm a kind person.

498
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:28,520
I'm always a kind person.

499
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,520
I...

500
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,520
want...

501
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,520
to see the stars.

502
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:43,520
Love is like a first meeting.

503
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:48,520
I'll wipe away the past with my sword.

504
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:51,520
I'll give you a warm sky

505
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,520
and look up at the sky.

506
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,520
Even though time has passed,

507
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,520
I'll still see you.

508
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:03,520
I'll be with you forever.

509
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,520
I don't know how to read poems,

510
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,520
sing,

511
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,520
play the zither,

512
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,520
or play the calligraphy.

513
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,520
I don't know how to cook,

514
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,520
wash clothes, or fold the quilt.

515
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,520
I'm good at fighting and fighting.

516
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,520
How is it?

517
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,520
Disappointed?

518
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:30,520
I'll be with you forever.

519
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,520
I'll be with you forever.

520
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,520
Even though time has passed,

521
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:39,520
I'll still see you.

522
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,520
Love is like a first meeting.

523
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:46,520
I'll be with you forever.

524
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:52,520
I'll be with you forever.

525
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:23,520
I'll be with you forever.

526
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:53,520
I'll be with you forever.

527
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:23,520
Mom, I'm here to see you.

528
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,520
Let's go.

529
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,520
Let's go in.

530
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,520
Let's go.

531
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,520
Since then,

532
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:05,520
all the Yijin Sects have been training,

533
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,520
cultivating,

534
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,520
and educating the talented

535
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,520
to develop their skills.

536
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:22,520
Let's go.

537
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:52,520
Greetings, new master.

538
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,520
These changes

539
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,520
will become the future

540
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:59,520
of the Yijin Sect.

541
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,520
And Wang Quan and Hongye

542
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,520
will use their strength

543
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,520
to revive Wang Quan

544
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,520
and bring the weak Yijin Sect

545
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,520
to revive their valley.

546
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,520
The Yijin Sect

547
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,520
has been a stronghold

548
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,520
of the Yijin Sect

549
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,520
for a long time.

550
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,520
They will re-establish

551
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:22,520
the wisdom of the two realms.

552
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,520
Let's go.

553
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:21,520
Greetings, Master Wang Quan.

554
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:51,520
The End

555
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:22,520
The End

556
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:51,520
The End

557
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:22,520
The End

558
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:52,520
The End

559
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:22,520
The End
