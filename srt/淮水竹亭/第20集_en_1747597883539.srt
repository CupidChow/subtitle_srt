1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,920
't worry there's nothing that will not let you off

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,160
Love and hate are both

3
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,040
Flowing

4
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,480
With tears as the wind

5
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,720
The sky is as deep as the boat

6
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,960
Don't turn back and keep walking

7
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,760
Life and death are in front of you

8
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,280
From the fire to the fire

9
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,520
Whose love

10
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,040
Is more vast than the universe

11
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,280
Don't turn back and keep walking

12
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,160
Life and death are in front of you

13
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,640
From the fire to the fire

14
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,880
Whose love

15
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,560
Is more vast than the universe

16
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,520
It's me

17
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,000
The Long Ballad

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,080
The Noblest Man In The Water

19
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:55,680
Episode 1

20
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,160
Go!

21
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,400
A'Cui, look at this.

22
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,880
Brother Yi, thank you for coming to see me.

23
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:14,800
Here.

24
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,120
The dance is ahead.

25
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,240
Let's go and have a look.

26
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,200
Good.

27
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:22,880
Good.

28
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,240
Good.

29
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:26,960
Good.

30
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:31,640
Good.

31
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,400
Good.

32
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,720
Good.

33
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,640
There's more.

34
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,920
Good.

35
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,920
Good.

36
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,000
Good.

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,560
Good.

38
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,720
Boy, this is difficult.

39
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,680
No.

40
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,680
Good!

41
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,320
Brother Yitang, I like you!

42
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,320
Good!

43
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,160
You're pretty good! Look!

44
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,160
Good!

45
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,440
You're talking to me?

46
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,680
Brother Yitang, I like you!

47
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:33,080
I'm not asking for money because of your kindness and tolerance.

48
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,080
Trust and respect.

49
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,280
You also protect me.

50
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,280
You stand for me.

51
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,280
You also silently stand behind me.

52
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,280
I feel that every day,

53
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,280
I feel very excited when I'm with you.

54
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,280
I won't give such a good you

55
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,280
to someone else.

56
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,280
I know what you're thinking.

57
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,280
No matter what happens in the future,

58
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,280
I will be confident to face it with you.

59
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,280
Even if we're together for a year,

60
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,280
a month, a day,

61
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,280
I just want to be with you.

62
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,280
Brother Yitang,

63
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,280
are you willing to give me this chance?

64
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,280
I'm willing to give you this chance.

65
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,280
I'm willing to give you this chance.

66
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,280
I'm willing to give you this chance.

67
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,280
I'm willing to give you this chance.

68
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,280
I'm willing to give you this chance.

69
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,280
I'm willing to give you this chance.

70
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,280
I'm willing to give you this chance.

71
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,280
I'm willing to give you this chance.

72
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,280
I'm willing to give you this chance.

73
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,280
I'm willing to give you this chance.

74
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,280
I'm willing to give you this chance.

75
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,280
I'm willing to give you this chance.

76
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,840
What is the reason for my desire?

77
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,520
What should I do?

78
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,280
I feel like I'm having a daughter.

79
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,120
If Yang Yi is not good to her,

80
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,320
I'll break her legs.

81
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,840
He's our second brother.

82
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,200
You can beat him.

83
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,600
The fireworks are so good.

84
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,480
Yes.

85
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,040
The fireworks will make the atmosphere better.

86
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,000
If only my brother were here.

87
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,720
Why didn't you say anything?

88
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,840
You have a daughter.

89
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,880
What do you think?

90
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,560
Who put the fireworks?

91
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,000
I don't think it was arranged by Qingmu.

92
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,520
Yes.

93
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,920
Who is so talented?

94
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,120
Oh, you're the only one I'm in love with

95
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,160
It looks smooth.

96
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,600
Your fireworks are also friendships.

97
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:35,920
I really appreciate it.

98
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,480
Then in return,

99
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,880
you can money it with me.

100
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,560
Oh, you're the only one I'm in love with

101
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,680
I'm still lonely next to you

102
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,840
Oh, you know I won't be weak

103
00:06:51,840 --> 00:07:00,240
I fell in love with you, the warmest start

104
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,840
The day I knew the end

105
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:13,440
I fell in love with you, the warmest start

106
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,240
The night is cold as water

107
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,840
I see the star of the female bird

108
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,840
I see the star of the female bird

109
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:35,840
I remember the first one who told me the story

110
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,240
It must be a gentle person

111
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,840
It's my mother

112
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,840
Her name is also nice

113
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,840
Jiang Juanxue

114
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,840
A very poetic name

115
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,840
Yes

116
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,840
Although she has died for many years

117
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,840
I can't remember some things clearly

118
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,840
But every time I see the star

119
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,840
I will remember her

120
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,840
Remember what she told me

121
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,840
I remember those words

122
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,840
A'Zhu

123
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,840
Look at the stars in the sky

124
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,840
How beautiful

125
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,840
Although the weather is bad tonight

126
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,840
But wait for the wind to pass

127
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,840
The stars will still come out

128
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,840
The stars are coming out

129
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,840
Maybe one day

130
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,840
Darkness will take over your life

131
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,840
But you must believe

132
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,840
There will be a star

133
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,840
Light up your way

134
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,840
My mother left me a puzzle

135
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,840
I have to find the answer

136
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,840
Do you need me to help you?

137
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,840
This is what I have to face

138
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,840
What are you laughing at?

139
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,840
You seem to be suspicious of me today

140
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,840
You seem to be suspicious of me today

141
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,840
Are you leaving too?

142
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,840
I will leave for a long time

143
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,840
But you don't have to worry

144
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,840
I will come back before the end of the summer

145
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,840
I will come back before the end of the summer

146
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,840
I won't worry

147
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,840
I won't worry

148
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,840
Because in this world

149
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,840
There is someone who can kill you

150
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,840
I want you

151
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,840
I'm going to the Demon Realm

152
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,840
What's up?

153
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,840
Miss, you told me

154
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,840
If there is any information about Zhang Zheng's family

155
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,840
I must report it to you as soon as possible

156
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,840
What information?

157
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,840
Zhang's family dressed up and entered the Demon Kingdom

158
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,840
Demon Kingdom?

159
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,840
How many demons do you have?

160
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,840
You?

161
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,840
See

162
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,840
This is already the third time during this month

163
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,840
This month, the demon kingdom

164
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,840
what's the case?

165
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,840
and mountains, like that

166
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,840
ladies

167
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,840
Is Zhang Zhang's family's importance to you?

168
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,840
Do you want to say something?

169
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,840
He never showed up

170
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,120
when we came to the brothel.

171
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,720
He wasn't like this before.

172
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,720
When we were in the same window,

173
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,000
he was nice to me.

174
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,760
He saved my life once.

175
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,960
Why isn't he here yet?

176
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,240
He's just ahead.

177
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,880
This place doesn't look like

178
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,480
a place where the flowers bloom.

179
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,440
Did you make a mistake?

180
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,840
No.

181
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,360
What are you doing?

182
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,240
We're in the same window. Stop it.

183
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,440
Miss Qingmu,

184
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,480
aren't you amazing?

185
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,840
No one can see you.

186
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,320
Without light,

187
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,800
I'll see how you get out of this dreamy formation.

188
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:35,920
Let's go.

189
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:36,840
Stop!

190
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,720
Don't go!

191
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,040
Don't go!

192
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,600
Father!

193
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,600
Mother!

194
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,920
Miss Qingmu, are you okay?

195
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,560
I'm here to save you.

196
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,240
The wound is broken.

197
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,680
Don't be afraid.

198
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,360
I'll take you out.

199
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,800
Let's go.

200
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,640
These are all the flowers of your inner fear.

201
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,240
Don't be afraid.

202
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,880
I'll protect you.

203
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,880
Don't be afraid.

204
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,240
I'll protect you.

205
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,240
Don't be afraid.

206
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,240
I'll protect you.

207
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,200
I'm here.

208
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,960
It's okay.

209
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,920
Let's go.

210
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,760
Hurry.

211
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,720
Thank you, Zhang Tongchuan.

212
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,920
Our Tongchuan has been here for many years.

213
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,760
Although he doesn't talk much,

214
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,360
he's very nice to me.

215
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,040
He's a very nice person.

216
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,360
What happened later?

217
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,200
Later,

218
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,320
he became the master of Zhang Zheng's family.

219
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,960
Since then,

220
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,600
he's changed a lot.

221
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,720
You've seen it.

222
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,720
I've become the master of Ruyi Pavilion.

223
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,520
He invited me as the owner of the building.

224
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,520
He rejected all of them.

225
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,520
Why?

226
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,200
I don't know.

227
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,040
He's ruthless and I'm a coward.

228
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,360
Miss, you don't have to mind him.

229
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,400
There are many people who admire our Miss.

230
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,240
But I just can't let him go.

231
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,760
When you're young,

232
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,600
sometimes it's your whole life.

233
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,320
Zhang Zheng,

234
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,840
what are you going to do

235
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,640
in the Demon Kingdom?

236
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,320
It's your turn, Brother San.

237
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,520
Brother San, look at this.

238
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,880
It's not easy.

239
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,040
Brother San,

240
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,400
this time you went to the Demon Kingdom

241
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,920
to investigate the Black Lake.

242
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,920
I'm afraid you can't.

243
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,800
Do you want to tell Sister Huai Zhu?

244
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,520
She has something important to do.

245
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,920
I don't want to bother her.

246
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:42,600
How is it?

247
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,120
I'm good, right?

248
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,680
You two just got together.

249
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,800
You have to separate.

250
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,000
Can you do it?

251
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,720
How about

252
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,320
you go back and accompany your sister-in-law?

253
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,920
I'll go with Brother Yi Tan.

254
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,520
What Xiaomei said makes sense.

255
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,760
Have you arranged

256
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,120
the people who will take over the Demon Kingdom?

257
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,320
Don't worry, Brother.

258
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,920
I've arranged the best one.

259
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,720
Who?

260
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,520
Me.

261
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,520
You?

262
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,320
The head of the Demon Kingdom

263
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,920
has always been angry with Brother.

264
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,920
If this mission is not done well,

265
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,520
it will reveal Brother's whereabouts.

266
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,320
So I decided

267
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,720
to take the role of the head of the Demon Kingdom

268
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,720
to separate the Demon Kingdom.

269
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,920
The sun is coming out from the south today.

270
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,520
Miss Qingmu is going to take the role.

271
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,720
Can't you?

272
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,320
Well...

273
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,320
But I heard that

274
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,120
the Demon Kingdom is very far away.

275
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,520
And the weather is very dry.

276
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,520
It's not good for your skin care.

277
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,520
Don't worry.

278
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,920
I've thought about it.

279
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,120
And my rouge and water powder

280
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,520
are on the way.

281
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,920
You have to get up early for the mission.

282
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,120
If I get up early,

283
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,520
is there anyone more suitable than you?

284
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,320
It's decided.

285
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,520
I'll go to the Demon Kingdom to explore the way.

286
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,120
When you arrive,

287
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,520
someone will pick up.

288
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:02,920
I'm leaving.

289
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,920
You're leaving?

290
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,720
Yes.

291
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:12,920
Yitan,

292
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,520
you just saw something with your eyes.

293
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,120
It's not normal for Sister Qingmu.

294
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,520
Qingmu can do things without worry.

295
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,920
Before I go to the Demon Kingdom,

296
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,120
I have one last big thing to do.

297
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:31,920
Yang Yitan.

298
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,720
I'm sorry.

299
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,480
Yitan,

300
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,520
what are you doing?

301
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,720
It's Bien,

302
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,520
he's lying outside.

303
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,120
Yitan,

304
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,120
Alright,

305
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,120
I don't put up with it.

306
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,320
in my catch up with Jingxing,

307
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,360
have you ever looked down on me?

308
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,400
Don't bully him!

309
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,400
Please rest assured, sir.

310
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,720
I'll get prepared.

311
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,920
I won't miss out on anything.

312
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:25,300
Have your grandpa and uncle carefully go.

313
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,800
Got it.

314
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,300
Arrogant!

315
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,360
You married a lady with a foot.

316
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,920
What's the hurry?

317
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,360
Yang Yang. Yang Yang.

318
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:41,840
Father.

319
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,160
What's the big news?

320
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,760
You're so loud in the morning.

321
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,520
It's a big news.

322
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,280
Go to the butler's place

323
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,680
and prepare the wedding gift.

324
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,360
Go to Wang Quan's place with me.

325
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,080
It's a good thing.

326
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,840
My grandson.

327
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,800
Please look forward to it.

328
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,360
Early December.

329
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,480
How many months to prepare?

330
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,880
Miss Wang Quan will get married.

331
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,000
She must dress up.

332
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,160
But Yang's family is not like Wang Quan.

333
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,800
I wonder if you like the wedding gift.

334
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,880
Our A Zui doesn't lack gold, silver and jewelry.

335
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,000
Of course.

336
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:25,960
I just don't know

337
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,240
why A Zui

338
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,000
will marry Yang's family.

339
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,000
Is she the young mistress of Yang's family?

340
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,400
She must be the mistress of the family.

341
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,920
When Miss Wang Quan marries into the family,

342
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:46,440
I'll pass on the position of the mistress to her.

343
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,200
I have a suggestion.

344
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,040
I don't dare.

345
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,960
After all, she's the mistress of Wang Quan's family.

346
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:58,960
She's a senior.

347
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,320
She's not as good as Wang Quan.

348
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,560
I heard that you owe a lot of debts outside.

349
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,520
No.

350
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,520
Absolutely not.

351
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,560
You can't hear rumors.

352
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,760
But there are your handwriting and handwriting on it.

353
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,760
Young mistress.

354
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,520
Of course.

355
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,320
Since we're a family,

356
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:32,520
I'll take care of the matter of Uncle.

357
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,800
Thank you, Young Mistress Wang Quan.

358
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,440
Wang Quan's Mansion is indeed the best place in the Yi Qi Alliance.

359
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,440
How can our family marry Wang Quan's family?

360
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,360
It's really a blessing in disguise.

361
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,680
No hurry.

362
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,400
I have another gift for Uncle.

363
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,880
I bought two mines.

364
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,480
The jade mine.

365
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,480
Young Mistress, you're so generous.

366
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,480
So, we can't wait for the good business.

367
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,560
I'll go to Nanchui to make money.

368
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,560
Nanchui?

369
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,080
No.

370
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,560
Nanchui people are mixed.

371
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,680
Have you prepared the carriage?

372
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,880
Yes.

373
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,000
I have a family.

374
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,960
Young Mistress Yang's wife and the concubine's house,

375
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,560
and the three houses and the family,

376
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,960
and the seven children,

377
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,520
are all gathered.

378
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,880
The carriage outside the mansion

379
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,160
seems to have started fighting.

380
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,560
Why don't you send me to Nanchui to make money?

381
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,120
Well...

382
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,320
Please.

383
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,000
Father, you're so mean.

384
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,120
I'm very satisfied with the gift.

385
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,680
It's settled on the fifth of December.

386
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,800
She has been sent away.

387
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,080
Before she got on the carriage,

388
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,040
I've asked her wife and concubine

389
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,520
to catch her face.

390
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,160
Tell Duhuang

391
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,560
that I don't want her to leave Nanchui.

392
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:22,800
Yes.

393
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,040
Come out.

394
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,120
Did you hear that?

395
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,400
I heard that you cheated people

396
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,160
and drove them to Nanchui without a trace.

397
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,720
You also told them never to come back.

398
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,520
Cui.

399
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,280
Take it.

400
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,480
We ate a few apples

401
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,720
that were given to the immortals.

402
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,960
We're safe and sound.

403
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,680
If you object,

404
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,680
I'll take it.

405
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,400
If you object,

406
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,520
I can call her back.

407
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,000
I object.

408
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,560
Because you're so nice to her.

409
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,880
You bought a mine for her.

410
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,160
You bought two.

411
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,480
I bought

412
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,480
the reputation of your after-you-go-to-Yang family.

413
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,160
That's not true.

414
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:15,520
I'm angry when I think of Aunt Yang Yan.

415
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,800
Then think about it.

416
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,600
Why did she buy

417
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,200
such a profitable mine?

418
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,280
Is there any possibility

419
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,240
that she has any bad debts or enemies?

420
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,120
That's right.

421
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,000
That's my brother.

422
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,520
He's so cruel.

423
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,480
Cui.

424
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:48,680
I...

425
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:52,520
Cui.

426
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,200
I want to ask you a question

427
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,920
and I'll send it to you.

428
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,560
Before Partizan

429
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,040
ran here and out of Meltdown,

430
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,480
how are you and Pelletie doing?

431
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,080
He said

432
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,320
you're a vigor.

433
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,480
After Bray.

434
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,520
I know.

435
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,340
Yes.

436
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,400
For you,

437
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:44,820
under the makeshift

438
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,940
I am even ready to meet up with you.

439
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:47,620
That is all,

440
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:20,620
I used the Demon-Witching Cultivation for a long time.

441
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,320
I hope that this time,

442
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,620
I can break through the limits of my bloodline

443
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:27,020
and manipulate the real life.

444
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,120
Qin Ren Feng.

445
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:51,620
Tell me.

446
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:55,120
What can I get from your arm?

447
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:59,120
It's naturally opportunity and power.

448
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,120
Opportunity?

449
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,120
I'm not sure.

450
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,120
I'm not sure.

451
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,120
I'm not sure.

452
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,120
I'm not sure.

453
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,120
I'm not sure.

454
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,120
I'm not sure.

455
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,120
I'm not sure.

456
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,620
Opportunity and power.

457
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:21,120
Opportunity and power?

458
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,620
With your ability,

459
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,120
the position you can climb is limited.

460
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,120
Human life is short.

461
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,120
You may work hard for a lifetime

462
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:32,620
and only get into a small head of a blind man.

463
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,620
Okay.

464
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,120
Tell me.

465
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,620
What can I do for you?

466
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:46,120
Do you know where the Eastern Huai Zhu is now?

467
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,620
They went to the Dream Tower of the Demon-Witching Cultivation

468
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,620
to get the West Martial Arts.

469
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,120
West Martial Arts?

470
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,120
Qin Ren Feng.

471
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,120
Your priority now

472
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,120
is to find the Tower Master

473
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,620
before the Eastern Huai Zhu

474
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,120
and get the West Martial Arts.

475
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,620
Why should they listen to me?

476
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,120
Go and send a letter to the Demon-Witching Cultivation Master.

477
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,120
Tell him

478
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:10,120
that Wang Quanhong is entering the Demon-Witching Cultivation.

479
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,120
The Demon-Witching Cultivation Master hates him just as much as you.

480
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,120
He will help you.

481
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:19,120
Now is the best time to kill Wang Quanhong.

482
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:28,120
Wang Quanhong and the Eastern Huai Zhu went to the Demon-Witching Cultivation.

483
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,620
They are changing the fate.

484
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,120
Lord Jiuhuo.

485
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,120
You must stop them.

486
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,120
When I have some rest,

487
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,120
I will go back and handle this matter myself.

488
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,620
But it's too slow.

489
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,120
Your demon core is badly injured.

490
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,620
The magic treasure has been destroyed.

491
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,620
It's easy to go back and impeach it.

492
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,620
But the desire of human will never stop.

493
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,620
I don't want to be a pawn anymore.

494
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,620
That Jin Ren Feng from the Sacred Fire Manor

495
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,620
hopes that he won't let me down.

496
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,620
It's too cold.

497
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,620
It's a little cold.

498
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,620
It's cold.

499
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,620
It's okay.

500
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,620
It's cold.

501
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,620
Pick some more.

502
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,620
Here you are.

503
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,620
Sorry to keep you waiting.

504
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,620
Thank you.

505
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,620
Welcome.

506
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,620
Sister.

507
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,620
Is this the Demon-Witching Cultivation?

508
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,620
So many demons.

509
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:32,620
It's interesting.

510
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,620
The master has ordered

511
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,120
to close the gate.

512
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,120
Everyone,

513
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,620
check your identity.

514
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,120
Everyone,

515
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,120
don't move.

516
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:46,620
Anyone who moves,

517
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,620
will be handled by the spy of the First Qingmeng.

518
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,620
Search.

519
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,620
Lord.

520
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:55,620
What's going on?

521
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,620
Recently, the first Qingmeng

522
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,120
has some disciples from the Shi family

523
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,620
who have come to my Demon-Witching Cultivation.

524
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,120
All the guests in this restaurant

525
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,120
have no identity cards.

526
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,620
But they don't have demons

527
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,620
with their identity cards.

528
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,120
Take them away to investigate.

529
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,120
Wait.

530
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,120
Who are you?

531
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,120
Let them go.

532
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,120
Take away their identity cards.

533
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,620
We are from the Pulan clan.

534
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,620
Pulan clan?

535
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,620
Where are your demons?

536
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,120
I didn't bring them out.

537
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,120
You are dressed like a nobleman,

538
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,120
but you don't have demons.

539
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,620
Suspicious.

540
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,120
So what if I didn't bring them?

541
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,620
I didn't bring my brain.

542
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,120
Don't talk nonsense.

543
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,120
Take them away.

544
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,120
Come on.

545
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,620
Move.

546
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,120
Let's go.

547
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,120
Chief Zhou.

548
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,120
Where is the card?

549
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,120
Over there.

550
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,120
Go.

551
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,620
Yours.

552
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:55,620
Where is the card?

553
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,620
Yours.

554
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,120
Madam.

555
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,120
Go and tell Ruilou

556
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:01,620
that they look like

557
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,620
from the Sacred Fire Manor.

558
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,120
Okay.

559
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,120
Let's go.

560
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,120
Go.

561
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,120
Sir.

562
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,120
It's almost dinner time.

563
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,120
Even if you don't let them go,

564
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,120
at least give them some food.

565
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,120
Stop it.

566
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:24,620
I'm busy now.

567
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,120
They only have a small bite.

568
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,620
I'll deal with you later.

569
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,120
Who is so bold?

570
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,120
How dare you arrest the lady of the Erzhu family?

571
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,120
Go.

572
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,120
Sister.

573
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,120
My lady.

574
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,120
I finally found them.

575
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,620
Why are you here so late?

576
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,120
I...

577
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,120
What did you say?

578
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,120
Are they from the Erzhu family?

579
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:19,620
Or are they my lady?

580
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,620
The lady of the Erzhu family

581
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,120
doesn't bring her ID card

582
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,620
or waist.

583
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,120
They're all over the street.

584
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:35,120
The ID card is here.

585
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,120
Come on.

586
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,120
Open the door.

587
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,120
Hurry up.

588
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,120
Hurry up.

589
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,120
You...

590
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,120
Why are you attacking me?

591
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,120
Don't be so aggressive.

592
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,620
We don't have to block the door.

593
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,120
You...

594
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,120
My lady.

595
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,120
I'm sorry for being late.

596
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,120
I've made you suffer.

597
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,120
Sister.

598
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,120
Let's go.

599
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,120
Yes.

600
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,120
Let's go.

601
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,120
Stop.

602
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,120
The ID card is not fake.

603
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,120
But the state preceptor gave a death order.

604
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,120
We don't dare to be careless.

605
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,120
So, my ladies,

606
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,120
can you explain it to us?

607
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,120
Explain what?

608
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,120
My ladies.

609
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,120
You just don't have ID card or waist.

610
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,120
Why didn't you get hurt

611
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,120
when you were caught?

612
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,120
Squat.

613
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,120
We haven't

614
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,120
settled the score with you.

615
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,120
You caught the lady

616
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,120
of the Erzhu family for no reason.

617
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,120
Now you're questioning our lady.

618
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,120
You deserve to be punished.

619
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:26,120
If you don't give a reasonable explanation,

620
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,120
I'll make this old man

621
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,120
a scapegoat today.

622
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,120
We're not leaving.

623
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,120
Look at this old house.

624
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,120
It's full of cockroaches and rats.

625
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,120
Look at this dirty place.

626
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,120
Get your waist out.

627
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,120
I can walk on my own.

628
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,120
Let's go.

629
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,120
Sister.

630
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,120
Wait for me.

631
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,120
Let's go.

632
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,120
What's the hurry?

633
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,120
Slow down.

634
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,120
Brother, slow down.

635
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,120
Give it to me.

636
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,120
I'll take it.

637
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,120
Goodbye, my ladies.

638
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,120
It's so dangerous.

639
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,120
If we delay for a while,

640
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,120
we'll be caught.

641
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,120
I'll go with you.

642
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,120
I'll go with you.

643
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,120
I'll go with you.

644
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,120
I'll go with you.

645
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,120
It's you two.

646
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,120
I didn't see it.

647
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,120
How are you?

648
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,120
You're not hurt, are you?

649
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,120
I'm fine.

650
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,120
So the ghost that was screaming

651
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,120
was you.

652
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,120
You talked to your savior like that?

653
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,120
That's great.

654
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,120
I didn't expect to meet you here.

655
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,120
I thought...

656
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,120
You can talk.

657
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,120
Why did you touch me?

658
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,120
Sorry, Miss Qinglan.

659
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,120
But, sister,

660
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,120
how did you know

661
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,120
that it was them?

662
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,120
Li Juzhuo wrote it on his hand.

663
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,120
What did he write?

664
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,120
What's the word?

665
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,120
It's gone.

666
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,120
It's gone.

667
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,120
How did you know

668
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,120
that we were here?

669
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,120
I heard that you were caught

670
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,120
in Ruyi Pavilion.

671
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,120
That's a great news.

672
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,120
You're going to

673
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,120
sweep the reputation of the Ghost Valley

674
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,120
if you mention it.

675
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,120
What did I say?

676
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,120
You're going to sweep the reputation

677
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,120
of the Ghost Valley

678
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,120
if you mention it.

679
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,120
What did I say?

680
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,120
Brother, don't be anxious.

681
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,120
Let me think of

682
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,120
a perfect plan.

683
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,120
So...

684
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,120
In a word,

685
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,120
Qingmu Yuan gave us the Demon-Poisoning Talisman.

686
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,120
Thank you.

687
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,120
I don't know what you're doing,

688
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,120
but in this situation,

689
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,120
we'd better...

690
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,120
No better.

691
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,120
We'll go our separate ways.

692
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,120
Now the people who are

693
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,120
following you

694
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,120
are more dangerous.

695
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,120
You're right.

696
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,120
Remember.

697
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,120
Take these two identity cards.

698
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,120
If you have any problem,

699
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,120
come to Ruyi Pavilion.

700
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,120
What about you?

701
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,120
We still have them.

702
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,120
Let's go, sister.

703
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,120
She'll fall on you.

704
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,120
Let's go.

705
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,120
I'm sorry.

706
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,120
I'm sorry.

707
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,120
I'm sorry.

708
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,120
I'm sorry.

709
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,120
I'm sorry.

710
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,120
I'm sorry.

711
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,120
I'm sorry.

712
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,120
I'm sorry.

713
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,120
I'm sorry.

714
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,120
I'm sorry.

715
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,120
I'm sorry.

716
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,120
I'm sorry.

717
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,120
I'm sorry.

718
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,120
I'm sorry.

719
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,120
I'm sorry.

720
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,120
I'm sorry.

721
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,120
I'm sorry.

722
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,120
I'm sorry.

723
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,120
I'm sorry.

724
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,120
I'm sorry.

725
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,120
I'm sorry.

726
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,120
I'm sorry.

727
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,120
I'm sorry.

728
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,120
I'm sorry.

729
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,120
I'm sorry.

730
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,120
I'm sorry.

731
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,120
I'm sorry.

732
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,120
I'm sorry.

733
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,120
I'm sorry.

734
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,120
I'm sorry.

735
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,120
I'm sorry.

736
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,120
I'm sorry.

737
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,120
I'm sorry.

738
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,120
I'm sorry.

739
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,120
I'm sorry.

740
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,120
I'm sorry.

741
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,120
I'm sorry.

742
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,120
I'm sorry.

743
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,120
I'm sorry.

744
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,120
I'm sorry.

745
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,120
I'm sorry.

746
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,120
I'm sorry.

747
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,120
I'm sorry.

748
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,120
I'm sorry.

749
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,120
I'm sorry.

750
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,120
I'm sorry.

751
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,120
I'm sorry.

752
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,120
I'm sorry.

753
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,120
I'm sorry.

754
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,120
I'm sorry.

755
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,120
I'm sorry.

756
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,120
I'm sorry.

757
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,120
I'm sorry.

758
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,120
I'm sorry.

759
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,120
I'm sorry.

760
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,120
I'm sorry.

761
