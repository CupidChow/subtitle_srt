The hairstyle suddenly goes on air

I'm so embarrassed

00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,940

The wind blows, the sky is like a boat

Life goes on

From the fire to the fire

23
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,560
It's you and me

Don't go to Mount Tushan's Bitter Tree

32
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,880
Why?

33
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,040
I can do it alone

34
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,000
But you still can't tap my back

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,680
Because of you

36
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,280
I cannot get what I want

37
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,480
It's the custom in Mount Tushan

38
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,320
Tushan Yaoya said

39
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,160

If You을리

41
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,880
will cause you great harm

42
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,880
I can't let you become like this.

43
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,880
Hongye.

44
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,880
You have your mission.

45
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,280
I also have something I must do.

46
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,080
But your body...

47
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,280
I'm not worried about that.

48
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,480
Because even if my power becomes weaker,

49
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,280
I still have you.

50
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,280
You will protect me.

51
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,480
I'll be waiting for you.

52
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,680
It's almost time.

53
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,480
The last party of the Masked Club before the full-time is not going to be late.

54
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,880
I am Li Quzuo, the second son of the Tao Yuan family.

55
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,680
Be careful.

56
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,880
Wipe it well.

57
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,880
It's because you didn't make the cleaning suit.

58
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,280
You made the cleaning weapon.

59
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,280
Look.

60
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,480
You hit the table leg.

61
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,880
What? So many times.

62
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,880
Brother San.

63
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,880
Brother Yan.

64
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,080
Xiaoqi.

65
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,480
I'll say it again.

66
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,880
Call me Six.

67
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,080
Brother San.

68
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,280
I'll play chess with you.

69
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,280
Catch me.

70
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,280
Watch me.

71
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,480
You...

72
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,080
Give me a hand.

73
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,280
How about this?

74
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,280
Brother Yan.

75
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,480
Where is my brother?

76
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,080
What brother?

77
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,880
I caught him to play the game of chess.

78
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,280
Xiaoqi, come out and help me.

79
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,280
Coming.

80
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,080
Sister Qingmu.

81
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,480
Why are you playing chess with my brother?

82
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,280
Where is your classmate Zhang?

83
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,880
He has something to do today.

84
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,080
So I'm here to help your brother.

85
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,880
You know how to care for others.

86
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,680
Miss Qingmu.

87
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,280
You're so generous.

88
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,280
In the future, we'll all follow this standard.

89
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,880
It depends on my mood.

90
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,080
But if you behave well,

91
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,680
maybe when you come back, you'll have more.

92
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,080
For everyone,

93
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,280
I'll take care of you and Xiaoqi today.

94
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,680
Call me Six.

95
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,880
Six.

96
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,480
Is everyone here?

97
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,880
Welcome.

98
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:21,880
Welcome.

99
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,480
Brother.

100
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,080
These are the good wine I treasured in Ruyi House.

101
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,680
I'll drink it all today.

102
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,480
Come on.

103
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,280
We'll be drunk tonight.

104
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,680
Let's have a toast tonight.

105
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,480
Okay.

106
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,280
Come on.

107
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,680
Let's have a toast.

108
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,080
Cheers.

109

Come on.

111
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,880
Brother.

112
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,080
You haven't arranged

113
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,680
our appearance announcement.

114
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,440
It was in my blood diverting using this knife.

115
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,240
When can I board it?

116
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,000
One.

117
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:28,960
Really?

118
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,760
Li patriarch.

119
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,880
Shut up!

120
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,320
Dong Fangเล ak asкуSpacementedenkeg Marco Li.

121
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,560
He can't be here.

122
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,000
What do you want?

123
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,000
ari!

124
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,960
Fei for you,

125
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,200
No.

126
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:06,580
I

127
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,120
Probably

128
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,000
I

129
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,120
Brother.

130
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:13,960
I

131
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,620
To spread the medicine so that you can eat.

132
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,000
Are you okay?

133
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,280
If it weren't for me,

134
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,280
would my brother and sister-in-law be here today?

135
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,480
Do you know how much I've paid to protect my brother and sister-in-law?

136
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,280
Just...

137
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,080
Just this.

138
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,280
It turns out that I almost broke my leg.

139
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,480
Here, drink.

140
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,080
Let's drink.

141
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,680
Qu Zhou is right.

142
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:37,680
Sit down.

143
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,480
Hurry up and sit.

144
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,680
Sit down.

145
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,680
Stop talking nonsense.

146
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,680
What's wrong with your sister-in-law?

147
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:43,680
Thank you.

148
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,280
It's been a long time.

149
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,280
Fourth Brother has really helped me a lot

150
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,480
in the past few days.

151
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,080
When we get married,

152
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,880
I'll make sure you sit on the main table.

153
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,480
I can sit on the main table.

154
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,880
I can't.

155
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,880
She has to call me Brother Qu Zhuo.

156
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,080
I'll let her do it.

157
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,880
It's disgusting.

158
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,280
Sister-in-law.

159
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,080
Please teach me

160
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,080
how to make our brother

161
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,280
act like an elder brother.

162
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,480
You don't even know.

163
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,080
Look at me.

164
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,680
Do you know how much Brother Qu took the initiative?

165
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,080
He asked me about all kinds of news about you.

166
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,280
He asked me to prepare a lot of things for you

167
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,280
and make you all kinds of gifts.

168
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,280
Drink some water.

169
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,680
Drink some water.

170
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,680
What are you doing?

171
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,480
I didn't drink much.

172
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,080
Anyway,

173
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,480
Zhang Zheng

174
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,480
never wants to get out of my palm in this life.

175
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,080
Look.

176
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,680
The moon is so beautiful tonight.

177
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,280
Tonight,

178
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,880
I just want to see you.

179
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,680
And see you tomorrow.

180
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,880
Get down.

181
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,680
Have you been unscathed

182
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,680
by other people

183
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,080
doing this by yourself?

184
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,320
Not a chance.

185
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,440
You're Coronet.

186
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,480
What happened to him取?

187
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,800
Let me…

188
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,680
Let me see.

189
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,520
What should I do with Fước?

190
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,800
What did she do?

191
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,280
What did she do?

192
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:16,280
I've already told Uncle Fei to prepare the medicinal herbs for Buqi's recovery.

193
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,280
Remember to ask Qi Lan to come and get them.

194
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,280
Zhengzheng...

195
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,280
Qi Zhuang.

196
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,280
What?

197
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,280
I've collected over a thousand talismans

198
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,280
and placed them under your bed.

199
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,280
You're taking off your clothes?

200
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,280
Are you going to take off your thousand talismans to me

201
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,280
or to your thousand talismans?

202
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,280
What nonsense are you talking about?

203
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,280
If you dare to die in front of me,

204
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,280
I'll take all your thousand talismans.

205
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,280
You're really a puppy.

206
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,280
No...

207
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,280
Let me tell you.

208
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,280
Now, someone calls me Brother Dog.

209
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,280
I'm really good.

210
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,280
I'll protect you from now on.

211
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:36,280
I seem to see a sachet under your bed.

212
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,280
For whom?

213
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:43,280
I remember that you've seen it eight hundred times before you came here.

214
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,280
Tell me, who is she?

215
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,280
It's none of your business.

216
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,280
Isn't she pretty?

217
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,280
When will you bring her back?

218
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,280
I'm sleepy.

219
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,280
Let me see. Eight hundred times.

220
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,280
Sleep.

221
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,280
Let me see.

222
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,280
Brother Yi.

223
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,280
Why do you think my alcohol tolerance is so poor?

224
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:12,280
Could it be that my parents have given me a sin?

225
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,280
Sin is the sin of the dust and the wind.

226
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,280
It's not the sin of three cups of wine.

227
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,280
Old acupressure.

228
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,280
Look.

229
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,280
Let me put it on for you.

230
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,280
I'll put it on for you too.

231
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,280
Okay.

232
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,280
Early December.

233
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,280
Our wedding date will not change.

234
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,280
When we come back, we will get married.

235
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,280
Okay.

236
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,280
Brother Yi.

237
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:35,280
Do you like your son or your daughter?

238
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:42,280
I want a soft daughter like Xiaoqi's.

239
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,280
If I can look like you, it would be better.

240
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,280
Your son is like you.

241
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,280
Your son is like me.

242
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,280
He's handsome.

243
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,280
He's good at drinking.

244
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,280
He's a good sister-in-law.

245
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,280
He's a good brother-in-law.

246
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,280
He's a good sister-in-law.

247
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:13,280
I hope that after the mission is over,

248
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,280
we won't take the risk.

249
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,280
I'm not afraid of you.

250
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,280
I won't.

251
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,280
The person I like.

252
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,280
When I was young, I had a childhood sweetheart.

253
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,280
She was good at drawing.

254
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,280
So I learned to draw too.

255
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,280
I'm learning to draw.

256
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,280
If I give you your sachet,

257
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,280
will you hit me?

258
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,280
Chengcheng.

259
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,280
Why don't you wear white clothes?

260
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:09,280
You look the best in white clothes.

261
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,280
I'm sorry.

262
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,280
Be good, Jiu Ruo.

263
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,280
I finally carved you a whole set of weapons.

264
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,280
When I come back,

265
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,280
I will tell you.

266
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,280
I will not only give you a big horse,

267
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:34,280
I am also a big hero.

268
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,280
I will wait for you to come back.

269
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,280
We have a lot to do together.

270
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,280
Wait for me to come back.

271
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:13,280
I still believe in you.

272
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,280
I will wait for you to come back.

273
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,780
Let me think

274
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,280
it's your own call.

275
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,280
God nonsense 저도

276
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,280
The key to Heaven Gate is that

277
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,280
human body who have a high ability

278
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,280
is approaching from behind.

279
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,780
The speed is fast

280
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,780
and it is confusing.

281
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,480
This is a good place.

282
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,680
For many years,

283
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,480
no one has been here.

284
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,280
I want to see

285
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,880
how the people of our family

286
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,680
can have such blood.

287
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,780
7 years ago

288
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,680
You used to be a younger man

289
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,080
with a thick mask.

290
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,880
Now your identity is alienated

291
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,680
and you dare to break the rules.

292
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,080
What a pity,

293
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,680
let me teach you a lesson today.

294
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,520
This world,

295
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,720
has unbreakable bonds.

296
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,000
I've no way to make up our spot.

297
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,000
The border has walls,

298
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,440
and it's as tall as mountains.

299
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,840
The marvelous event

300
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,780
of Love between Two of You

301
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:56,380
That's right. This is the magic treasure I've been training for my whole life.

302
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,780
Tianmen Bell.

303
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,980
Young man, you're quite knowledgeable.

304
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:07,580
Tell me first, what are you doing here?

305
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,680
I just want to go out for a walk.

306
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,680
I hope you'll allow me.

307
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:16,880
Little child, this is the forbidden area.

308
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,080
Just treat this place as the end of the world.

309
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,980
Go back.

310
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:26,880
Time is limited. I have no intention of bothering you.

311
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,680
I hope you can do me a favor.

312
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:32,380
The world is in chaos. There's no end to it.

313
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:36,080
We have been keeping our guard up.

314
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,380
Little child, you should just go back.

315
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,880
Go.

316
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,180
Young man, you've come a long way.

317
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:09,480
What is your true identity?

318
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,280
His true identity is our leader of the pervert group.

319
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,480
Our leader is called Ju Leng.

320
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,680
You've known him for some time.

321
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:44,180
Little child, where are you secretly going behind us?

322
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,180
Who are you?

323
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,180
Everyone,

324
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,580
introduce yourselves.

325
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,180
I'm the Three-Six God Lord.

326
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,580
I'm the second in the Masked Brigade.

327
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,580
I'm the Swordless Lord.

328
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,780
I'm the third in the Masked Brigade.

329
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,980
I'm the Child of the Thousand Chicken.

330
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,980
I'm the fourth in the Masked Brigade.

331
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,580
I'm the Fairy of the Miao Jade.

332
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,180
I'm the fifth in the Masked Brigade.

333
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:11,380
I'm the Sixth in the Masked Brigade.

334
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,980
I'm the Sixth in the Masked Brigade.

335
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:18,380
I'm the Seventh in the Masked Brigade.

336
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,580
You seem to have forgotten me.

337
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:26,580
I'm the Eighth in the Masked Brigade.

338
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,380
I'm Mr. Jian,

339
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,780
the Water of the Masked Brigade.

340
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,580
Please let us go,

341
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:39,780
and let us face the real world.

342
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,380
Ignorant and impulsive.

343
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:47,780
Do you know what's outside the Tianmen Pass?

344
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,580
The night is falling, the night is falling.

345
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,180
We already know that

346
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:55,780
there's a man who's been trying to

347
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,780
devour the darkness.

348
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,420
We're ready to

349
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,180
destroy it.

350
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,980
Young people don't know the world.

351
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,780
Go back now.

352
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:11,380
Then forget everything here.

353
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,980
The truth outside

354
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,980
is not something you can bear.

355
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,180
If that's the case,

356
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:19,980
then I'll be sorry.

357
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,380
You...

358
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,580
You dare to break the Tianmen Pass with one sword?

359
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:50,180
Which generation are you from?

360
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,780
I'm the Sixth in the Masked Brigade.

361
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,580
I'm the Eighth in the Masked Brigade.

362
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,380
I'm the Seventh in the Masked Brigade.

363
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:06,780
You...

364
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:11,180
You dare to break the Tianmen Pass with one sword?

365
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,380
You...

366
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:29,580
Senior, we've been in the way for years.

367
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,780
The purpose of the Eternal Night

368
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,380
is to protect the people here.

369
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:35,780
Young people,

370
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,580
listen to the old man.

371
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:42,380
You can't bear the consequences

372
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:46,180
of facing the dark.

373
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,780
Fate is fated.

374
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:53,180
We've seen the consequences.

375
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:54,980
What consequences?

376
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,180
Boss, come here.

377
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,180
We're out.

378
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,380
Brother, come here.

379
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:06,580
Goodbye.

380
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,580
Goodbye.

381
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:28,980
You're really here.

382
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,380
The red night is out.

383
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:32,980
Let's get started.

384
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,380
Let me ask you again.

385
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,180
Are you really going to do this?

386
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,780
What are the consequences?

387
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,780
Thank you for your concern.

388
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,780
I want to fight with the red night.

389
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:03,980
Here they come.

390
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,380
A group of fools.

391
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:09,180
I'll let you know

392
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:13,980
that fate can't be changed.

393
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:28,780
Senior.

394
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,980
I heard that Miss Leng is out of the Garden.

395
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,380
She won't be back for a while.

396
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:35,580
Yes.

397
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,580
Now,

398
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,980
only Miss Leng is in the Garden.

399
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,180
Good.

400
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,980
Everything is under control.

401
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,780
Take this.

402
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,980
Remember to add some

403
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,580
to Master's medicine every day.

404
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:55,980
Senior, this...

405
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,180
Don't worry.

406
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:02,380
I'll do what I promised you.

407
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,180
Yes.

408
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,180
Zi Zan, clear the path.

409
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,780
The red night is out.

410
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:08,980
Let me ask you again.

411
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,780
Are you really going to do this?

412
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,380
I'll let you know

413
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,180
that fate can't be changed.

414
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,780
I'll let you know

415
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,380
that fate can't be changed.

416
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,780
I'll let you know

417
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,580
that fate can't be changed.

418
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:21,980
I'll let you know

419
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,780
that fate can't be changed.

420
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,180
I'll let you know

421
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,980
that fate can't be changed.

422
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,380
I'll let you know

423
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,380
that fate can't be changed.

424
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:31,780
I'll let you know

425
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,780
that fate can't be changed.

426
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,380
I'll let you know

427
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:36,980
that fate can't be changed.

428
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,580
I'll let you know

429
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,580
that fate can't be changed.

430
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,780
Brother, is that the black love tree

431
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,380
that you've seen in your dream?

432
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,780
Yitan, follow me.

433
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,780
The others are on the alert.

434
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,180
Don't act on your own.

435
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,580
Hurry up.

436
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:48,380
There's a Angel is hiding one here.

437
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:38,620
Dad

438
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,560
Dad, It's late

439
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:53,660
Wu Er, Hongye

440
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,740
Allенного

441
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:58,380
I hope to

442
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,840
raise a fine

443
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:04,820
Chairwoman

444
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,820
Don't worry.

445
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:09,820
You are a man of the Wei State.

446
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:15,820
My brothers and I will definitely help you.

447
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:39,820
The Wei State is a great country.

448
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:42,820
It is a great country.

449
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:45,820
It is a great country.

450
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:48,820
It is a great country.

451
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:51,820
It is a great country.

452
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:54,820
It is a great country.

453
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:57,820
It is a great country.

454
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:00,820
It is a great country.

455
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:03,820
It is a great country.

456
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:07,820
It is a great country.

457
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:10,820
It is a great country.

458
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:13,820
It is a great country.

459
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:17,620
Wait excitingly for the fate of Leng Ning.

460
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:27,260
Yes, please!

461
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,140
Alas!

462
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,100
favorite one!

463
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,700
The amidst the red troops

464
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:40,260
is a daughter that you shouldn't pay attention to.

465
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:43,000
But she wasn't a father.

466
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,740
Put me down.

467
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,860
It's not close enough to screen them at the same time.

468
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,680
Won't thisever help?

469
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,100
I must destroy them all!

470
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:02,660
I'll do anything to protect them.

471
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:03,940
Put them in the cell!

472
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,260
Right this halfway!

473
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,940
Run, Zeng inflammation.

474
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,780
Hurry!

475
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:19,180
新友,

476
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,580
let's fight.

477
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,780
Go to the chaos, guard the spirit.

478
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,780
The evil spirit cannot control the human heart.

479
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:44,780
You must leave the formation.

480
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:47,780
Go to the chaos, guard the spirit.

481
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:58,680
The human heart is already a

482
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:15,080
記得我們為輔助

483
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,520
what Warlord needs best.

484
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,160
It was a Zhou's Heaven Effect,

485
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,980
but it feels like it's worth focus on.

486
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:23,800
Benny,

487
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,560
this effect is really scary.

488
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,580
Even if you don't kill him when you hibernate,

489
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,000
the attack constituents vibrate.

490
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,280
Chief Jing!

491
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,740
My sword�

492
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:48,040
You工作 provincial

493
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,760
I should learn

494
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,420
No

495
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,220
But it's not that

496
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,320
I'm not a teacher

497
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,240
Patience

498
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,220
Study

499
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,360
I'll go

500
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:12,960
You two

501
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,760
Just come closer

502
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:15,240
Yeah

503
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,240
Laugh

504
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,080
Swallow

505
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,160
How self- Laurent

506
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,040
Dare to take it to the fire

507
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,240
I'm afraid of you.

508
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:53,240
Let me think about how you're going to kill me.

509
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:18,240
I'm afraid of you.

510
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,240
What?

511
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:50,240
All the moves seem to have been seen through.

512
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,240
It's weird.

513
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:55,240
Wang Quan Hongye, do you think you should give up

514
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,240
if you have the will to come?

515
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,240
Joke.

516
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:21,240
Wang Quan Hongye, you dare to kill me?

517
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,240
Kill me?

518
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,240
You're desperate.

519
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:47,240
I can't kill you if you don't hate me.

520
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:50,240
Didn't I tell you?

521
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,240
Oh, right.

522
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,240
I must have killed you.

523
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,240
You don't have time to care about others.

524
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,240
You'd better worry about yourself.

525
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,240
Are you going to start?

526
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,240
When Hongye and Black Tiger are at war,

527
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,240
Black Tiger will surely use the power of the bitter-leaf tree.

528
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,240
The bitter-leaf tree will wither quickly.

529
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:39,240
We have to wait until then before we can start.

530
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:48,240
Hongye, are you all right?

531
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,240
Zhang Zheng!

532
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,240
Zhang Zheng!

533
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,240
Zhang Zheng!

534
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,240
Zhang Zheng!

535
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:24,240
Qingwu Yuan, give up struggling and join us.

536
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,240
Who wants to join you?

537
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,240
The heart is deep.

538
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:30,240
Who is the other end of the forbidden land?

539
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,240
Darkness is your eternal home.

540
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,240
Give up struggling, Qingwu Yuan.

541
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,240
Qingwu Yuan

542
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,240
How can I stop the wind?

543
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,240
How can I stop the clouds?

544
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:34,240
The sorrowful atmosphere is subdued.

545
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:39,240
Like a wind falling, like a flower falling.

546
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:45,240
You are in the distance.

547
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,240
The heart is not in the way.

548
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,240
The people have left their memories.

549
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:22,240
Look at the stars.

550
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:27,240
Love you as if we first met.

551
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:32,240
You are in my heart.

552
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,240
I want to exchange our life for a dream.

553
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:38,240
Even if we forget each other.

554
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,240
Look at the world.

555
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,240
I will take your beauty.

556
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:47,240
I want to see you for a thousand times.

557
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:56,240
UV

558
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:14,240
I took you many times.

559
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,240
I will return your favor in this life.

560
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:20,240
Even if we meet by chance,

561
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,240
I can't keep our past.

562
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,240
A dream is like a dream.

563
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:30,240
If we meet again in the next life.

564
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,240
I will return your favor in this life.

565
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:50,240
Even if we meet by chance,

566
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,240
I can't keep our past.

567
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:56,240
A dream is like a dream.

568
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,240
