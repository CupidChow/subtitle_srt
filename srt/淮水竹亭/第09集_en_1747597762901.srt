1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,700
destructive

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:01,760
our

3
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:02,360
new

4
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,180
TV show

5
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,020
We are

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,380
American

7
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,080
This is

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:22,960
turned

9
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,260
white

10
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,240
We organized

11
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,460
This church

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,160
Nacho

13
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:27,580
Tada

14
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,480
Mission

15
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:29,480
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

16
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,480
oh

17
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,480
Oh

18
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,480
Oh, you're back

19
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,480
What are you drawing?

20
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,480
You miss your brother-in-law

21
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,480
But did you ever think

22
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,480
What if this big brother

23
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,480
Looks more ugly than the mask

24
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,480
It shouldn't

25
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,480
Oh

26
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,480
Oh

27
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,480
What a woman

28
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,480
So fast

29
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,480
Turn your arms out

30
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,480
East Qin Lan

31
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,480
Sister, you hit me a few times

32
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,480
So maybe

33
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,480
You'll be a little happier

34
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,480
I haven't seen you smile for a long time

35
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,480
I know you're trying to make me happy

36
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,480
I'm fine

37
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,480
It's late

38
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,480
Go to sleep

39
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,480
But I just thought

40
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,480
Maybe the question I asked is not a problem at all

41
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,480
If he really looks ugly

42
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,480
You just let him wear a mask for the rest of his life

43
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,480
I'm going to sleep

44
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,480
Oh

45
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,480
I

46
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,480
I

47
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,480
I

48
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,480
I

49
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,480
Brother

50
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,480
What's up?

51
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,480
You're sending me a welcome message

52
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,480
It's too bad

53
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,480
Brother

54
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,740
growing in the robes on his chest.

55
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,580
So you prepared his soul another way?

56
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,580
Yes.

57
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,480
What's wrong with the demon?

58
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,480
He wants to kill, he wants to kill, he wants to kill.

59
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,480
The Eastern bad guys are waiting for me to become stronger.

60
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,480
The Fire and Fire Manor is mine.

61
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,480
Even you are mine.

62
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,480
You have no spirit blood, you lack talent.

63
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,480
You can only improve your skills with heavy skills.

64
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,480
You can't even beat me.

65
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,480
I'm not afraid of you.

66
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,480
You can only improve your skills with heavy skills.

67
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,480
You are nothing but a coward.

68
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,480
You are a little demon.

69
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,480
You dare to laugh at me?

70
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,480
You want to die.

71
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,480
As long as you forgive me,

72
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,480
I will have a way to make you stronger.

73
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,480
I'm sorry.

74
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,480
I'm late.

75
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,480
No, I'm early.

76
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,480
You...

77
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,480
You...

78
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,480
You...

79
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,480
You...

80
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,480
You...

81
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,480
You...

82
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,480
You...

83
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,480
You...

84
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,480
You...

85
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,480
You...

86
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,480
You are not happy.

87
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,480
Can you go somewhere with me?

88
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,480
Yan, I don't want to disturb you.

89
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,480
I'll give you some medicine and some pills.

90
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,480
You can have a baby tomorrow.

91
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,480
I'll give you all the necessary medicines.

92
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,480
I'll miss you,

93
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,480
I hope you'll be safe.

94
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,480
Zhu.

95
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,480
Zhu.

96
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,480
Zhu.

97
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,480
Why don't you see him?

98
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,480
He is my classmate.

99
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,480
We were separated from each other.

100
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,480
I was determined to do it.

101
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,480
I wanted to give up everything.

102
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,480
I respect his decision.

103
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,480
I owe him.

104
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,480
I don't want him to see me

105
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,480
and be sad about the past.

106
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,480
But it's not your fault.

107
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,480
I mean, maybe...

108
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,480
No matter what,

109
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,480
we can't live without him.

110
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,480
There are things that can't be changed.

111
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,480
Let's go drink.

112
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,480
This wine is good, right?

113
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,480
You drank most of it.

114
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,480
I'm sorry.

115
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,480
It's boring, right?

116
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,480
I let you drink with me,

117
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,480
but you didn't talk.

118
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,480
I'm here when you want to talk.

119
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,480
Have you ever tried to do everything

120
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,480
without any hesitation?

121
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,480
Of course.

122
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,480
What is it?

123
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,480
I saved a little boy before.

124
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,480
I promised him

125
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,480
to make him a wish on his birthday.

126
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,480
He asked me to take him to the sky.

127
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,480
But you know,

128
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,480
he can fly fast.

129
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,480
He didn't control himself.

130
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,480
He...

131
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,480
What happened to him?

132
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,480
He peed on me.

133
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,480
And then?

134
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,480
And then I went to the cloth store

135
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,480
to buy a new shirt.

136
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,480
The boss called me to the store.

137
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,480
He said it was normal.

138
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,480
I asked him what was normal.

139
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,480
He said I couldn't hold back

140
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,480
from flying.

141
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,480
I can't help it.

142
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,480
Here.

143
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,480
Thank you.

144
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,480
Thank you for being with me.

145
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,480
Actually, I've heard

146
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,480
about the Yang family.

147
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,480
Everything

148
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,480
should be saved.

149
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,480
But I don't think

150
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,480
it's safe to do so.

151
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,480
I'm afraid

152
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,480
that I'll be in danger.

153
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,480
The starting point is different.

154
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,480
The position is different.

155
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,480
You can't blame anyone.

156
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,480
Besides,

157
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,480
everyone has tried their best.

158
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,480
Even the saddest Yan

159
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,480
has started a new life.

160
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,480
And that day

161
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,480
I saw a snow.

162
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,480
It melted.

163
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,480
And it's spring.

164
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,480
The joy of life

165
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,480
is like a jade.

166
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,480
It's not easy.

167
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,480
Look.

168
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,480
It's done.

169
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,480
You gave me a golden basket.

170
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,480
I should have taken it.

171
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,480
Du Fanghuai Zhu,

172
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,480
I'm Wang Quan Hong Yin.

173
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,480
I'm not a man.

174
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,480
I'm a man.

175
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,480
I'm a man.

176
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,480
I'm a man.

177
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,480
I'm a man.

178
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,480
I'm a man.

179
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,480
I'm a man.

180
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,480
I'm a man.

181
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,480
I'm Wang Quan Hong Yin.

182
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,480
Wang Quan Hong Yin.

183
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,480
Why?

184
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,480
It's me.

185
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,480
In the Yang family,

186
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,480
we've said that we'll never see each other again.

187
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,480
I'm sorry.

188
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,480
Young master Wang Quan,

189
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,480
please leave me alone.

190
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,480
Huai Zhu.

191
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,480
On July 7,

192
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,480
the water will be clear.

193
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,480
We'll be together forever.

194
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,480
Huai Zhu,

195
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,480
let's go.

196
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,480
I'm sorry.

197
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,480
We'll see each other again.

198
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,480
Huai Zhu,

199
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,480
I'm sorry.

200
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,480
I'm sorry.

201
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,480
I'm sorry.

202
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,480
I'm sorry.

203
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,480
I'm sorry.

204
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,480
Yitan,

205
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,480
you haven't eaten for days.

206
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,480
I made your favorite small wonton for you.

207
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,480
Still angry with grandpa?

208
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,480
You can't eat this.

209
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,480
It will waste time.

210
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,480
You have a nickname outside.

211
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,480
Mr. Dong Li.

212
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,480
The fans I made

213
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,480
cost more than 100 taels.

214
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,480
Over the first half of this year,

215
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,480
our mountain villa has lost over 7000 taels.

216
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,480
I paid for it.

217
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,480
I made the small ones

218
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,480
and carved them out one by one.

219
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,480
Why did our mine fall down?

220
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,480
Why did Tianye family

221
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,480
lose to the other?

222
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,480
Do I need to tell you everything?

223
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,480
What do you mean?

224
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,480
You're angry with grandpa, right?

225
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,480
No.

226
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,480
I'm just carving the fans.

227
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,480
I'm thinking

228
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,480
if grandpa can sell the small one

229
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,480
because of the little power of the Nangong family,

230
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,480
how much profit can you make?

231
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,480
Yitan,

232
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,480
you have parents and two sons.

233
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,480
I raised you up.

234
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,480
I love you and love you for this?

235
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,480
Love me?

236
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,480
Love me?

237
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,480
You...

238
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,480
How much profit can you make

239
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,480
if you cut your own palm

240
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,480
without being seduced by the superstition?

241
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,480
I want to try, too.

242
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,480
No.

243
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,480
No.

244
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,480
Yitan,

245
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,480
you should never get hurt

246
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,480
from the sin of bloodshed since childhood.

247
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,840
I can't rest in peace.

248
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,480
Then please,

249
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,520
love my grandfather.

250
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,000
How did you

251
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,200
open my eyes?

252
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,400
I...

253
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,080
I remember that winter,

254
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,760
when you threw me into the hole,

255
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,000
I was only 12 years old.

256
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,920
You even gave the

257
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,640
Yitan the cold medicine,

258
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,720
and put it deep in the mine.

259
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,080
No, I have to go and have a look.

260
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,600
Father,

261
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,240
if the people of the Yang family are over 12 years old,

262
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,880
they will never be able to open their eyes again.

263
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,400
Yitan is the most talented person in our family.

264
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,240
If you don't be cruel at this critical moment,

265
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,480
the people of our family will be doomed.

266
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,880
You...

267
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,720
I hope that Heaven can protect our family.

268
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,320
Where am I?

269
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,720
Where am I?

270
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,880
God...

271
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,680
Yitan.

272
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,600
Yitan!

273
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,440
Yitan, where are you?

274
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,440
It's Ah Zui's voice.

275
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,440
Ah Zui!

276
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,240
Ah Zui, where are you?

277
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,240
Yitan, I'm here!

278
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,440
Yitan, I came to your house to find you.

279
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,240
I heard you were thrown into the hole by grandpa.

280
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,840
So I came here.

281
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,240
It's too dangerous.

282
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,440
Go away!

283
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,040
If you don't come out, I won't go.

284
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,840
At worst, we'll be done together.

285
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,640
How can you explain to our family

286
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,640
to that cruel grandpa?

287
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,640
Ah Zui, don't talk nonsense.

288
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,240
The hole will collapse again at any time.

289
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,640
No, it's dangerous for Ah Zui.

290
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,840
I must find a way.

291
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,240
I must!

292
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,240
No!

293
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,440
No!

294
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,240
Ah Zui, get away!

295
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,440
Get away!

296
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,640
When I was twelve,

297
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,440
I almost died.

298
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,440
It doesn't matter if I die.

299
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,040
I almost lost Ah Zui.

300
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,440
Luckily, you're both fine.

301
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,640
Yes.

302
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,440
Luckily, we're both fine.

303
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,040
Luckily, I opened my eyes.

304
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,040
Luckily,

305
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,840
I was only unconscious for a month after I came back.

306
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,040
We're all helping you.

307
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,440
What a help!

308
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,240
What help?

309
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,640
You're helping the family to survive

310
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,040
or to feed your family?

311
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,040
Yitan, I'm your grandpa.

312
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,240
How can you say such a cruel thing?

313
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,440
If you weren't my grandpa,

314
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,840
I would stay here.

315
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,440
Now my aunt is gone.

316
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,640
The only light in the family's life

317
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,040
is gone.

318
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,440
I'm not happy.

319
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,440
I don't want to pretend anymore.

320
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,440
Yitan,

321
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,840
grandpa is old.

322
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,840
You can't treat an old man like that.

323
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,440
I'm still in the Yang family.

324
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,240
I remember the last respect.

325
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,040
It's already the last chance

326
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,840
for me to give you.

327
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,440
It's the last chance

328
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,040
for me to give you.

329
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,840
Master,

330
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,040
it's late.

331
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,240
I'll go now.

332
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,240
YQu got me.

333
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,840
It's지만 я這邊 просто incomplete.

334
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,640
",

335
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:39,480
Вы mash 금그 из 예�

336
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,040
realized I wasn't like youitatved.

337
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,840
That's why I was alive.

338
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,840
I can give you the last chance to be my wife.

339
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,840
Did I do something wrong?

340
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,840
Did I do something wrong?

341
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,840
For the sake of the Yang family,

342
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,840
for the sake of the family,

343
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,840
for the sake of the family,

344
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,840
what did I do wrong?

345
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:26,840
Why do you treat me like this?

346
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,840
Why do you all leave me?

347
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,840
Yang Huanzhou

348
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,840
Yang Huanzhou

349
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,840
Nangongye is useless.

350
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,840
Will you be better than him?

351
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,840
Who are you?

352
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,840
I am you.

353
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,840
The injustice, hatred and hatred in your heart

354
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,840
will become me.

355
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,840
Who are you?

356
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,840
Who are you?

357
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,840
Have you heard the prophecy of the night

358
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,840
when the candle of love will be extinguished and the night will come?

359
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,840
I am the one who is destined to rule

360
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,840
the whole world.

361
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,840
The eternal night.

362
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,840
That's impossible.

363
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,840
You just said

364
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,840
you are still outside the world.

365
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,840
Yes.

366
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,840
I am still outside the world.

367
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,840
I can't enter.

368
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,840
But I can feel your hatred.

369
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:46,840
Since this hatred is in contact with you,

370
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,840
I chose you.

371
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,840
It's your great fortune.

372
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,840
No!

373
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,840
I am a righteous sect.

374
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,840
How can I be a king of a evil thing?

375
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,840
What a coincidence.

376
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,840
Nangongye said the same thing.

377
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,840
The Nangong family and the Yang family were also in the country.

378
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:14,840
Nangongye couldn't even take the crown and the crown.

379
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,840
So you taught Nangongye

380
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,840
the swordplay of the demon elixir.

381
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,840
Smart.

382
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,840
What can you give me?

383
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,840
I need to have the power.

384
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,840
I need this power

385
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,840
to fight against Wangquan Hongye.

386
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,840
You should have sent someone to inform the Demon Kingdom.

387
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,840
I should have followed the etiquette and welcomed you.

388
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:02,840
The Demon Kingdom and the Yiqi Alliance have always been close.

389
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,840
Your kingdom has the Demon Kingdom and the Yiqi Alliance.

390
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,840
I have no right to control them.

391
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:10,840
But I hope the Demon Kingdom can only be used in the Demon Kingdom.

392
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,840
It can't be used in the Yiqi Alliance.

393
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,840
Young master, I don't know what you are talking about.

394
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,840
Okay.

395
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,840
I remember the golden cloud

396
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:34,840
was used by the king of the Demon Kingdom.

397
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,840
I remember it right.

398
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,840
Then please

399
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,840
take care of the Demon Kingdom.

400
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,840
I will.

401
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,840
The king of the Demon Kingdom

402
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,840
will no longer sell the Demon's Tally.

403
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,840
You will be responsible for the registration and sale.

404
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,840
Yes.

405
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,840
Liu Yunxuan said

406
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,840
that a Demon King's Tally was sold recently.

407
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:28,840
He found out that the person went to the Palace of the Demon Kingdom.

408
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,840
I will go back first.

409
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,840
I will investigate it myself.

410
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,840
I will go to the Palace of the Demon Kingdom.

411
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,840
After the king of the Demon Kingdom entered the palace,

412
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,840
he went to Liu Yunxuan directly.

413
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,840
He used only one sword to cut the right arm of the master.

414
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,840
It was Liu Yunxuan's sword.

415
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,840
It means that if we don't obey,

416
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,840
we will wait for the cloud to cover the coffin.

417
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,840
Liu Yunxuan's master?

418
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,840
He is the best master of the Demon Kingdom.

419
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,840
Are you sure that he only used one sword?

420
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,840
Liu Yunxuan's people and demons can be seen.

421
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,840
Whether you want or not,

422
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,840
the matter of the Demon Tally infiltrating the Yiqi Alliance

423
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,840
seems to be delayed for now.

424
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,840
I have given you the power you want.

425
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,840
You have to do something for me.

426
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,840
Use my method to save a demon.

427
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,840
You have the Demon of Heaven.

428
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,840
Will you help us?

429
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,840
I must use the Demon Tally

430
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,840
to become the master of the Demon of Heaven.

431
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,840
Let it be used by me.

432
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,840
I will help you.

433
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,840
I will help you.

434
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,840
I will help you.

435
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,840
I will help you.

436
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,840
I will help you.

437
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,840
I will help you.

438
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,840
I will help you.

439
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,840
How should this Demon be used

440
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,840
to strengthen the seal?

441
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,840
Very good.

442
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,840
From now on,

443
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,840
you are my slave.

444
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,840
You're here at the right time.

445
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,840
Wang Quan Hongye, we're meant to meet.

446
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,840
You know me?

447
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:10,840
I was just a mule under your feet.

448
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:14,840
But today, I'm here with you.

449
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,840
I'm here to save you.

450
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,840
I'm here to save you.

451
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,840
I was just a mule under your feet.

452
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,840
But today, I'm here to show you my power.

453
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,840
From now on, you're a slave to my evil thoughts.

454
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,840
I'm your slave.

455
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,840
Go, pull out the dragon bone behind me.

456
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,840
Pull it out.

457
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,840
I'm not a slave.

458
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,840
I'm a slave.

459
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,840
I'm a slave.

460
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,840
Pull it out.

461
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,840
Pull it out.

462
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,840
Pull it out.

463
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,840
Still fighting?

464
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,840
I'll help you.

465
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:48,840
The power of the witch has been absorbed into her body.

466
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,840
Why don't you go?

467
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,840
I'm afraid of her.

468
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,840
Go, pull out her body.

469
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:41,840
You can kill and kill, but you should never be a slave.

470
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,840
You...

471
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:48,840
You'll be punished for your fight against the evil.

472
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,840
You'll be punished for your fight against the evil.

473
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:15,840
You can kill and kill, but you should never be a slave.

474
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:24,840
You can kill and kill, but you should never be a slave.

475
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,840
Forgive me.

476
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,840
You're a mule.

477
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,840
How dare you do this to me?

478
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,840
Who sent you here?

479
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,840
I'm a slave.

480
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,840
How dare you do this to me?

481
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,840
You're a mule.

482
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,840
How dare you do this to me?

483
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,840
What a pity.

484
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,840
You're a mule.

485
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,840
How dare you do this to me?

486
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,840
You're a mule.

487
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,840
You're a mule.

488
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:18,240
The real Jialan was sealed outside the ring.

489
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:26,040
Jialan, you've become like this.

490
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,040
Lord Jiuhuo, Jialan was killed by the evil.

491
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,440
He has no body.

492
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,640
Lord Jiuhuo, break the ring.

493
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,440
Jialan has been waiting for you for 500 years in the darkness and loneliness.

494
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,640
Don't worry.

495
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:47,040
I'll get back what you lost.

496
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:52,240
You want to live forever, then you'll live forever.

497
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,840
Go to the Deep Fire Manor and find him.

498
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:01,640
I lost my body, but he will be my perfect container.

499
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,440
He?

500
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:07,640
You'll understand everything when you see him.

501
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:13,640
Lord Jiuhuo, I can use this fool.

502
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,240
Please let him understand.

503
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,640
The cold tears fall as I wake up.

504
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:50,640
The wind blows, the rain falls, the sun and the moon fall.

505
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:56,640
The light of the night shines on the city.

506
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:02,640
But how can I ask to admit my heart?

507
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:08,640
I admit that I'm not worthy of being with you.

508
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:12,640
The night is getting warmer, the year is getting colder.

509
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,640
The moon is getting closer to the left.

510
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:21,640
I'm going to make the one who died a lucky person.

511
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,640
I don't care about the life we've been together for.

512
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,640
I don't care about the eternity that the soul has decided.

513
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,640
The truth is that love is like sugar, falling slowly.

514
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,640
How can it be so sad?

515
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,640
I don't care about the life we've been together for.

516
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:41,640
I don't care about the yearning that is burning.

517
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:47,640
Maybe we've missed each other.

518
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:03,640
The night is getting warmer, the year is getting colder.

519
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:07,640
The moon is getting closer to the left.

520
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:12,640
I'm going to make the one who died a lucky person.

521
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,640
I'm going to make the one who died a lucky person.

522
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,640
I don't care about the life we've been together for.

523
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:23,640
I don't care about the eternity that the soul has decided.

524
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:30,640
Maybe we've missed each other.
