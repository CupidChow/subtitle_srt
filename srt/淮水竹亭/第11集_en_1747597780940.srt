00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Episode 14

9
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Brother, how are you?

10
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm much better now.

11
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Why did Sister Huai Zhu become like this?

12
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
They said that Master Cheng...

13
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
is the monster who took away Sister Huai Zhu's life.

14
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Why did he bring Sister Huai Zhu here?

15
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I want to know what you said.

16
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So when I fought with her,

17
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I left a Qiting Talisman on her.

18
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
When they met,

19
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
the one they liked became a monster.

20
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
With this kind of emotional stimulation,

21
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
they could leave a Qiting Talisman?

22
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Master.

23
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Leave.

24
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm tired.

25
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
What did Lord Jiuhuo hide from me?

26
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You are Dongfang Huai Zhu, not some kind of guardian.

27
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
If you don't remember,

28
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I will help you remember.

29
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Who is Dongfang Huai Zhu he mentioned?

30
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Lord Jiuhuo.

31
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You are more ambiguous than before.

32
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I didn't expect that

33
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Lord Jiuhuo would comb hair for people.

34
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
When you were young,

35
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
you were more strict.

36
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Every time I combed your hair,

37
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
you would mess up.

38
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
At that time,

39
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I really wanted to give you a good chance.

40
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I really wanted to give you a good chance.

42
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Did Lord Jiuhuo really mean me?

43
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You don't have to doubt.

44
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
That Mantua Flower is the best proof.

45
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Today...

46
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Today you didn't come to my room.

47
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And nothing happened.

48
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You just need to remember.

49
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I raised you up since you were young.

50
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
If I didn't protect you,

51
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
both the human and the demon would have no place for you.

52
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
But why I can't remember all these?

53
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You were seriously injured in the battle with the human race.

54
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You lost your memory.

55
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
What?

56
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You doubt me?

57
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I don't dare.

58
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Did something happen when you left the city today?

59
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I...

60
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I met a crazy man who called himself Wang Quan Hongye.

61
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
He said he knew me.

62
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
He also said my name was Dongfang Huai Zhu.

63
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
The mountain village of Wang Quan has long been destroyed.

64
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
There is no such person.

65
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
He is a liar.

66
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You don't have to doubt.

67
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Yes, Lord.

68
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I have a task for you.

69
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Recently, in the northwest of Li Zi Po,

70
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
there is a very powerful demon.

71
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I hope you can catch him for me.

72
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
When should I start?

73
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Let's set off early tomorrow.

74
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Yes.

75
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Yes.

76
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
This wine store is losing its owner.

77
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
The point is not to leave tomorrow.

78
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
He has a task and the wine store can't appear.

79
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
He lost his owner.

80
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
They are so close.

81
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's only a few days.

82
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Brother said that although we are only a few hours late,

83
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
we should have been here for a while.

84
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
But hearing the tone,

85
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
it doesn't seem to be a relationship that can be cultivated in two or three days.

86
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Right?

87
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm sorry.

88
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
There is a very important sentence in the wine store.

89
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
The mountain village of Wang Quan has long been destroyed.

90
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Huai Zhu also said that.

91
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
How can it be destroyed?

92
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Will it be like the mountain village of Shen Huo and Ruyi House?

93
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
How are we?

94
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Where is the mask group?

95
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Brother, I want to go home and see.

96
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
The time is urgent.

97
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Our first task is to bring Dongfang Huai Zhu back.

98
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I will think of a way

99
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
to contact the mask group and everyone in the mountain village of Wang Quan.

100
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Let's go.

101
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
A Sui.

102
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,280
What do I bait that girl up to?

103
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,960
Green plum wine...

104
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,480
Heavy style wine.

105
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,100
Not bad.

106
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,820
You even know there's a mission.

107
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,960
Of course.

108
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,200
How is Yi Lang?

109
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,500
He's busy with the news about the cruise ship.

110
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:41,800
..

111
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:56,000
The

112
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Since childhood, my mother left early.

113
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
My father's whereabouts are unknown.

114
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You never asked me.

115
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
When facing rumors, you didn't mention it.

116
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I know you care about me.

117
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You think I'm a brother.

118
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I've already been through so much.

119
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:29,000
So if there's a top ranking in this world,

120
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
then A'Zui will definitely be the best.

121
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Brother, I'm really scared.

122
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I've already lost my parents.

123
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm afraid of losing you, my uncle, and anyone in the crew.

124
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

125
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'll protect everyone.

126
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'll find my father.

127
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I won't let A'Zui lose anyone.

128
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
We meet again, the same night as the last day.

129
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Where is this place?

130
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
What is your purpose?

131
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I told you, I'm Yongye.

132
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:28,000
The flower line of Mantuo is the time when the Eastern Pearl disappeared.

133
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Brother, did you have that dream again?

134
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Yes. I dreamed that tree was getting bigger.

135
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
If according to your speculation, this tree is a hate tree,

136
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
then it should be getting bigger.

137
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Because the fight between humans and demons has reached a terrible level.

138
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
What about you? Have you finished arranging?

139
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I've released the news. I've just searched nearby.

140
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
This was originally the capital of the Huangquan clan.

141
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
The city's owner is the demon king Ye Yuan of the Huangquan clan.

142
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
About four months ago, a demon came to the city.

143
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
He quickly became the new city's owner.

144
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
That should be Jiuhuo.

145
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
From that time, Bi Luo City began to accept humans and demons and protect them.

146
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
The small town outside the city slowly began to grow.

147
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,620
But why did Jiuhuo bring the

148
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,000
Pillar back to 20 years later?

149
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
What is her purpose?

150
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
This is not known yet.

151
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I am Yongye.

152
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I always feel that she came for this.

153
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
She came for this.

154
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Anyway, let's solve Li Zipo's problem first.

155
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Okay.

156
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
They're here. Including Miss Dongfang.

157
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Seven of them.

158
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Let's go.

159
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Attack your master.

160
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:25,080
The Demon King's

161
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
What do you want from me?

162
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Why are you so entangled?

163
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
How could a mere T-shirt not be discovered?

164
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
It's obvious that it's a trap.

165
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Then how can your master Jiuhuo confirm that

166
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
we who fell into the trap will be subdued?

167
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Then there is only one possibility.

168
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:56,000
She gave you a magic weapon that can kill enemies in one move.

169
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
A man with many hearts and white hair.

170
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You're so kind.

171
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Be careful of the young man's white hair.

172
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Let's see what it is.

173
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
This is a transmission device.

174
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
The location seems to be designed by Jingjing.

175
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You can't afford to disturb Jiuhuo.

176
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Let me go.

177
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
There is still a way to survive.

178
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Not only that.

179
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Your master Jiuhuo should be watching the scene.

180
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I have something to give her.

181
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I will definitely bring Huaizhu back.

182
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
No matter what you are planning, you will not find it.

183
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Interesting.

184
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I'll be right back.

185
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
This young man.

186
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Is the girl in your mouth very similar to me?

187
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
She has hurt your heart.

188
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
What do you think?

189
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Even so, you shouldn't be obsessed with me who looks like her.

190
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Listen to me.

191
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It's unnecessary to turn back and fight.

192
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Brother.

193
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I know.

194
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
That's not what I want.

195
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Huaizhu really doesn't remember us at all.

196
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I may not be able to remember here.

197
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
It's not necessarily that I will go back to Shenhuoshan Village.

198
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Let's start.

199
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,200
Wang Quan Hong Ye, I admit that you're very smart.

200
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,200
But do you know that in the face of absolute power,

201
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,200
all your plans will be wasted?

202
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,400
I don't like to kill people myself.

203
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,200
But today, I'll break your power once.

204
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,400
Det Qian Yan head to Längs crown and battery.

205
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,900
Which one is stronger?

206
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,400
T scient Marian, let me tell you.

207
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,200
Why are Rui Viet so smart?

208
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,300
twin chow pei

209
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,300
The Great Wall of China

210
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,300
Don't worry.

211
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,300
Big Brother has always been very careful.

212
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,300
He asked us to leave first.

213
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,300
He must have his backup.

214
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,300
Since we can't go back,

215
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,300
let's just sneak into the Bilo City

216
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,300
and figure out what the Jiuhuo wants to do.

217
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,300
Okay.

218
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,300
The barrier?

219
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,300
Jiuhuo sent me here

220
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,300
to put me in a dead end.

221
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,300
We're trapped here. No one can get out.

222
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,300
Since we can't get out,

223
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,300
why don't we

224
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,300
think of a way together?

225
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,300
Let's go.

226
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,300
The Wall of China

227
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,300
Tell me.

228
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,300
Where is the room

229
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,300
of your Lord Jiuhuo?

230
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,300
There's a smell of blood.

231
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,300
The fan...

232
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,300
The monsters in the Hall

233
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,300
are veryав

234
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,300
.

235
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,300
But I've still seen nothing.

236
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:23,900
If you can't see the needle, it should be there.

237
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,300
There's no mechanism or needle in this room.

238
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:50,100
I heard that the protection spell has fallen into the barrier of the Sky Mountain.

239
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,900
Are you happy?

240
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,900
I dare not.

241
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,900
The barrier of the Sky Mountain has always been interesting and never-ending.

242
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,900
You have to find a way quickly.

243
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:04,500
The person I choose will not be so reckless.

244
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,500
The repair is behind schedule.

245
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:15,500
Within ten days, we must collect a thousand pieces of gold dust.

246
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,900
Please rest assured, Your Excellency.

247
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,300
It's not too late.

248
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:23,100
The Four Fish Emperors have completed the final batch of broken pieces of gold dust.

249
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,900
They will be delivered in two days.

250
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,100
Your Excellency.

251
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,900
Are the food ready?

252
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:35,900
I'll be right there.

253
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,100
I'll deliver it to you.

254
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:38,900
Leave now.

255
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,500
I want to stay here alone for a while.

256
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:42,900
Yes.

257
00:23:48,300 --> 00:24:00,900
The secret treasure and magic of the Demon Lord Yan

258
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,900
are truly amazing.

259
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,900
The list of the famous demons in the city.

260
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,300
Brother Yi, look at this.

261
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,700
It might be a clue.

262
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:42,900
Brother Yi, the Qin thief has come.

263
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:46,300
Why don't we ambush him and meet the monster?

264
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,500
We have seen the Echo of the Fox's force.

265
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:53,300
Even if we attack him secretly, we probably won't win.

266
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,000
It's nothing.

267
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Something happened.

268
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,680
A water demon escaped from the bottom of the sea.

269
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,000
How could there be such a big mistake?

270
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,600
Inform Li Ge to search the whole city for the water demon.

271
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,200
There's not much time left.

272
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,920
Even if we only have one piece of it,

273
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,280
Jinchen Department can't repair it.

274
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,600
Hurry up and find it.

275
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,120
Yes, sir.

276
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,280
I'll go immediately.

277
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,200
Wait.

278
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,000
Where's the food you want?

279
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,360
I think it should be delivered soon.

280
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,360
Can't you do such a small thing?

281
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,120
Are you angry?

282
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,160
You want my life, not yours?

283
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,040
I dare not.

284
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,400
I'll go with you immediately.

285
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,760
Forget it.

286
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,080
I'll go find it myself.

287
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,760
What's the secret of this Biro City?

288
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,040
Let's go find the water demon first.

289
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,680
Here it is.

290
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,680
Don't move.

291
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,640
Go.

292
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,680
I guess it's you.

293
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,240
Pass.

294
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:18,640
Our two books have changed notes notes've changed,

295
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,640
Left shoulder, right shoulder, left shoulder, right shoulder, right shoulder, right shoulder

296
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,340
Interesting

297
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,940
I have a mission tonight

298
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,940
You die for me

299
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,140
I will remember your faces

300
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:38,840
Yitang

301
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:39,440
Retreat

302
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:41,940
Can you?

303
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,020
Get ready

304
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:50,640
Go

305
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:26,260
events have been

306
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:35,100
this time

307
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:41,760
actually

308
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,760
Interesting.

309
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:49,760
You people are getting more and more interesting.

310
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,760
This flower is exactly the same as the one you have.

311
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,760
What flower is this?

312
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,760
Man Tuo Flower.

313
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,760
Man Tuo Flower?

314
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:11,760
Man Tuo Flower is the time when the Eastern Huai Zhuo disappeared.

315
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,760
Is it really me that you are talking about?

316
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,760
You don't need to doubt.

317
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,760
That Man Tuo Flower is the best evidence.

318
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:27,760
This mark seems to have a special meaning to Jiuhuo.

319
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,760
This mark was drawn by Jiuhuo personally.

320
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,760
It's natural.

321
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,760
If you don't believe me, take a look.

322
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,760
I'm sorry to disturb your fun.

323
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,760
Let me introduce myself.

324
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,760
I am the owner of this Xuan Kong Mountain enchantment, Hu Yao Jialan.

325
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,760
I'm Hu Yao Jialan.

326
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,760
You two look like you are having a good time.

327
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,760
Jialan, I'm feeling better.

328
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,760
You are Hu Yao, but you are from Mount Tushan.

329
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,760
Why are you here?

330
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,760
I'm the disciple of Lord Jiuhuo.

331
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,760
Your Lord Jiuhuo often sends people here to play with you.

332
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,760
Where are those people?

333
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,760
You guys are really a lot of questions.

334
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,760
Let me tell you a secret.

335
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:31,760
After three hours, this Xuan Kong Mountain will be full of poisonous things.

336
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,760
Even a mosquito can't escape.

337
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,760
Look, I even told you this.

338
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,760
Isn't it very nice?

339
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,760
It's cute.

340
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:43,760
So they were all poisoned to death.

341
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,760
Brother, you are talking like this, but it's not interesting.

342
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,760
They don't play well.

343
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,760
Of course they have to die.

344
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,760
Then how can we say that they played well?

345
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,760
If they beat me, it means they played well.

346
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,760
If they beat you, we can go out.

347
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,760
Okay, you two can try.

348
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,760
Lord, do you want to bring him out?

349
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,760
Don't you hate him?

350
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,760
Why do you start to care about his life?

351
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,760
I don't dare.

352
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:23,760
I know you must have a lot of doubts.

353
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,760
Who is he?

354
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,760
Why do I have to start a magic formation and bring him back 20 years later?

355
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:35,760
I can only tell you that there is a person who is very important to me.

356
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,760
He was sealed in the two realms of the gods and demons.

357
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,760
I want to save him.

358
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,760
I have to do two things.

359
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:48,760
Repair Jin Chenxi and my demon power can break the barrier and bring him back.

360
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,760
What about the second thing?

361
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,760
Is it related to the Left Guardian?

362
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:58,760
The Left Guardian is the necessary condition to bring him back to me.

363
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:02,760
I have been observing the stars and the sky for a year.

364
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,760
The seven-star lotus has lasted for a month.

365
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:10,760
In this month, the power of sealing the barrier will be weak.

366
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:15,760
So I started a magic formation and brought him back 20 years ago.

367
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,760
The Left Guardian has opened its mantou flower.

368
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:23,760
He will never fall into the black and empty mountains.

369
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,760
The red night of the dead spring.

370
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:32,760
You risked your life to chase it, but you died in the hands of your beloved.

371
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:36,760
This feeling must be very beautiful.

372
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:40,760
Mr. Yin's son, Guoqian, is my brother.

373
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,760
My brother said that you did not know anything in the past.

374
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,760
Why are you here?

375
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:52,080
I came as soon as the

376
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,760
gathered the leave and took over the temple to bury your brother.

377
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,760
Guoqian, let's go together.

378
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,760
Please wait a little longer.

379
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,040
Did you use the heaven eye and the stomach?

380
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,120
I think so.

381
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,200
But Xiaomei, I'm a little hungry.

382
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,680
Can you get me something to eat?

383
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,240
Okay.

384
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,760
A bottle of yogurt...

385
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,680
A bottle of yogurt...

386
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:48,520
Because my mother is always

387
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:48,840
beiden

388
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,760
You see too hard

389
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,560
You see too hard

390
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,200
call

391
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:51,840
to

392
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:52,680
Thomas

393
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,320
Spanish

394
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,200
requires

395
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:56,780
Call

396
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,760
a

397
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:58,920
bottle of yogurt

398
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,680
I else

399
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,080
is

400
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:03,520
good

401
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,160
OK

402
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,160
You're hurt and you're hiding it from me.

403
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,160
I'm fine.

404
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,160
It's just a scratch.

405
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,160
The wound is only on the nail.

406
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,160
Really?

407
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,160
Really.

408
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,160
If you don't believe me, look.

409
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,160
Let me see.

410
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,160
Let me do it.

411
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,160
Okay.

412
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,160
Then, hold it tight.

413
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,160
It's not a big deal.

414
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,160
Be careful.

415
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,160
Okay.

416
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,160
Does it hurt?

417
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,160
It's okay.

418
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,160
What's wrong?

419
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,160
Oh.

420
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,160
You touched my nose with your hair.

421
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,160
It's itchy.

422
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,160
You don't look well.

423
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,160
Is there anything else that's uncomfortable?

424
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,160
I'm just a little dizzy.

425
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,160
Don't move.

426
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,160
It's a little hot.

427
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,160
I'm just a little tired.

428
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,160
I'll just sleep for a while.

429
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,160
Yutang.

430
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,160
Yutang.

431
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,160
Since you want to bet,

432
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,160
there must be a bet.

433
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,160
I'll be the bet.

434
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,160
Every time I win,

435
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:53,160
you have to take off the same thing on the other person.

436
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,160
The person who takes off the light

437
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,160
will be the winner.

438
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,160
Okay.

439
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,160
Okay.

440
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,160
Okay.

441
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,160
Okay.

442
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,160
I'm telling you.

443
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,160
How can we win?

444
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:08,160
I'll win if I win once.

445
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,160
Am I kind?

446
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,160
Let's start.

447
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,160
This one,

448
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:26,160
let's compare whose points are smaller.

449
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,160
Open.

450
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,160
Open.

451
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,160
You lost.

452
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,160
This is unfair.

453
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,160
You're being fair to the banker.

454
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,160
I'm willing to lose.

455
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,160
Take off the thing.

456
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,160
Let's continue.

457
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,160
Sister, it's your turn.

458
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,160
What are we betting on this time?

459
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,160
I bet on my tongue.

460
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,160
Can you lick my nose?

461
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,160
I'm not fooled.

462
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,160
You're a fox.

463
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,160
I said no.

464
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,160
You must fill it up for me immediately.

465
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,160
I want to say yes.

466
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,160
You have a good sense of humor.

467
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,160
I'm not a fox.

468
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,160
I'm a fox.

469
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,160
I'm a fox.

470
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,160
I'm a fox.

471
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,160
I'm a fox.

472
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,160
I'm a fox.

473
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,160
I'm a fox.

474
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,160
I'm a fox.

475
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,160
I'm a fox.

476
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,160
I'm a fox.

477
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,160
Maybe you'll play a trick on me again.

478
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,160
I admit defeat.

479
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,160
People often say that the one who falls in love first will definitely lose.

480
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,160
This brother is hopeless.

481
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,160
I'm sorry.

482
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,160
I'm sorry.

483
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,160
I'm sorry.

484
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,160
I'm sorry.

485
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,160
I'm sorry.

486
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,160
I'm sorry.

487
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,160
I'm sorry.

488
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,160
I'm sorry.

489
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,160
I'm sorry.

490
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,160
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

494
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,160
I'm sorry.

495
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,160
I'm sorry.

496
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,160
I'm sorry.

497
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,160
I'm sorry.

498
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,160
I'm sorry.

499
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,160
I'm sorry.

500
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,160
I'm sorry.

501
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,160
I'm sorry.

502
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,160
I'm sorry.

503
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,160
I'm sorry.

504
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,160
I'm sorry.

505

I'm sorry.

506

I'm sorry.

507
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,160
I'm sorry.

508
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,160
I'm sorry.

509
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,160
I'm sorry.

510
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,160
I'm sorry.

511
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,160
I'm sorry.

512
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,160
I'm sorry.

513
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,160
I'm sorry.

514
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,160
I'm sorry.

515
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,160
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

522

I'm sorry.

523
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,160
I'm sorry.

524
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,160
I'm sorry.

525
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,160
I'm sorry.

526
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,160
I'm sorry.

527
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,160
