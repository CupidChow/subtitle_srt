Please come in

29
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Young Master Yang, the Yang family is now in a bad situation

30
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But you are the son-in-law of Wang Quan's family

31
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's so cool under this tree

32
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Nangongchui, what do you want to do?

33
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000

Dongfang Huai's mother

00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Why is she here?

41
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It seems that Nangongye's chess has a good chance

42
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Young Master Yang

43
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Miss Dongfang, the one sitting on my right is Young Master Wang Quan

44
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Please be careful with your sword

46
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
My dear masters, Nangongye is so lucky

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
to fight with you

48
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Nangongye is sure to be the winner

50
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Once the sword is out, it will turn the long-term crisis of the human-demon war

51
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Come, let's join the alliance of the same spirit and the same spirit

52
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Let's join the alliance of the same spirit and the same spirit

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Before the heavenly demon sword is out of the furnace

54
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I have prepared appetizing dishes for you

55
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000

A thousand years of cultivation

58
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
This's the name of a black jade

59
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's the water of the world

60
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
the에요 of dezwhis

61
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
800 years of cultivation

62
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,840
With the help of the demon elixir,

63
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,360
the poison will be rejuvenated.

64
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,840

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,840

I will seal the kingdom

68
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
and cut through the walls.

69
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Please, Master Nangong, please try the elixir.

70
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You don't have to be angry, Master.

71
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm willing to give you these four swords.

72
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Master Nangong is so kind.

73
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I, Cheng, want one.

74
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I also want one.

75
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
If the Han family wants it,

76
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I, Zhou family also want it.

77
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Young Master Wang Quan,

78
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
are you interested in

79
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
getting a sword made of demon elixir?

80
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Master Nangong, you're too kind.

81
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I can hold Wang Quan.

82
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
That's enough.

83
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Master Nangong, please try the elixir.

84
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000

DoctorWHOSx

135

DoctorWHOSx

136
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
DoctorWHOSx

137
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
DoctorWHOSx

138
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
DoctorWHOSx

139
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Master Nangong,

140
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
the moon and the moon are two different colors.

141
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
What are you looking at?

142
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
A'Zhu,

143
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
you should pack up your things

144
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
and then go to the villa

145
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
to serve Young Master Wang Quan.

146
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
You must do your best.

147
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'm going.

148
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Did he get hit?

149
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Why can't I see it?

150
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
This is the plan set by Master Nangong.

151
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
In your opinion,

152
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
did Wang Quan Hongye get hurt?

153
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I think Young Master Wang Quan is calm.

154
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It's better to check it out.

155
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
That's good.

156
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
When you get to his side,

157
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
pay attention.

158
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
When the ceremony starts tomorrow,

159
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
we will do our best to complete the big event.

160
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,880
The

161
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Nangong has been hit.

162
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
There must be a sound.

163
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Young Master Wang Quan,

164
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Master Nangong has been ordered to serve you.

165
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Come in.

166
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
This back hand should be Dongfang Huai Zhu.

167
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I can't let him be the daughter of Zhou.

168
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
How is Young Master's bath?

169
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Do you need my service?

170
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
No need.

171
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Young Master's voice sounds a bit weak.

172
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
But his body is fine.

173
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I know a little about medicine.

174
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I can help you.

175
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
It's late.

176
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
The water is a bit cold.

177
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Maybe it's not the water that's cold.

178
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It's the young master's body that's itchy.

179
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Miss A'chu, since you're a sword master,

180
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
you should know that a sword should follow its master.

181
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
A son should be a good sword.

182
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
In your eyes,

183
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
A'chu is a sword that's not a son?

184
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It depends on you.

185
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
What you want

186
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
is not only given by Nangong.

187
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It's just

188
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
it depends on you

189
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
what kind of value you have.

190
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You want to discuss with A'chu about the chess?

191
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
But A'chu doesn't understand the chess.

192
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
If you don't fight back,

193
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
it's just a show.

194
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I think the young master of Wangquan

195
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
will endure this for a while.

196
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You're not a sword master.

197
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
What do you want?

198
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
This is not important.

199
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
What's important is

200
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
that the young master has recovered.

201
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Now it's the end of the strong-willed.

202
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I'm sorry.

203
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'm sorry.

204
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I'm sorry.

205
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I'm sorry.

206
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I'm sorry.

207
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I'm sorry.

208
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I'm sorry.

209
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
This is a bit

210
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
creepy.

211
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
These bells

212
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
are called Gia Shunling.

213
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Obviously,

214
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Nangong family has arranged

215
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
the Lin Ying Sand Formation

216
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
to welcome the young master.

217
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
These formations can make the young master feel nothing.

218
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Except for the touch,

219
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
they will disappear one by one.

220
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
First, the stomach,

221
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
then the chest.

222
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
But I'm

223
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
very well now.

224
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
You can check it again.

225
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
No scent.

226
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
How is it?

227
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Do you feel any scent?

228
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm not afraid.

229
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Good.

230
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Then you try it.

231
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I'm afraid.

232
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I'm afraid.

233
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I'm afraid.

234
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I'm afraid.

235
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'm afraid.

236
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I'm afraid.

237
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm afraid.

238
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I'm afraid.

239
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm afraid.

240
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I'm afraid.

241
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I'm afraid.

242
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I'm afraid.

243
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I'm afraid.

244
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I'm afraid.

245
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I'm afraid.

246
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm afraid.

247
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'm afraid.

248
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I'm afraid.

249
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Under this circumstance,

250
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
the young master still wouldn't give up.

251
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I admire you.

252
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,760
Let's see.

253
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,400
You're afraid that the Nangong family will know you're injured

254
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,520
and kill you.

255
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,280
If so,

256
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,160
why are you still cursing me?

257
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,640
Young Master Wang Quan and Nangong Ye are in the same alliance.

258
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,880
You don't know who curses you, right?

259
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,320
Miss Zhu,

260
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,440
I'm sorry.

261
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,600
Young Master Wang Quan,

262
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,600
Phoenix is a treasure.

263
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,700
Finary for edge of�

264
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,940
the path of prone to the silent

265
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,200
can you still stand it up?

266
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,520
Wang Quan and Hong Ye,

267
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,840
You've tried your best.

268
00:19:51,000 --> 00:20:16,400
Soul primary

269
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,960
Un Works

270
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,720
Soul intermediate

271
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,720
Don't let me down.

272
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,720
This plan is perfect.

273
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,720
The first one to die under my thousand-year demon barrier

274
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,720
is his glory.

275
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,720
I will become the leader of the Yiqi Alliance soon.

276
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,720
Yiqi Alliance

277
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,720
This spell can let you share your vision and hearing with me for the time being.

278
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,720
But you have to be within five steps away from me.

279
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,720
I'm sorry, Young Master Wang Quan.

280
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,720
Yiqi Alliance

281
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,720
Young Master, you're awake.

282
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,720
Have some tea.

283
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,720
Yiqi Alliance

284
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,720
It's you who cured me.

285
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,720
I feel better now.

286
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,720
You're so optimistic.

287
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,720
It's so charming outside.

288
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:57,720
Why don't you go out and enjoy the breeze?

289
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:13,720
One, two, three.

290
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,720
Four.

291
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,720
Five.

292
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,720
Six.

293
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,720
Within five steps, you can hear and feel the sound of the spell.

294
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,720
But if you're not within five steps away from me,

295
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,720
I can't help you.

296
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,720
I see.

297
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,720
Miss Zhu's skill is accurate.

298
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,720
Now,

299
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,720
can you cooperate with Zhu?

300
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,720
Tell me.

301
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,720
What's your plan for the opening ceremony tomorrow?

302
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,720
I'm a lowly disciple.

303
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,720
I really don't know what plan you have.

304
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,720
Then, what's your plan?

305
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,720
Being mean, hitting people, hitting people's face,

306
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,720
and hitting people's mouths.

307
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,720
You're mean and ugly.

308
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,720
You have a bad luck.

309
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,720
I just want to try the magic weapon that Brother 3 gave me.

310
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,720
You've been trying it for a whole night.

311
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,720
It's almost done.

312
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,720
And your mental control.

313
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,720
You might not win against strong opponents.

314
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,720
I'm too weak.

315
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,720
I can't use them as test subjects.

316
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,720
How do you know?

317
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,720
I can't control when I meet strong opponents.

318
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,720
Do you dare?

319
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,720
Look at my eyes.

320
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,720
You have three eyes. I can't control.

321
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,720
Who are you?

322
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,720
What's your purpose of this trip?

323
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:07,720
Young Master, you can guess.

324
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,720
I guess you're not a swordsman.

325
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,720
It's someone from the Nangong industry who asked me to deal with you.

326
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,720
Since you know who I am and you dare to take this mission,

327
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,720
I guess you must have something special.

328
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:27,720
So you think I'm here to assassinate you?

329
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:32,720
I think a smart and calm person like you

330
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,720
will not be a tool for the Nangong industry to kill people.

331
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,720
Indeed.

332
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:43,720
Nangong industry describes you as evil.

333
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,720
But I'm just a maid.

334
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,720
I'm not a scholar.

335
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:51,720
I know what the Nangong family does.

336
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,720
Then why are you here?

337
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,720
As you said,

338
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,720
good feelings will fade away.

339
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,720
Nangong industry wants Young Master's life.

340
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,720
If I save Young Master,

341
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,720
he will fulfill my conditions.

342
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,720
Young Master Wang Quan can also do it.

343
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,720
I understand.

344
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,720
Phoenix has no treasure.

345
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,720
Then may I ask you,

346
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:23,720
can you go to a place with me?

347
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,720
Help me first.

348
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,720
I can help you.

349
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,720
The Nangong people who are watching Young Master are still outside.

350
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,720
How can you get out?

351
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,720
Shadow Talisman?

352
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,720
Why is the door open?

353
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,720
Something is wrong.

354
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,720
Go tell the Master.

355
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,720
Where is Young Master going?

356
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,720
Nangong Sword Fist.

357
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,720
After this stone path, you can enter.

358
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,720
Sword Fist is the key to Nangong.

359
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,720
There is no guard on this path.

360
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,720
Is there another chance?

361
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,720
You are smart.

362
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,720
Nangong industry set up a mysterious formation outside Sword Fist.

363
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,720
Once it is opened, no one can enter.

364
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,720
Even no one is guarding the Sword Fist.

365
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,720
But...

366
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:23,720
But Nangong industry will soon find Young Master missing.

367
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,720
The place that makes him most worried is Sword Fist.

368
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,720
That's right.

369
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,720
Time is limited.

370
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,720
Please, Young Master.

371
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,720
The color of the maple leaf is so strange.

372
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,720
Because the demon in the demon's elixir is buried here.

373
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,720
This is the only Black Shadow Formation of Nangong.

374
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:17,620
Each of its

375
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,720
other forms are invisible.

376

How can I break the formation?

377
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,720
If you can't hear or see,

378
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,720
how can I direct you to break the formation?

379

I curry to you

I curry to you

429
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,720

I am love

431
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,720
I'm�ój

432
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,720
I get up to you

433
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,720
I got up to you

434
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,320
I'm you

435
00:31:44,320 --> 00:32:08,940
Yes bullet

436
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:39,940
Who are you?

437
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,340
Sister, don't touch me.

438
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,940
An'nan has a fire.

439
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,340
It will burn you.

440
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:50,940
Your name is An'nan?

441
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,340
You are?

442
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,540
She is a bee-billed bird.

443
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:56,940
A bird-bearing tribe.

444
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,540
She just turned into a human.

445
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,940
I'm afraid that she's not a human.

446
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:05,940
She's a bird.

447
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:06,940
She's a human.

448
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,940
I'll take you away right now.

449
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,940
You can't leave, An'nan.

450
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:12,940
They said that

451
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,940
when the sword is cast,

452
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,940
your mother will come back.

453
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:32,940
Your mother is inside?

454
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:33,940
Inside?

455
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:36,940
Uncle said that

456
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:39,940
they were just a burden to mother.

457
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,940
If An'nan listens to him

458
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,940
and cast the sword for her,

459
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,940
mother will definitely come back.

460
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:51,940
Who told you that?

461
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:52,940
Is it Nangongye?

462
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:00,940
She's over there.

463
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:01,940
She's over there.

464
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:03,940
Be careful.

465
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:07,940
This way.

466
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:17,940
That little boy.

467
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,940
He's fallen.

468
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:20,940
I can't escape.

469
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,940
An'nan, let's go.

470
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:28,940
Mother, run.

471
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,940
If you have a chance, save An'nan.

472
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,940
Master, that old man still ran away.

473
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,940
He's the demon king's main demon.

474
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,940
Then you don't understand.

475
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,940
Demons are mother nature.

476
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:52,940
They can't be easily defeated.

477
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,940
He won't leave.

478
00:34:58,940 --> 00:34:59,940
Let's go.

479
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:18,940
Let go of An'nan.

480
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:21,940
I'll go with you.

481
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:31,940
Mother, where's my mother?

482
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:38,940
Your name is An'nan?

483
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,940
Are all of your gods and birds

484
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,940
demons?

485
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:49,940
It's like this.

486
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,940
An'nan, I only borrowed

487
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:54,940
your mother's demon elixir to cast the sword.

488
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:57,940
A demon elixir can be reborn.

489
00:35:58,940 --> 00:35:59,940
Your mother is recuperating.

490
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,940
If you can help me to cast the sword,

491
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:05,940
I'll return your mother to you.

492
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:08,940
Okay?

493
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:11,940
The demon has been stolen.

494
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:13,940
How can it still live?

495
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:15,940
You're lying to me.

496
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:17,940
You want me to use my own demon fire

497
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,940
to cast the demon elixir of my mother?

498
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:21,940
Nangongye,

499
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,940
you'll die a hundred times.

500
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,940
The sword will be cast soon.

501
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:31,940
I'll see my mother again soon.

502
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:34,940
She lied to you.

503
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:39,940
The demon elixir can't be reborn.

504
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:46,940
Your mother is gone.

505
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:47,940
She's gone.

506
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:51,940
You lied to me.

507
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,940
I'll help you to get rid of these grudges, okay?

508
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:17,940
I'll destroy the sword gate now.

509
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,940
You can't take her away now.

510
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,940
The fire of the firebird is burning.

511
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:55,940
If the sword is cast,

512
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,940
can she still live?

513
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:58,940
The fire of the fire can't be extinguished.

514
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,940
The sword must be cast.

515
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,940
I know your feeling now.

516
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:08,940
I'll say it again.

517
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:10,940
The fire of the fire can't be extinguished.

518
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:12,940
The sword must be cast.

519
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:15,940
Otherwise, it will ruin my big plan.

520
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,940
How can the demon elixir be cast?

521
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:21,940
The fire of the fire can't be extinguished.

522
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,940
You and Nangongye are a match made in heaven.

523
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,940
I'll protect you.

524
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:31,940
You know me?

525
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,940
I don't want to make things difficult for you.

526
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,940
If you believe me again,

527
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,940
I'll give you an explanation.

528
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:43,940
Who is it?

529
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:44,940
Someone!

530
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,940
How dare you break into my forbidden place?

531
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:48,940
Come out and die!

532
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:00,940
Why should I believe you?

533
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:04,940
You are a chess player.

534
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:07,940
You can follow your instinct

535
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,940
to find out where the purple is.

536
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:49,940
The wind blows, the snow falls, the sun sets, the moon rises.

537
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:55,940
You are the light of the night.

538
00:39:55,940 --> 00:40:01,940
But how can I ask you to admit it?

539
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:08,940
I admit that I'm not afraid of you.

540
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,940
The night is getting darker.

541
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:15,940
The moon is getting darker.

542
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:21,940
I'm confused.

543
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:24,940
I don't care about the moment we meet.

544
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:27,940
I don't care about the eternity.

545
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:34,940
I don't care about the love that I have for you.

546
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:37,940
I don't care about the moment we meet.

547
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:41,940
I don't care about the time we spend together.

548
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:47,940
Maybe we have missed each other.

549
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:52,940
I don't care about the moment we meet.

550
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:55,940
I don't care about the eternity.

551
00:40:55,940 --> 00:41:01,940
I don't care about the love that I have for you.

552
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:04,940
I don't care about the moment we meet.

553
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:08,940
Maybe we have missed each other.

554
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:12,940
Maybe we have missed each other.

555
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:15,940
How can I ask you to admit it?

556
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:18,940
I don't care about the moment we meet.

557
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:22,940
