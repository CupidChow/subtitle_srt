Episode 2

6
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
If the master doesn't answer

7
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Then I can only guess that the second uncle sent people to the police station

8
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm going to the police station to get someone

9
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Yitai

10
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Don't mess around, okay?

11
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Who is messing around?

12
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Wang Quan said he would wait for him to come back

13
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You go to ask the second uncle to give us the medicine

14
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I don't know where he went

15
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
If it wasn't for Qin Lan, I don't know when I would sleep

16
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Ah Zui hasn't woken up yet

17
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Sister, what happened?

18
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Brother Yi Tan and Sister Zui were given a very powerful antidote

19
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I only have one antidote

20
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
For Brother Yi Tan

21
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Where is he?

22
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Just let me see

23
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
A Yan

24
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
A Chuan

25
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Don't worry

26
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Meng Xiaowu will be fine

27
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
They said that before we get out of Xiaowu

28
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
No one is allowed to enter

29
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Yi Tan, go out with me

30
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Go out with me

31
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Tell Nan Guangchui to come out to see me

32
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Chu Jing, come to my side

33
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Tell me loudly

34
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Why did you kill someone?

35
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Someone forced me to swallow the antidote

36
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Use the antidote to control me

37
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Kill people on the street

38
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Is this person here?

39
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Yes

40
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Show me

41
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's him

42
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Master, save me

43
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Master, you told me to do this

44
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Master, save me

45
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
If there is someone

46
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You told me to do this

47
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I want Mu Xiaowu

48
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
A Yan

49
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
With the appearance of Wang Quan

50
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Xiaowu will be out soon

51
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Master

52
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
A Zhuo

53
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
A Zhuo

54
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Little aunt

55
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
The people inside

56
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Tortured my uncle a lot

57
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
He was weak

58
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Too much blood loss

59
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Plus the meridians

60
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Even if it's a deep fire

61
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm afraid it's useless

62
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Impossible

63
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Impossible

64
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Impossible

65
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
A Zhuo

66
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
A Zhuo, save him

67
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
A Zhuo

68
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Sorry A Yan

69
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I can't save him

70
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I only have one tonic

71
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Can wake him up

72
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Say goodbye to you

73
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm sorry

74
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm sorry

75
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Xiaowu

76
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Xiaowu

77
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
A Yan

78
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
A Yan

79
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
A Yan

80
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I didn't betray the Yang family

81
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's the Yang family who betrayed you

82
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Can't say that

83
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
They are your father and brother after all

84
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
They don't know

85
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
The people in the police station will be so cruel

86
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Don't hate them

87
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
A Yan

88
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Without me in the future

89
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Also have a good meal

90
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Can pick food

91
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
But not too much

92
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Sadness is inevitable

93
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
But don't be too long

94
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Don't say anything for me

95
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Our A Yan's life

96
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Still have a long way to go

97
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I have worked in Guangdong for so many years

98
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Spent 580 taels of silver

99
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
The bank note is in your bookcase

100
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
But the money is too little

101
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Can't count your dowry

102
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I originally thought of the future

103
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
In the future, fill it up

104
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
For you

105
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Chu Jiang

106
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Chu Jiang

107
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
My death has nothing to do with you

108
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Don't blame yourself

109
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Our Chu Jiang

110
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Have seen the sun's demon

111
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
In the future

112
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
In the future

113
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Have to live a good life

114
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Be a good medicine

115
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Do you really want to live?

116
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I do

117
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Living

118
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Won't make the person you love sad

119
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Yan Yan

120
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Move away

121
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Don't go

122
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Yan Er

123
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Yan Yan

124
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Yan Er

125
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Yan Er

126
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Yan Er

127
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You are pregnant now

128
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Can't be too sad

129
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Go back with your father

130
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Go back

131
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Where to go

132
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
You

133
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Know that heartless

134
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
For a little profit

135
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Can sell the family of Zhijing

136
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Yan Er

137
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
father

138
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Don't you always ask me

139
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
What do you like about me?

140
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I can tell you today

141
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I don't want to go back

142
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Some people

143
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Born in peace

144
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
But when you see it

145
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Too noisy

146
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
To death

147
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Still persuading me not to have any grudges

148
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
And some people

149
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
In the past

150
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
But all life is in the shadow

151
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Dog dog

152
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Light pressure

153
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You

154
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I am Yan Yan today

155
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Expanded

156
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
From now on

157
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I am with the eyes of the sky

158
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
A word of grace

159
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I am Yan Yan

160
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I am Yan Yan

161
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I am Yan Yan

162
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I am Yan Yan

163
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I am Yan Yan

164
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I am Yan Yan

165
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I am Yan Yan

166
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I am Yan Yan

167
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Look at the stars

168
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Love is like a first

169
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Let me wipe it thousands of times

170
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Come and return you this life

171
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Even if the past is forgotten

172
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Look at the world

173
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I want to be alone

174
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Thank you, A'Zhu

175
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
You have to be careful

176
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Be careful to be together with this human-eating beast

177
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
You have to be careful

178
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
After you left

179
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
The sun will disappear

180
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Will it snow

181
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,840
I grew up in the South.

182
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,720
I have a wish.

183
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,000
I want to see the snow.

184
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,080
We haven't seen snow

185
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,800
in our whole life.

186
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,680
X querny

187
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:28,600
X querny

188
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,800
Thank you.

189
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,800
Chongqing, what are you doing?

190
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,800
What are you doing?

191
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,800
Chongqing, what are you doing?

192
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,800
What are you doing?

193
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,800
What are you doing?

194
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,800
What are you doing?

195
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,800
What are you doing?

196
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,800
What are you doing?

197
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,800
What are you doing?

198
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,800
What are you doing?

199
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,800
What are you doing?

200
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,800
What are you doing?

201
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,800
What are you doing?

202
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,800
What are you doing?

203
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,800
What are you doing?

204
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,800
What are you doing?

205
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,800
What are you doing?

206
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,800
What are you doing?

207
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,800
What are you doing?

208
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,800
What are you doing?

209
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,800
What are you doing?

210
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,800
What are you doing?

211
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,800
What are you doing?

212
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,800
What are you doing?

213
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,800
What are you doing?

214
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,800
What are you doing?

215
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,800
What are you doing?

216
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,800
What are you doing?

217
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,800
What are you doing?

218
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,800
What are you doing?

219
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,800
What are you doing?

220
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,800
What are you doing?

221
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,800
What are you doing?

222
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,800
What are you doing?

223
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,800
What are you doing?

224
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,800
What are you doing?

225
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,800
What are you doing?

226
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,800
What are you doing?

227
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,800
What are you doing?

228
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,800
What are you doing?

229
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,800
What are you doing?

230
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,800
What are you doing?

231
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,800
What are you doing?

232
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,800
What are you doing?

233
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,800
What are you doing?

234
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,800
What are you doing?

235
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,800
What are you doing?

236
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,800
What are you doing?

237
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,800
What are you doing?

238
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,800
What are you doing?

239
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,800
What are you doing?

240
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,800
What are you doing?

241
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,800
What are you doing?

242
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,800
What are you doing?

243
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,800
What are you doing?

244
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,800
What are you doing?

245
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,800
What are you doing?

246
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,800
What are you doing?

247
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,800
What are you doing?

248
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,800
What are you doing?

249
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,800
What are you doing?

250
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,800
What are you doing?

251
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,800
What are you doing?

252
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,800
What are you doing?

253
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,800
What are you doing?

254
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,800
What are you doing?

255
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,800
What are you doing?

256
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,800
What are you doing?

257
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,800
What are you doing?

258
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,800
What are you doing?

259
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,800
What are you doing?

260
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,800
What are you doing?

261
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,800
What are you doing?

262
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,800
What are you doing?

263
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,800
What are you doing?

264
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,800
What are you doing?

265
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,800
What are you doing?

266
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,800
What are you doing?

267
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,800
What are you doing?

268
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,800
What are you doing?

269
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,800
What are you doing?

270
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,800
What are you doing?

271
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,800
What are you doing?

272
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,800
What are you doing?

273
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,800
What are you doing?

274
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,800
What are you doing?

275
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,800
What are you doing?

276
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,800
Everything is done

277
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,300
Dong Fang, Master

278
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,800
Don't believe you betray� the Nangong Mansion

279
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,800
So you can do whatever you wish

280
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,400
Without anyone's help, you dare to fight with me?

281
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,000
Why should I fight with you?

282
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:54,500
I'm the one who killed the demon in the

283
00:21:55,500 --> 00:22:03,100
Who knows if he was framed by Wang Quan's family?

284
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,900
The Jichas' martial law

285
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,900
In your eyes

286
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,700
Is it really worthless?

287
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:39,300
Even if these jade talismans

288
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:43,300
I bought them, so what?

289
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:46,100
Wang Quan Hongye

290
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,700
Don't be fake anymore

291
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,300
You oppose the jade talisman

292
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:58,900
It's just that I want to fight against my Nan Gong family

293
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,900
Between your sects

294
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,300
Those fearless battles

295
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:06,300
But use Chu Jing and Mu Xiaowu

296
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,300
These innocent people and demons

297
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,300
To frame?

298
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,500
The first law of the Jichas

299
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,500
The law is clear

300
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,500
No one is allowed to kill

301
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,700
Wang Quan

302
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,100
The evidence is all here

303
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,100
Yi Qingmeng

304
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:36,500
Can you give Mu Xiaowu and Chu Jing an explanation?

305
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,500
Yes

306
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,300
And the jade talisman

307
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,300
If you don't care

308
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,300
You can't kill me

309
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,900
There is a jade talisman

310
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,500
If you don't care

311
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,500
I'll take care of it

312
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,700
I care

313
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,300
Sister

314
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,900
The people of the Jichas killed Mu Xiaowu

315
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,300
This is really not your fault

316
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,700
And Wang Quan said

317
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,900
Do you want him to avenge Mu Xiaowu?

318
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,700
Today's matter

319
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,700
With love and etiquette

320
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,700
I should say thank you

321
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,500
Qinglan, wait for me

322
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,700
Sister

323
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,500
Shao Shu

324
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,300
I have lost my only daughter

325
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:45,100
Even if it's my fault

326
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:48,900
I have paid enough price

327
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:53,100
I hope Wang Quan's family can forgive me

328
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,700
You

329
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:01,100
For your own sake

330
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,900
The strength of the Yizu

331
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,300
Help the curse

332
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:08,100
The innocent die

333
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,900
How dare you say you forgive me

334
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,300
I came to the Yang family to make a decision

335
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:16,100
I will make a big statement on Mu Xiaowu

336
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,300
As long as you survive tonight

337
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,500
Mu Xiaowu will not die

338
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,700
I can get rid of all the poison in the Jichas

339
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,900
Young master

340
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:31,700
I am already a man who has been buried in the soil

341
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:35,900
I have a hope

342
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,500
Today is my fault

343
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,300
If you don't give up

344
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:43,700
I will die

345
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,300
Enough

346
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,900
Enough

347
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,100
Master Yang

348
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,300
Listen carefully

349
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:06,100
If there is a next time

350
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:09,500
I will take the credit

351
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,900
I will not be lenient

352
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,160
Do you scram

353
00:26:54,100 --> 00:27:07,340
How

354
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:13,500
Young Master Meng Quan is so cunning and scheming.

355
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,500
It's my fault.

356
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:26,500
I forgot that it's dangerous to be cunning and scheming.

357
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:33,500
In the eyes of others, the lives of their families are just a dream.

358
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:39,500
But I chose to help Yan in this way.

359
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:46,500
If the Yang family hadn't handed over Mu Xiaowu, things wouldn't have been like this.

360
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:53,500
But Mu Xiaowu died and Chu Qing was gone.

361
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:59,500
Yan's happiness was also buried.

362
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,500
I'm Wang Quan.

363
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,500
I have something to do.

364
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,500
I can't lose.

365
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,500
Young Master Meng Quan,

366
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,500
I'm sorry.

367
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,500
I'm sorry.

368
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,500
Young Master Meng Quan,

369
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:33,500
do you still remember your promise to Chu Jing?

370
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,500
You won't go back to Kuangdong anymore.

371
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,500
I'll protect your brother Wu.

372
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,500
Really?

373
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,500
Just a word.

374
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:51,500
In Chu Jing's life, there are not many people who are willing to make promises to him.

375
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,500
That's why he's so cautious of you.

376
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,500
I used to think that Young Master Meng Quan was not the Wang Quan I imagined.

377
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,500
I was naive.

378
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,500
Young Master Meng Quan,

379
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,500
goodbye.

380
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,500
I'll never see you again.

381
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,500
In the memorial tablet of the Bureau of Investigation,

382
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,500
the duty of the Bureau of Investigation

383
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,500
is to punish evil and help the good.

384
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,500
It's a ring

385
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:52,420
that can be used to hold the

386
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:57,420
head of the Yiqi Alliance.

387
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:20,160
It can't be used to cut off the

388
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,160
head of the Yiqi Alliance.

389
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:27,160
I did the right thing.

390
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,160
But why

391
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,160
am I still sad?

392
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,160
I've tried my best.

393
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,160
If you want to blame me,

394
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,160
it's because I didn't protect the Yang family.

395
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:54,160
How many Mu Xiaowu and Chu Jing

396
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,160
are there in this world?

397
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,160
Why

398
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,160
are there people who are loyal and loyal to die?

399
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,160
The heartless family is on fire.

400
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,160
We are already

401
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,160
deep in the heart.

402
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,160
We are already

403
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,160
deep in the darkest world.

404
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,160
Can this night

405
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,160
really be cut off?

406
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,160
The price of sacrifice

407
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,160
is really worth it?

408
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,160
You're back.

409
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,160
The two girls

410
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,160
must not have eaten.

411
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,160
I just cooked noodles.

412
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,160
Let's go.

413
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,160
I'm not hungry.

414
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:09,160
I know about the Yang family.

415
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,160
There are always great difficulties and grievances.

416
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,160
These days

417
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,160
still have to go on every day.

418
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,160
I remember one thing.

419
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,160
Chu Tao Men.

420
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,160
Sister.

421
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,160
Jinglan, let her go.

422
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,160
That day,

423
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,160
the mountain was covered with bugs.

424
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,160
Looking back,

425
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,160
it's a long way to go.

426
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,160
It's okay.

427
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,160
It will pass.

428
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,160
Come on.

429
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,160
Come on.

430
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,160
Come on.

431
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,160
Eat while it's hot.

432
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,160
The sand sand group.

433
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,160
The Ruyi House has been closed.

434
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,160
Come back tomorrow.

435
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,160
I'm not here to buy jewelry.

436
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,160
You can leave now.

437
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,160
I want to buy a piece of information

438
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,160
for Miss Qingmu.

439
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,160
Today, Yang Yan is willing to cut his hair

440
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,160
and cut off his relationship with the Yang family.

441
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,160
Miss Huai Zhu

442
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,160
wants to know about him.

443
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,160
Yes.

444
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,160
I want to know

445
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,160
where Yang Yan is now.

446
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,160
Please give me a price.

447
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,160
Miss Huai Zhu is kind and thoughtful.

448
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,160
I'm willing to give you

449
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,160
this piece of information.

450
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,160
In seven days,

451
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,160
I will give you

452
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,160
a satisfactory answer.

453
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,160
Thank you.

454
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,160
I don't know

455
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,160
how you and Wang Quan

456
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,160
are getting along.

457
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,160
But I hope

458
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,160
you and I can know it.

459
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,160
Yes.

460
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,160
I promise you

461
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,160
that I will tell you

462
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,160
about this matter

463
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,160
without any hesitation.

464
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,160
After the meeting of the Yiqi Alliance yesterday,

465
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:44,160
the Bureau of Investigation changed its position to the position of the members of the different families.

466
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,160
Except for Zhang Zheng,

467
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,160
the rest of the families agreed to the position.

468
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,160
Nan Gongchui has been locked in the Soul Sky Prison.

469
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,160
He went in after the meeting yesterday.

470
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,160
He ordered the chief to kill the demons.

471
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,160
The evidence is clear.

472
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,160
He can't escape.

473
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,160
He killed the evil people

474
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,160
in the Soul Sky Prison.

475
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,160
It's time to end

476
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,160
these hatreds.

477
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,160
I understand.

478
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,160
You...

479
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,160
What do you want?

480
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,160
Wang Quan, Wu Yue.

481
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,160
Wang Quan, Wu Yue.

482
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,160
Isn't this

483
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,160
Nan Gongchui,

484
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,160
who killed the evil people?

485
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,160
I'm sorry.

486
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,160
You're too old.

487
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,160
That's right.

488
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,160
It's him.

489
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:59,160
He dug my daughter's belt.

490
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,160
He gave it to Nan Gongchui.

491
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,160
What are you doing?

492
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,160
Who are you?

493
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,160
What are you doing?

494
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,160
I'm telling you.

495
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,160
They locked me in the place.

496
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,160
I...

497
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,160
I shouldn't be here.

498
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,160
Go away.

499
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,160
You damn demons.

500
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,160
Stay away.

501
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,160
Stay away.

502
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,160
You...

503
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,160
You...

504
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,160
You...

505
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,160
You...

506
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,160
You...

507
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,160
You...

508
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,160
You...

509
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,160
You...

510
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,160
You...

511
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,160
You...

512
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,160
You...

513
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,160
You...

514
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,160
You...

515
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,160
You...

516
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,160
You...

517
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,160
You...

518
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,160
You...

519
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,160
You...

520
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,160
You...

521
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,160
You...

522
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,160
You...

523
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,160
You...

524
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,160
You...

525
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,160
You...

526
00:38:55,160 --> 00:39:01,160
You...

527
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,160
Go...

528
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,160
Go...

529
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:27,160
