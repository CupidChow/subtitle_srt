1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,640
Actually.

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,160
Love and hate are both

3
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,040
Flowing

4
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,640
With tears as the wind

5
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,720
Chatting like a butterfly

6
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,960
Don't turn back and keep walking

7
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,800
Life and death go forward

8
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,280
From the fire to the fire

9
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,560
Whose love

10
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,080
Is more vast than the universe

11
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,320
Don't turn back and keep walking

12
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,200
Life and death go forward

13
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,640
From the fire to the fire

14
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,920
Whose love

15
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,600
Is more vast than the universe

16
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,600
It's me

17
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,000
The Long Ballad

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,040
Good things, good things, delicious, delicious

19
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,840
Good bread invites you to watch the water-returning kitchen

20
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:07,200
The Long Ballad

21
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,200
Let go

22
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,200
Let go

23
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,200
Let go

24
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,200
Let go

25
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,200
Let go

26
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,200
Lord Jiuhuo, forgive me

27
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:43,200
I can't go back to the Snow Mountain with you this time

28
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,200
Let go

29
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,200
Let go

30
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,200
Let go

31
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,200
Let go

32
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,200
Let go

33
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,200
Let go

34
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,200
Let go

35
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,200
Let go

36
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,200
Let go

37
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,200
Although the little fox's body is destroyed

38
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,200
It can still draw out its primordial spirit

39
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,200
Since you love each other so much

40
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,200
Then I will give you

41
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,200
Here forever

42
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,200
To accompany this demon

43
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,200
The king of the Demon Kingdom

44
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,200
Lies to Jialan

45
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,200
And sealed Jiuhuo

46
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,200
He is holding the Demon Token

47
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,200
And walking in the world

48
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,200
He didn't expect

49
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,200
Jialan's primordial spirit

50
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,200
Can absorb the hatred of the world

51
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,200
This ability is beyond imagination

52
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,200
Liar

53
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,200
You are a liar

54
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,200
Liar

55
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,200
You are all liars

56
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,200
They say I'm bad

57
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,200
But you are even worse

58
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,200
Everyone in this world

59
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,200
Is not worthy of light

60
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,200
If so

61
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,200
Why don't I become darkness

62
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,200
So hatred

63
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,200
Will make people so depressed

64
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:42,200
Wouldn't it be better if it was like this earlier?

65
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:46,200
I'm so hungry now

66
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,200
Where to eat

67
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,200
Let's go to the Demon Kingdom

68
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,200
Jialan walked into the Demon Kingdom overnight

69
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,200
The dead living beings have endless hatred

70
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,200
He absorbed these hatred into his body

71
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,200
His power is getting stronger

72
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,200
He can not only control the medicine, but also control people

73
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,200
He let them kill each other

74
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,200
He continued to hate and continue to repudiate Jialan

75
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,200
Just like this

76
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,200
He finally completely lost himself

77
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,200
Become the black fox

78
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,200
The black fox has no body

79
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,200
He used hatred as a weapon

80
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,200
Kill everywhere

81
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,200
So later on

82
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,200
Aolai Sanshao tried his best

83
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,200
Block the black fox outside the circle

84
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,200
Look here

85
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,200
The evil aura under the altar

86
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:47,200
Was the innocent people sacrificed by the king and the north mountain tribe

87
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,200
This is the secret you have always wanted to cover

88
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,200
Can be the devil

89
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,200
Even if the king knows this secret

90
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,200
Who will care

91
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,200
You are right

92
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,200
But among the 36 masters of the Demon Kingdom

93
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,200
There is one master

94
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,200
Loved a female demon

95
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,200
Spent all his efforts to study the method of breaking the Demon's Talisman

96
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,200
And wrote it in this secret room

97
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,200
Since there is a way to break it

98
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,200
Why doesn't he use it

99
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,200
Once the Demon's Talisman is broken

100
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,200
Those demons who have suffered for a long time

101
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,200
The demon who has lost his control

102
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,200
The demons who have lost their control have to die

103
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,200
The demons will be crazy

104
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,200
To take the teeth back

105
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,200
To be happy

106
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,200
The road to the Demon's Talisman has no way back

107
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,200
So he can only give up

108
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,200
I am sorry for your loss

109
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,200
The black fox still exists

110
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,200
The road to the Demon's Talisman will not end

111
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,200
No

112
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,200
As long as the black fox is destroyed

113
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,200
Everything can end

114
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,200
Bommu

115
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,200
I need the names of all the masters in this pit

116
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,200
Is the medicine ready

117
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,200
Almost

118
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,200
Sister Mo Yun

119
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,200
Who did you prepare this Ganfeng Ling

120
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,200
Miss Dongfang said

121
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,200
The master guarded the night yesterday

122
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,200
Made several sprays

123
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,200
Sister recognized the master so quickly

124
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,200
They look quite good together

125
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,200
No no no

126
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,200
Although Wang Quan is good at explaining to me

127
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,200
But the mask brother is not bad

128
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,200
What are you doing with flowers

129
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,200
Uncertain

130
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,200
Why don't you ask the gods

131
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,200
You don't want me to count the petals, do you

132
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,200
Really old

133
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,200
Boring

134
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,200
Don't want to take it back

135
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,200
Humph

136
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,200
I didn't expect Qin Lan to care so much about me and the mask

137
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,200
Tell him

138
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,200
He should know

139
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,200
Qin Lan is about to leave

140
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,200
Big brother sent you a gift

141
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,200
Humph

142
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,200
No bow no way

143
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,200
I don't want it

144
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,200
Do you want to see it first

145
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,200
Dongfang little heroine

146
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,200
You you you

147
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,200
Humph

148
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,200
Sister

149
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,200
You knew it a long time ago, didn't you

150
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,200
Your sister

151
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,200
I just knew it a while ago

152
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,200
Feel

153
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,200
Not big enough

154
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,200
I'll give you a gift

155
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,200
Little heroine

156
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,200
Good evening

157
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,200
You dog even you bully me

158
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,200
See how I take you

159
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,200
Stop Lin Quzhuo

160
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,200
Stop

161
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,200
I'll give you a step

162
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,200
You just chase it

163
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,200
Good you dog

164
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,200
I was the master of you for so long

165
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,200
You didn't leave at all

166
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,200
Caused me to be in Wang Quan brother-in-law

167
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,200
Struggle between the mask brother-in-law

168
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,200
Your conscience was eaten by the dog

169
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,200
Okay

170
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,200
This matter

171
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,200
I'm sorry

172
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,200
Humph

173
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,200
So

174
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,200
I can promise you a condition

175
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,200
What conditions can be

176
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,200
That must still be reasonable

177
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,200
But Qin Lan is so educated

178
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,200
Everyone is so polite

179
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,200
I'm sure it won't be hard on me

180
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,200
So boring

181
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,200
I think

182
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,200
You just want to coax me out

183
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,200
So that your brother and my sister

184
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,200
Have a chance to get along alone

185
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,200
You see

186
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,200
This is the last night in the Demon Kingdom

187
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,200
We'll give them more

188
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,200
A little bit of private space

189
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,200
Let them

190
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,200
Let them be together

191
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,200
And

192
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,200
I also have something to tell you

193
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,200
What

194
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,200
After these days

195
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,200
We are also

196
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:31,200
Brothers and sisters who share the same

197
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,200
I was a young man

198
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,200
There is a white horse

199
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,200
But painting is great

200
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,200
So I also learned painting

201
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,200
And then

202
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,200
And then

203
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,200
Then he moved

204
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,200
Gone

205
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,200
What about you

206
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,200
I

207
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,200
Of course I have

208
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,200
Just

209
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,200
I haven't opened my mouth yet

210
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,200
He has already run away

211
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,200
May be

212
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,200
It's not a fate

213
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,200
It's okay

214
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,200
Don't be discouraged

215
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,200
This is for you

216
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,200
Wait for you

217
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,200
I met the girl I like

218
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,200
Just give this to her

219
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,200
This

220
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,200
You made it yourself

221
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,200
Of course not

222
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,200
But I bought it myself

223
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,200
I saw it on the market

224
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,200
I saw it on the market and thought it was beautiful

225
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,200
I thought I could give it to you

226
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,200
I bought it with a heart

227
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,200
I'll keep it

228
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,200
I also have a gift for you

229
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,200
What

230
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,200
Transferring talisman

231
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,200
In the future, you will be in danger

232
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,200
Whether in the enchantment

233
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,200
Or in the formation

234
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,200
Drive this talisman

235
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,200
It can immediately transfer you to ten miles away

236
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,200
Thank you

237
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,200
That

238
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,200
Take care

239
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,200
Ten miles

240
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,200
Ten miles

241
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,200
Dad

242
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,200
Lan told me

243
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,200
You come back

244
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,200
Just one person

245
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,200
Come to the back mountain

246
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,200
I'm back in the mountain villa

247
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,200
Why don't you say hello to dad?

248
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,200
Good good good

249
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,200
Don't say anything if you don't want to say

250
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,200
Just come back safely

251
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,200
Lan'er this girl

252
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,200
When she came in and saw me

253
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,200
Just gave me a hug

254
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,200
I can't wait

255
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,200
Say a few words to her

256
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,200
This girl

257
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,200
Turn around and start the way

258
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,200
The fresh stuff brought over

259
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,200
I think

260
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,200
On this journey

261
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,200
Reaching a lot of success

262
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,200
We

263
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,200
We saw mom

264
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,200
So

265
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,200
You know her story

266
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,200
Also saw

267
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,200
Saw her presence

268
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,200
Yes

269
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,200
Your mother

270
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,200
Is it still like the old days

271
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,200
So beautiful

272
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,200
If she sees me now

273
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,200
Dad's style is not the same as that year

274
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,200
Really

275
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,200
Really

276
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,200
Good

277
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,200
Mom also said

278
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,200
Let us hug you for her

279
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,200
Dad

280
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,200
Dad

281
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,200
Dad

282
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,200
Dad

283
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,200
Dad

284
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,200
These years

285
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,200
You have worked hard

286
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,200
I'm sorry

287
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,200
See you two

288
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,200
Grow up happily

289
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,200
Dad is satisfied

290
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,200
Dad

291
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,200
Dad

292
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,200
Are you leaving?

293
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,200
From the day you were in the dark

294
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,200
I investigated your everything

295
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,200
I'm sure you are innocent

296
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,200
Also sure

297
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,200
You deliberately entered the prison

298
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,200
Soon

299
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,200
I confirmed your purpose

300
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,200
You want to approach me

301
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,200
Attract me

302
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,200
And the sad thing

303
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,200
I know so

304
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,200
Still willing to enter the prison

305
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,200
I still know

306
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,200
You are actually not ordinary

307
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,200
Always deliberately hidden

308
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,200
So

309
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,200
I have been preparing something

310
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,200
Want to be

311
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,200
A gift to propose to you

312
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,200
I observe your right hand scissors distribution

313
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,200
Feel

314
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,200
Ying is using a sword

315
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,200
I want to tell you

316
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,200
I won't ask your whereabouts

317
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,200
In front of me

318
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,200
You just need to be yourself

319
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,200
I think you are confused

320
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,200
Jianming is out of school

321
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,200
I was thinking

322
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,200
On the day of school

323
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,200
I want you to propose

324
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,200
But I'm leaving

325
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,200
I am weak

326
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,200
Can't allow you to be rich

327
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,200
But can allow you

328
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,200
One heart one mind

329
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,200
Night road has lights

330
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,200
Cold day has warmth

331
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,200
Uncle has no movement

332
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,200
If you want to pass

333
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,200
I said

334
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,200
I'm leaving

335
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,200
If you insist on leaving

336
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,200
Please do this sword

337
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,200
You just need to remember

338
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,200
Someone sincerely

339
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,200
I would like to light up your life

340
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,200
Since

341
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,200
He doesn't regret it at all

342
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,200
I'm leaving

343
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,200
A word of advice

344
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,200
The words I just said

345
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,200
Is it still me

346
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,200
I'm old

347
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,200
Wife

348
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,200
Thank you for doing me a favor

349
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,200
I'm sorry

350
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,200
I'm sorry

351
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,200
I'm sorry

352
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,200
I'm sorry

353
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,200
I'm sorry

354
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,200
I'm sorry

355
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,200
I'm sorry

356
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,200
I'm sorry

357
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,200
I'm sorry

358
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,200
Thank you for staying for me at that time

359
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,200
And for me

360
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,200
Two such good daughters

361
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,200
Wife

362
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,200
You didn't leave too late

363
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,200
I'm sorry

364
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,200
As promised

365
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,200
I'll see you in the next life

366
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,200
I'm the first again today

367
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,560
I'll read it out loud.

368
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,200
What are you reading?

369
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,560
I'm reading out loud because I'm drunk.

370
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,120
You're not even educated.

371
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,120
But you have to tell me the street code first.

372
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,320
What street code?

373
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,480
Am I close to you?

374
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:52,760
It's...

375
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,120
It's...

376
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,040
It's...

377
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,040
It's...

378
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,080
It's...

379
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,080
It's...

380
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,080
It's...

381
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,080
It's...

382
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,080
It's...

383
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,080
It's...

384
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,080
It's...

385
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,920
It's my fault, everyone else had to leave.

386
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,000
Didn't you have a meal with me?

387
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,400
Sister.

388
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,520
Where are you off to?

389
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,240
I strolled around in search of fun,

390
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,160
hoping I'd see my dad's grave.

391
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,360
Was it really your dad's grave?

392
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,120
I'm not your dad.

393
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,320
It was always a grave.

394
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,200
Never even thought I would be able to see it again.

395
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,240
Why are you guys late?

396
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,760
We have to hurry!

397
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:36,760
We gathered the secret code this time to unlock the mask of the world.

398
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,760
Brother, why don't you bring the mask that sister-in-law gave you?

399
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,760
I'll change it then.

400
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,760
What have you experienced this time?

401
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,760
We experienced... growth.

402
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,760
Oh, oh, oh, oh

403
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,760
Oh, oh, oh, oh

404
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,760
My sister-in-law is indeed good.

405
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,760
My brother finally has a new style.

406
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,760
I just changed the mask.

407
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,760
What's so strange?

408
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,760
Showing affection.

409
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,760
Then from now on, I'll announce a few things.

410
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,760
Okay.

411
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:45,760
The first thing is that the mask group has a new member today.

412
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,760
Black Sword Zhang Zheng?

413
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:02,760
Hey, sister-in-law, did he come here to chase you?

414
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,760
I came to light the fire.

415
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,760
Light the fire?

416
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,760
Do you know what we're going to do? You're going to light the fire?

417
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,760
He said,

418
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,760
Stop the demon from competing, break the darkness, and destroy the black tiger.

419
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,760
Although the target is small,

420
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,760
I believe in you.

421
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,760
Black Sword Zhang Zheng, one sword breaks the darkness.

422
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,760
From today on, join the mask group.

423
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,760
Rank the eighth.

424
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,760
Hello, eighth brother.

425
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,760
Black Sword Zhang Zheng

426
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,760
It looks better than I imagined.

427
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:16,760
Sister Qingwen, Zhang Zheng's family is done with you.

428
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,760
It's all in the past.

429
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,760
Next, I will announce the second thing.

430
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,760
This time, I found a way to deal with the black tiger.

431
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,760
The black tiger hates you.

432
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,760
It's powerful.

433
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:32,760
If you want to destroy the black tiger, you have to stop the demon from competing.

434
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:36,760
The Yiqi Alliance is time to take off the mask.

435
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,760
Come out.

436
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,760
First Brother,

437
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,760
It's late at night. Why are you back?

438
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,760
Shouldn't I be asking you this?

439
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,760
You've been away from me for a few days.

440
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,760
What are you doing here?

441
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,760
First Brother, I'm actually...

442
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,760
You're not going to tell me?

443
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,760
I'm not going to tell you.

444
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,760
First Brother, I'm actually...

445
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,760
First Brother, I'm sorry.

446
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,760
Please forgive me this time.

447
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,760
When you were stealing last time,

448
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,760
what did I tell you?

449
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,760
You forgot so quickly.

450
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,760
First Brother, you can't tell me about this.

451
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,760
He will definitely get me out of the manor.

452
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,760
First Brother, First Brother, First Brother.

453
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,760
Isn't it just a few money?

454
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,760
First Brother.

455
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,760
Take it.

456
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,760
Xiaodong,

457
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,760
I know you like gambling.

458
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,760
I also know you're not willing to be a slave.

459
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,760
You're just like me.

460
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,760
You're a person with a ambition.

461
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,760
You're a person with a ambition.

462
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,760
Listen to me.

463
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,760
From now on, the chief manager of the fire and the mountain villa

464
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,760
is yours.

465
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,760
Uncle Fei,

466
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,760
you sent me five meals a day.

467
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,760
Is there anything wrong?

468
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,760
You've been away from home for a long time.

469
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,760
I'm very idle.

470
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,760
By the way, Young Master,

471
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,760
your 26th birthday is coming.

472
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,760
I don't know what you're planning.

473
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,760
Uncle Fei,

474
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,760
I'm suddenly tired.

475
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,760
Okay.

476
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,760
Uncle Fei.

477
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,760
Uncle Fei.

478
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,760
Uncle Fei, what did my brother say about the birthday?

479
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,760
As usual.

480
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,760
Ten years.

481
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,760
Why is my brother still so stubborn?

482
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,760
He doesn't want to celebrate his birthday.

483
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,760
Everything is always right.

484
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,760
In fact, the person who can shine on my brother's heart

485
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,760
has already appeared.

486
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,760
That's right.

487
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,760
We can find Sister-in-law.

488
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,760
Let's go.

489
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,760
Let's go.

490
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,760
By the way, inform the others.

491
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,760
It's better to be lively.

492
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,760
Young people.

493
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,760
Ah Zui.

494
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,760
Sister-in-law, you know my brother.

495
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,760
My brother is a boring person.

496
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,760
He always keeps things in his stomach.

497
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:58,760
Every year, we want to celebrate his birthday for him.

498
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,760
Actually, I think

499
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,760
as long as he's happy, that's good.

500
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,760
If he really doesn't want to,

501
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,760
then we can celebrate his birthday for him.

502
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,760
I think

503
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,760
as long as he's happy, that's good.

504
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,760
If he really doesn't want to,

505
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,760
then we can celebrate his birthday for him.

506
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,760
But this year is different.

507
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,760
With you,

508
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,760
we can try it.

509
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,760
Sister-in-law.

510
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,760
If there's nothing important,

511
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,760
don't bother me today.

512
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,760
Why?

513
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,760
You don't welcome me?

514
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,760
Why are you here?

515
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,760
I've never been to Wangquan Villa.

516
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,760
Young Master Wangquan, should you be the host?

517
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,760
Take me to see around.

518
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,760
Of course.

519
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,760
Hongye.

520
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,760
Why it's your birthday

521
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,760
all these years?

522
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,760
I'm waiting for

523
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,760
a person and a late blessing.

524
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,520
Got it.

525
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:50,960
Dad.

526
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,120
Are you looking for me?

527
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,360
I can't believe

528
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,960
Hong Ye

529
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,440
has graduated his gosto.

530
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,280
It's just three more days.

531
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:08,440
Yes.

532
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,360
I've known all the words to be a paso.

533
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,200
The ceremony is completed.

534
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,240
From now on, I hope...

535
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,880
Father, you should tell me the words

536
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,040
when you bring me the coffin three days later.

537
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:24,960
Yes.

538
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,080
I'm confused.

539
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,840
I'll wait for you to come back

540
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,920
to perform the ceremony and celebrate my birthday.

541
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,200
Good.

542
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,040
Yes.

543
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,080
So the blessing in the coffin

544
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,760
became my heart.

545
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:47,960
Of course,

546
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,680
it's to keep

547
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,800
the memory of my father.

548
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,520
However,

549
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,200
although I lost a family,

550
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,640
now,

551
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,400
I have a new family

552
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,440
of the Masked Club.

553
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,800
And you.

554
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,600
So I think

555
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,800
all of this

556
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,280
is really worth celebrating.

557
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,400
Are you all listening?

558
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,720
If you don't come out,

559
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
you won't have food

560
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,280
and drink.

561
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:39,480
Friends of the Stir-fried Boil Sour害

562
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,040
Brother Wowa,

563
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,600
since when did you find us?

564
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,400
Best to hide yourself in the future.

565
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,480
Is there a reason we之事 CHANшие?

566
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,120
I have no likely interest in checks and balances.

567
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,120
Brother,

568
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,320
then I'll turn into a stone

569
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,800
and walk green,

570
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,960
holding an arrow away.

571
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,320
A perfect example for us.

572
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,280
Schneider,

573
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,200
Brother,

574
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,400
I'll be a rock.

575
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,400
I'm sure it's okay.

576
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,160
There's a rock in our yard.

577
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,200
Can't I find it?

578
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,040
And you, Yitan.

579
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,360
You're the one who's holding me, right?

580
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,400
No.

581
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,240
It's just that my wife and I

582
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,360
have been thinking about it.

583
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,560
What about the other two?

584
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,360
They can't make it here,

585
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,120
but they prepared the dishes.

586
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,280
Since the atmosphere is here,

587
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,840
I'll wish my brother

588
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,000
a happy birthday.

589
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,480
A gift for a year.

590
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,480
A year of happiness.

591
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,880
Happy birthday.

592
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,320
Here.

593
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:43,520
Here.

594
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,640
What about

595
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,640
my gift?

596
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,760
It's my first birthday after more than ten years.

597
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,760
I didn't get a gift.

598
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,160
Brother,

599
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,120
you didn't say you wanted a pot.

600
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,520
So what we're doing

601
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,440
isn't the gift you want.

602
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,720
Let's go.

603
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,640
What are you doing?

604
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,720
Brother,

605
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,120
look at you.

606
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,960
I can't scare you

607
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,320
if you give me a surprise.

608
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,680
Forget it.

609
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,440
I don't want my brother.

610
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,560
Come on, sister-in-law.

611
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,920
Let's have another drink.

612
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:50,720
Xiaoqi.

613
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Brother,

614
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,800
do you have any good wine?

615
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:55,960
I want to drink.

616
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,360
Drink it all.

617
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,360
I'll get it.

618
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,680
There's a lot of wine.

619
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Anyway, tonight,

620
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,400
let's drink till we're drunk.

621
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,120
Cheers.

622
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,680
Cheers.

623
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:01,880
Thank you.

624
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,560
I'm happy today.

625
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,600
Me too.

626
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,280
Wait for me.

627
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:31,880
oodsef

628
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,520
Look,

629
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,400
it's up to me

630
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,040
to take care of things

631
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,760
Milady,

632
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,400
and I can go finish

633
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,680
July 7th.

634
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,800
The fireflies are wandering in the night sky.

635
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,560
After the wine is warm,

636
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,160
the heart is full of love.

637
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,760
It's good.

638
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,160
But...

639
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,320
But what?

640
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,480
But the edict

641
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,720
is black and white.

642
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,960
And the edict is ugly.

643
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,000
I have some more.

644
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:27,920
Take a look.

645
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:33,320
The mountains are not yet in full bloom, but they are still moving.

646
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,840
Why are there so many?

647
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,240
Because I didn't write it down before.

648
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,240
So I wrote a few more.

649
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,280
Of course,

650
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,080
you know my beauty.

651
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,240
This...

652
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,000
How is it?

653
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,640
Is it wrong?

654
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,600
What about this?

655
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,360
With my hands,

656
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,240
please let me

657
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,680
write it down.

658
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,000
Then this...

659
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,280
How to stop the wind?

660
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,760
How to stop the clouds?

661
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:28,000
How to stop the wind?

662
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,760
How to stop the wind?

663
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,160
How to stop the clouds?

664
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:38,960
How to stop the clouds?

665
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,440
How to stop the clouds?

666
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,960
How to stop the clouds?

667
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,560
How to stop the clouds?

668
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,640
How to stop the clouds?

669
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,320
How to stop the clouds?

670
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,840
Where do you want to go?

671
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:00,720
Do you want to ஆ陞?

672
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,240
Don't?

673
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,680
I would do anything toё

674
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,400
Only through public zither

675
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,280
can I 예뻐

676
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:12,120
to Mic Canvas

677
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:17,560
Wang Ziyuan

678
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:23,560
I'll use my thousands of words to wipe your sword

679
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:26,560
I'll exchange you for my whole life

680
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,560
Even if we forget each other

681
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,560
I'll still look at the world

682
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:34,560
I'll take your beauty as my sword

683
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:38,560
I'll only look at you from afar

684
00:41:47,560 --> 00:42:04,560
Ah...

685
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:09,560
I'll use my thousands of words to wipe your sword

686
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:13,560
I'll exchange you for my whole life

687
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,560
Even if we forget each other

688
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:18,560
I'll still look at you from afar

689
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,560
I'll only look at you from afar

690
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:25,560
I'll only look at you from afar
