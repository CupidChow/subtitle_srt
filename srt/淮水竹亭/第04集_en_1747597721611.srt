00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Previous episode ...

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Now

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Now

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
To be continued ...

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
To be continued ...

6
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Immortal Hongye,

7
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
you appeared in my house at night.

8
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
What's the reason?

9
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I drank too much and came out for a walk.

10
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I was suddenly curious about the location of your demon elixir.

11
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So I came here.

12
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I just didn't think that you would knock on the soul of the Gu Ling while I was not ready.

13
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Master,

14
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Wang Quan used the shadow talisman to get away from my sight.

15
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I chased after the sword furnace and found that he had broken the Xuan Yin Formation.

16
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So I immediately triggered the Gu Ling.

17
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You are really something.

18
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
If you want to see it, just say it.

19
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Why are you so sneaky?

20
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You even made us all worried.

21
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's just a matter of taste.

22
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
But your little sword is very important.

23
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It's a waste of my life.

24
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
If you don't like it,

25
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'll change my clothes.

26
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
No.

27
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm not a person who likes to wear clothes.

28
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
No.

29
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I like...

30
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
...people with bad temper.

31
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Let's go.

32
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Father,

33
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
you've checked it eight hundred times.

34
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
The sword furnace is fine.

35
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Tomorrow, the sword will be ready to be used.

36
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Wang Quan Hongye,

37
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
you've repeated what you've imagined.

38
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
The more important it is,

39
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
the more careless you are.

40
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Father,

41
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
you can't be careless.

42
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Father,

43
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
just put your heart in your stomach.

44
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
This sword is made of the divine bird and the demon elixir.

45
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
The demon fire is very powerful.

46
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Once it's out of the furnace,

47
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
it will kill the gods and the gods.

48
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Even if Wang Quan Hongye can really use the sword,

49
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
we are not afraid of him.

50
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Besides,

51
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
we still have the Eastern Fire.

52
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
There's nothing to lose.

53
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Indeed.

54
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
If it wasn't for the Eastern Fire,

55
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
the sword furnace would have been destroyed.

56
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But once the Black Shadow Formation is destroyed,

57
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
you'll be the one to guard the sword furnace.

58
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Yes.

59
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Make sure that Wang Quan Hongye

60
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
has more people.

61
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
There must be no more accidents.

62
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yes.

63
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'll go.

64
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You've been drinking all the way.

65
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
What?

66
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You're drunk.

67
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You're really angry.

68
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You're thinking about leaving me to save Anan.

69
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
How sure are you?

70
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You only want to save Anan.

71
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You don't want to save other demons.

72
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Can I have a glass of water?

73
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Thank you, Miss Huizhu,

74
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
for choosing me outside the sword furnace.

75
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm sorry.

76
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm sorry.

77
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'm sorry.

79
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm sorry.

80
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm sorry.

81
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Are you sure you can save all demons,

82
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
including Anan?

83
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
There's nothing perfect in this world.

84
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
But if you're willing to heal me,

85
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm more sure.

86
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Why do you have to finish the sword?

87
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Why don't you let me save Anan?

88
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Even if you risk your life to save Anan,

89
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
as long as the demon elixir is not enough,

90
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
there will be countless Anans

91
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
who will die in the sword furnace of the Shi family.

92
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I've been studying the formation.

93
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
The Chansi family's spirit

94
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
was a magical bell used by the Nan Chui and Zhu demons.

95
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Today, the night banquet was arranged

96
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
by the Nan Gong family's formation

97
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
into a Yin Formation.

98
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's the same as the Xue Yin Formation outside the sword furnace.

99
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
This Yin Formation is the four main elixirs

100
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
that Nan Gong Ye has been using

101
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
to restore the Yin Formation.

102
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
The reason why it only hurts you

103
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
is that you've been working hard on your position.

104
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
From the morning,

105
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
the Yin Bells are reflected in the wind

106
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
and are all gathered on you.

107
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Only when the four main demons are out tomorrow

108
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
and Nan Gong Ye is holding the opening ceremony,

109
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
can you reverse the Yin Bell

110
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
and let you fully recover.

111
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Can you guarantee that the Bells will be re-established tomorrow?

112
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Of course not.

113
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
However, you can be the center of the formation.

114
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
The Yin Bells will naturally gather there.

115
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I can re-establish the Bells.

116
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
After the ceremony,

117
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
you will be transferred to the front ten steps.

118
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Front ten steps?

119
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
That's the situation.

120
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
The opening ceremony tomorrow

121
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
is the only chance for me to heal you.

122
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
What did Nan Gong Ye promise you?

123
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Can you tell me?

124
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
If I can help you win,

125
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
please help me save a criminal from the Jicha Temple.

126
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Sure.

127
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
If you don't ask me, who is the criminal?

128
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You've done your best to save him.

129
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
He's definitely not a bad person.

130
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Thank you, Young Master Wang Quan.

131
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's getting late.

132
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You have a bad battle tomorrow.

133
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Go to sleep.

134
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
The Bells

135
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Young Master, you're awake.

136
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
This night,

137
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
you fell asleep.

138
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You must be feeling a bit ill.

139
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You're observing me.

140
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You're attacking me.

141
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm really impressed.

142
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Actually, I haven't slept all night.

143
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Why?

144
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Young Master, you're planning a plot.

145
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'm just worried that

146
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
if I can heal your wound,

147
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I will lose all my powers.

148
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So you're afraid that I will be too cruel?

149
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You're afraid that I will be too cruel?

150
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I have a suggestion.

151
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You can feed me a poison pill.

152
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Young Master, you have a good idea.

153
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
This is a poison pill.

154
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Please, Young Master.

155
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
What a coincidence.

156
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Compared to the promise,

157
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I trust him more.

158
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Young Master, you're sharp.

159
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Compared to mutual suspicion,

160
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I trust you more.

161
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
The Big Brother has broken the Bells.

162
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Now it's our turn.

163
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Remember that habits we like to remember.

164
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Well...

165
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Come on, we forced you into a ISIL.

166
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Pretty neat.

167
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
What's wrong?

168
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:51,880
Ok.

169
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Miss Wang Quan, are you here to drink with me this morning?

170
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Next time you speak out your wild words, think about it.

171
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Whether anyone's advantage can be taken.

172
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You're really disobedient.

173
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
She has used up half of her power.

174
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Even her mind is not clear.

175
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
The demon sword will be cast soon.

176
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
The demon elixir is cast.

177
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
The demon energy is low.

178
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
The Li family's Diling treasure is used to purify the energy.

179
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It's planted at the bottom of the furnace.

180
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
According to what the fourth brother said,

181
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
the demon energy is not enough to purify the energy.

182
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It's done.

183
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
The sword will be cast soon.

184
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
The one that the Nangong family has in hand

185
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
will be a blood sword full of energy.

186
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
A'Zui,

187
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm going to the temple.

188
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'll be back soon.

189
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'll be back soon.

190
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'll be back soon.

191
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I'll be back soon.

192
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'll be back soon.

193
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'll be back soon.

194
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I'll be back soon.

195
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
A'Zui,

196
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
go fix their memories.

197
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'll break the spell.

198
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Okay.

199
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Brother Yi!

200
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You have the Heaven's Eye.

201
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You must know that the demon fire will be back.

202
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
That's why you set me free.

203
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Suoxin saved her life.

204
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I'm fine.

205
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Go fix their memories.

206
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Okay, I'll go.

207
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I'll go.

208
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
From now on,

209
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
read all the books with me.

210
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Today, the sword city,

211
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Anan can't bear the pain.

212
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
She will die in the furnace.

213
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Today, the sword city,

214
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Anan can't bear the pain.

215
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
She will die in the furnace.

216
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Good girl.

217
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I think all the families

218
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
have been in the same boat with Nangong.

219
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Are you sure you can suppress Nangong

220
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
and save all the demons who are trained in swords?

221
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Change the topic.

222
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Change the topic.

223
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
That's right.

224
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Let's talk about

225
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
the poison you just took.

226
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It's very strong.

227
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
As time goes by,

228
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
your blood will be solidified in the blood vessels.

229
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
If there's no antidote...

230
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
It will be...

231
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
very bad.

232
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
The body is like a blue crystal.

233
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
It's pretty.

234
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I got it.

235
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
We...

236
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
will meet again.

237
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
The demon really died in the furnace?

238
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
That's right.

239
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Today, the sword city,

240
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Anan can't bear the pain.

241
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
She will die in the furnace.

242
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Why does my leg hurt so much?

243
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It's like I've been hit.

244
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Young master, the auspicious time is approaching.

245
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Can you please tell the master?

246
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Tell the master

247
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
that the heavenly sword has been made.

248
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
The auspicious time has come.

249
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
The auspicious time has come.

250
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Yes.

251
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
The four demon swords have been made.

252
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Please open the sword.

253
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Please.

254
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
You're not talented.

255
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
According to your master's skill,

256
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I've prepared a sword for you.

257
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
The ones who can practice sword

258
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
are demons over a hundred years old.

259
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Please taste it.

260
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Good sword.

261
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Good sword.

262
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Good sword.

263
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Good sword.

264
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Master Cheng's sword

265
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
is made by the demon of the demon king.

266
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
The sword is strong.

267
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
This sword

268
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
has been made for a hundred years.

269
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Master Nangong,

270
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I admire you.

271
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Young master Wangqun,

272
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
do you have anything to say?

273
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Since the beginning,

274
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
the sword is the master.

275
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
The sword

276
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
is the sword.

277
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
What do you mean?

278
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
What else can I mean?

279
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
The ancient sword house

280
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
is not as good as the one in Nangong's house.

281
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
What can you do

282
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
if you don't like my sword?

283
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
There is only one sword in your house.

284
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
But in Nangong's house,

285
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
there are many demon swords.

286
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
As long as the demon doesn't die,

287
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
there will be more.

288
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Quan'er is rude.

289
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
But he is not a good man.

290
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Master Nangong,

291
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
what do you mean?

292
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
With the help of the east fire,

293
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I will definitely protect the god.

294
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I have one more thing to say.

295
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I will destroy the god's sword.

296
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Please enjoy.

297
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
The sword challenge the leader.

298
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Master Nangong,

299
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
is that what you mean?

300
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Master Ran?

301
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Then you should take your Nangong's flag

302
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
and go to the general meeting of the Yiqi Alliance

303
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Wangqun mountain villa to ask for a sword.

304
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
The challenge of the leader is to kill the god.

305
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
This is the rule of the Yiqi Alliance.

306
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Since there is a change of opinion,

307
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
why should I seek for the old one?

308
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
The Yiqi Alliance's general meeting

309
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
can also be a great success for Nangong.

310
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
My dear masters,

311
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I will take my leave.

312
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I will go to the general meeting.

313
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I will go to the general meeting.

314
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
You are all welcome.

315
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
What do you think?

316
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Today, I, Nangong Ye,

317
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
will take a sword and challenge the leader of Wangqun.

318
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
This is a dangerous battle.

319
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
It is a life-threatening battle.

320
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Young master Wangqun,

321
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
do you dare to fight?

322
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
If you don't dare to fight,

323
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
you will cut your sword.

324
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
After the battle,

325
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
turn right five steps.

326
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Turn right ten steps.

327
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Young master Wangqun,

328
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
do you dare to fight?

329
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I want to ask you, Wangqun.

330
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
It depends on whether you have the ability.

331
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
This Wangqun sword is not good.

332
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
This Yiqi Alliance belongs to Nangong's family.

333
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Young master Wangqun,

334
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
you have no eyes for swords.

335
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
If you admit defeat now,

336
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
you will be able to cut the sword.

337
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Samourai CPU

338
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,400

You broke the formation and saved him.

350
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,520
I'm your only opponent.

351
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:22,520
Ten years ago, I lost to Wang Quan.

352
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,520
It was because I was not cruel enough.

353
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:32,520
Today, I will never lose to this little boy again.

354
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,520
Something's wrong.

355
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:47,520
I am the strongest in the world.

356
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:02,520
You can't stop me.

357
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,520
Father!

358
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,520
Even my son is hurt!

359
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,520
The evil spirit of the God of War is really a counter-attack!

360
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,520
Go! Go!

361
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,520
Enough!

The God of War

363
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:06,520
The God of War

364
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,520
Miss Xie, use the God's fire to free them.

365
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:36,520
The God of War

366
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,520
The love and hate will last forever.

367
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:55,520
None of you can escape.

368
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,520
The love and hate will last forever.

369
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,520
Hongye, remember my words.

370
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,520
Stop the fight between the evil spirit and the god.

371
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,520
Stop the coming of the eternal night.

372
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:34,520
The God of War

373
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,520
Congratulations, young master.

374
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,520
Leave the rest to you.

375
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,520
Yes.

376
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:05,520
The God of War

377
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:34,520
The God of War

378
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,520
Young master Wang Quan.

379
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,520
Miss Huizhu.

380
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,520
I asked you to come here because I want to tell you that Anan has been rescued.

381
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,520
I have visited the mountain of Tu.

382
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,520
There is a monster tribe there.

383
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,520
They are specializing in the homeless.

384
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:52,520
If so, I have some saved monsters for Anan.

385
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,520
Thank you, young master Wang Quan.

386
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,520
In general, young 찬 autorities are started, but human beings stay here.

387
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,520
Young master, when Time sacrifice the Heaven,

388
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,520
thewithering of the river bottom is done.

389
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,520
Switch from duck to cloud, into human,

390
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,520
off topic.

391
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:09,520
You reasoned that I wasn't good?

392
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:14,520
Even if this treasureder is hit by the water all over the world,

393
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:18,520
he cannot be launched with anything bad.

394
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,520
I see.

395
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,520
You mean

396
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:25,520
But we're not on the same path.

397
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,720
What do you think about what Young Master said

398
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,720
before he died?

399
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,920
Young Master.

400
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:48,520
The person you're looking for is indeed in the Bureau.

401
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,520
The Bureau is independent of the Yiqi Alliance.

402
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,520
Do you intend to save the person

403
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,520
by yourself?

404
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,520
Let's go.

405
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:26,520
The Bureau is independent of the Yiqi Alliance.

406
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:30,520
The Bureau is independent of the Yiqi Alliance.

407
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:34,520
The Bureau is independent of the Yiqi Alliance.

408
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:38,520
The Bureau is independent of the Yiqi Alliance.

409
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:42,520
The Bureau is independent of the Yiqi Alliance.

410
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:46,520
The Bureau is independent of the Yiqi Alliance.

411
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:50,520
The Bureau is independent of the Yiqi Alliance.

412
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,520
Who is it?

413
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,520
Mu Xiaowu.

414
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:58,520
This is the release document of the Yiqi Alliance.

415
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,520
Who is Mu Xiaowu?

416
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,520
His real name is Mu Renzhi.

417
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,520
He's ranked fifth in the family.

418
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,520
So everyone calls him Mu Xiaowu.

419
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,520
What's wrong with the document?

420
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,520
You have a document, you should follow the rules of the Bureau.

421
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,520
Let's calculate it for him.

422
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,520
How long have you been here?

423
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:21,520
It's been less than half a month.

424
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,520
It's hard to say.

425
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,520
You have a lot of work.

426
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,520
The starting price of the prison is 300 taels.

427
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,520
The daily expenses are 2.2 taels.

428
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,520
You've been here for 15 days.

429
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,520
15 days is...

430
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,520
35...

431
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:39,520
And the last one is the inspection fee.

432
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,520
It's 7, 7, 8, 8, 4, 5, 5.

433
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,520
The last one is 4.2 million.

434
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,520
Wait until you're done with the inspection fee.

435
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,520
You'll be here for 10 days.

436
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,520
There's a discount for the prison?

437
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:56,520
Why don't you spend your money on food and drinks?

438
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,520
Why do you need to be here for 10 days?

439
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,520
Why?

440
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,520
There are so many people here.

441
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,520
You don't need to examine the cases.

442
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,520
You don't need to check them.

443
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,520
If you make a mistake, you'll be responsible for it.

444
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,520
You can't be here for 10 days.

445
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:13,520
If you make a mistake, you'll be responsible for it.

446
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,520
You'll be responsible for it.

447
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,520
Stop talking nonsense.

448
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,520
Give me the money.

449
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:22,520
Miss A'Zhu, what do you think we should do?

450
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,520
Young Master, we're in a hurry.

451
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,520
We don't have much money.

452
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:32,520
Why don't we use your sword to fight?

453
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,520
Why are you fighting here?

454
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:43,520
You're holding a sword like a 400-pound sword.

455
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,520
You think you can...

456
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,520
Wang Quan Sword?

457
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,520
Young Master, aren't we in the Nangong River?

458
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,520
I have good news.

459
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,520
You can use the sword to fight against Nangong Ye.

460
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:05,520
You'll have a chance to make a difference.

461
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,520
You'll have a chance to make a difference.

462
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,520
I'm sorry.

463
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:19,520
I want to see Mu Xiaowu in ten trees.

464
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,520
Otherwise...

465
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,520
A'Yan.

466
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,520
A'Yan!

467
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,520
Xiaowu!

468
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,520
How are you?

469
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:46,520
It's a family thing to have a lover who is loyal to you.

470
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:49,520
You're still a young man.

471
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:54,520
You're a great man.

472
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:58,520
You're a normal person like Mu Xiaowu.

473
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:04,520
People think that you should fight for something.

474
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,520
I've brought out the person you want.

475
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,520
Now you can help me.

476
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,520
Don't worry.

477
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,520
Really?

478
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,520
Really?

479
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,520
That's great, A'Yan!

480
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,520
We have a child!

481
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,520
We really have a child!

482
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,520
Be careful!

483
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,520
As you said,

484
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,520
I don't think

485
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:36,520
I can let Mu Xiaowu be taken away by the Yang family.

486
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:46,520
You want me to protect Mu Xiaowu?

487
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,520
Yes, I hope you can do that.

488
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,520
How much do I have to do?

489
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,520
I can't keep them for the rest of my life.

490
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,520
I'd better get them married within a month.

491
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,520
I'll detoxify the young master.

492
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,520
So fast?

493
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,520
Night is long and dreams are many.

494
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:07,520
I owe this favor to the young master.

495
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:15,520
This friend is so important to you.

496
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,520
The core of life is to have a friend.

497
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:23,520
A'Yan's being in your arms is a part of life.

498
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,520
Miss Huachu.

499
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,520
Go back and wait for the news.

500
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,520
I'll wait for the news.

501
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,520
Take care, young master.

502
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,520
I bet my life is cheated on!

503
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:21,340
I wouldn't

504
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,620
I hate death.

505
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:25,780
It will get stronger and stronger.

506
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,140
Not enough.

507
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:28,740
Not enough.

508
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,060
People are good,

509
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,580
demons are bad.

510
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,340
I want this world to be full of creativity,

511
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,220
hatred and despair.

512
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,540
They are the source of my power.

513
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,260
This world is very long.

514
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,660
I will definitely return to the circle.

515
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:00,860
Darkness will devour everything.

516
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:24,100
The world is very long.

517
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,620
I will definitely return to the circle.

518
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:29,020
Darkness will devour everything.

519
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,460
I will definitely return to the circle.

520
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,900
Darkness will devour everything.

521
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,300
I will definitely return to the circle.

522
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,860
Darkness will devour everything.

523
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,500
I will definitely return to the circle.

524
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:44,060
Darkness will devour everything.

525
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,620
I will definitely return to the circle.

526
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:49,060
Darkness will devour everything.

527
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:51,580
Darkness will devour everything.

528
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,820
Darkness will devour everything.

529
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:56,060
Darkness will devour everything.

530
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,300
Darkness will devour everything.

531
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,540
Darkness will devour everything.

532
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,780
Darkness will devour everything.

533
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:05,020
Darkness will devour everything.

534
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:07,260
Darkness will devour everything.

535
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,500
Darkness will devour everything.

536
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:11,740
Darkness will devour everything.

537
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:13,980
Darkness will devour everything.

538
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,220
Darkness will devour everything.

539
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:18,460
Darkness will devour everything.

540
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:20,620
Darkness will devour everything.

541
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:22,860
Darkness will destroy everything.

542
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:25,100
Darkness will destroy everything.

543
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:27,340
Darkness will devour everything.

544
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:29,580
Darkness will devour everything.

545
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,820
Darkness will devour everything.

546
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:35,180
Darkness, my constant fear…

547
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,460
Darkness…

548
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,780
No understanding…

549
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:42,020
Darkness's both past and future.

550
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:44,340
Darkness, my constant fear…

551
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:46,860
Darkness why so hostile?
