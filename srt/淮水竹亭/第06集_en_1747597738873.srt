00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Episode 15

2
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The important information of the King of Yi is here.

3
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
As you expected,

4
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
the master of Nangong is dead, but his power is still here.

5
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Nangong Chui is on his way to the Jichasi.

6
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
He has transferred all the information of Mu Xiaowu.

7
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Let him come.

8
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I hope he can be as stupid as possible

9
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
and help me get rid of the nail of Jichasi.

10
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I knew it.

11
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You wouldn't come just to attend the Yang family's wedding.

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
This is also the place he hates me.

13
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Him?

14
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The one downstairs today is the Miss Dongfang.

15
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So this play is for him?

16
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It doesn't matter if the play is ruined.

17
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Anyway, it's all for Miss Wang Quan.

18
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
That's all.

19
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Thank you.

20
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'll go pack the jewelry.

21
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Miss, please wait.

22
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
This one looks good.

23
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's so beautiful.

24
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's really beautiful.

25
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Do you like it?

26
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Yes.

27
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'll buy it for you.

28
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Thank you, Miss.

29
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'll bring it for you.

30
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's so beautiful.

31
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I like it.

32
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I must make her my sister-in-law.

33
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
What kind of tricks are you using?

34
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Don't be so perfect.

35
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Qin Lan.

36
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You can try it.

37
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Okay.

38
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Miss, please enjoy.

39
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The biggest restaurant in the city is called Yunjing Restaurant.

40
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
The owner will stop you.

41
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
He'll say that today is the New Year.

42
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
There are two people who are going to drink.

43
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
They'll see the money of the two immortals and the heavenly gift box.

44
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
They'll be willing to offer it for free.

45
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Chen Pangzi is not a good person.

46
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
He took a few hundred taels for this.

47
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
He can't return the money.

48
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
But someone did something bad.

49
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
If you can talk about it,

50
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
it's not a bad thing.

51
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'll go.

52
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Chen,

53
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
can you give the jewelry back to Sister Yan?

54
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
She agreed.

55
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You're really a great girl.

56
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm sorry to bother you today.

57
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Please forgive me.

58
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'll offer this wine to the young master of Wangquan.

59
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Thank you for helping me.

60
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I hope my Yan will be happy.

61
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Thank you.

62
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Thank you.

63
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Thank you.

64
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Thank you.

65
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Thank you.

66
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Thank you.

67
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Thank you.

68
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I hope Yan will be happy.

69
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'd like to thank you for the second glass of wine.

70
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Why is it the second glass?

71
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's hard to get what you want.

72
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm sure that the young lady and her sister

73
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
will not be able to afford it.

74
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Of course,

75
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
it's all thanks to the young master of Wangquan.

76
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Miss Hua Zhu,

77
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
since you came here,

78
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
don't let the stars down.

79
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
If you really want to thank me,

80
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
we'll drink the third glass slowly.

81
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Miss Hua Zhu,

82
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
why do you like star-gazing?

83
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Because there is a story between me and my family.

84
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
A family story?

85
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Sweet omen,

86
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
endless words,

87
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
and the starry sky

88
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
that can only recognize its own star.

89
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Where is the star that belongs to you?

90
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's still in the sky.

91
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
But I'm sure

92
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
that star must be it.

93
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
The evening breeze is soft

94
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Drinking the sunset like a dream

95
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Hua Zhu,

96
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
actually I...

97
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Young master of Wangquan,

98
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
the third glass of wine

99
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
will be enough for us.

100
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
If there is anything that you need,

101
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
you can tell me.

102
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
As for the rest,

103
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I have no plans.

104
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Goodbye.

105
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Goodbye.

106
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000

Let's raise our pancakes

112
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So wnazap

113
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000

The cabbage

116
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So wnazap

117
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'm sorry.

118
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It's okay.

119
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
We'll go to see your sister.

120
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
But, sister,

121
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,000
did something happen between you and Wang Quan yesterday?

122
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
What happened?

123
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
What?

124
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
He knows that sister loves ointment the most.

125
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
What does sister like about that young master Wang Ba?

126
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Why waste time on empty flowers?

127
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
His surname is Wang Quan, not Wang Ba.

128
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Brother!

129
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Brother, the moon was bright last night.

130
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
What do you think will happen between you two?

131
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
What do you think will happen between us?

132
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
What are you doing?

133
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
There's no ointment.

134
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It means that you haven't been in touch.

135
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Brother, you haven't had enough?

136
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I have something to tell you.

137
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Don't ask me.

138
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I want to ask you two.

139
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Do you have anything to tell me?

140
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Brother, the...

141
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Okay, okay.

142
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You don't need to take the responsibility today.

143
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I came up with the idea.

144
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I took the wrong ointment.

145
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
At least, you can scold me.

146
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm not allowed to take the responsibility.

147
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'm not afraid.

148
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I can go to the hospital.

149
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I can go to the hospital.

150
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I can go to the hospital.

151
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Everyone is looking at me.

152
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I can sneak out.

153
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Actually, it's not the first time.

154
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Thank you.

155
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
So, there's a fire?

156
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Right?

157
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Yes.

158
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It's not going to work.

159
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
The fire is too big.

160
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's all burnt.

161
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It's okay.

162
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It's okay to eat hard.

163
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
We all like this sister-in-law.

164
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Don't be angry.

165
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Okay.

166
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Today is the wedding.

167
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Some families may not be at ease.

168
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
We should prepare.

169
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
As for other things,

170
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
let's just do it naturally.

171
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Okay.

172
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
How can we do it naturally?

173
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
We should take the opportunity to take the first step.

174
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Okay, let's go.

175
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I haven't finished yet.

176
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'll think of another plan for you.

177
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Where are we going next time?

178
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
No.

179
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Let's go.

180
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Brother, you can't give up.

181
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Come on.

182
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Why are you pulling me?

183
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Yesterday, A-Zui bought it for you.

184
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Even if the flowers bloom,

185
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
you will still lose your sense of taste.

186
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
When you think it's right,

187
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
give it to her.

188
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Okay.

189
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
My A Yan is so beautiful.

190
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Is my waist a little thick?

191
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
It's still early to get up.

192
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Don't worry.

193
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
A Zhu,

194
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I have today.

195
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Thanks to you,

196
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I don't have such a big ability.

197
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
If it weren't for you,

198
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I wouldn't have been able to get in.

199
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm sorry.

200
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Miss,

201
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
the groom's wedding is coming soon.

202
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
It will be here soon.

203
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
You can be your bride this morning.

204
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Everything is important.

205
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Mu Jialan is inviting the family of Yang to the Yang Hu.

206
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
To make peace,

207
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
to think what you want,

208
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
to fulfill your wishes,

209
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
and to treat your wife as the heaven.

210
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
The wedding is coming soon.

211
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
The bride is leaving the wedding.

212
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Good!

213
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Good!

214
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Good!

215
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Good!

216
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Good!

217
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Good!

218
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I didn't expect that Wang Quan

219
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
to be the groom's soldier.

220
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
The groom is coming!

221
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Why can't I get down from the sedan chair?

222
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
That's right.

223
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'm fine.

224
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Coming!

225
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I haven't seen it yet.

226
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
The Yang family is deliberately lost.

227
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I'm sorry.

228
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm not good enough.

229
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
The wedding!

230
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Please!

231
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Good!

232
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
The bride is coming!

233
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Good!

234
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Good!

235
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Good!

236
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I was Legal Co-Yes.

237
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Oh!

238
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Hello, congratulations!

239
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Wait!

240
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Sit!

241
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
世界!

242
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Well done!

243
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
The finish line!

244
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
The finish line!

245
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
passed!

246
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
After the wrestling ring,

247
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,500
the winner will become the second- chlorine!

248
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
The first medal will beame the very first medal!

249
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Well done!

250
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,000
Listen!

251
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,800
You're really a manly and pretty man.

252
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,600
However,

253
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,420
Adam Brandt always

254
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,260
borders things from the rear

255
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,300
You can buy anything you want on the retail market door.

256
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,060
If I were a man,

257
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,580
I want to cook in high quality.

258
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,100
So then I could buy you a molecular

259
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:53,720
baix somewhat stronger

260
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,000
smells

261
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:06,040
to my native country.

262
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,800
My mother brought me to what

263
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:13,640
is now Black venture,

264
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,360
White workshop.

265
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,480
We are ...

266
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,560
Jurassic Continent

267
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,400
the bride and the groom

268
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,080
So claro

269
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,640
Chemistry of Sovietweight

270
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,580
I only wish pretend that we live in the same world,

271
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,780
So that we would never die forever.

272
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:04,040
But do you know what it is about?

273
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,820
But the only thing we do and nothing will happen to us anymore

274
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:11,560
Will I only wish there is love for you?

275
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,740
That fate ends where we stand.

276
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,540
Be acostum Assistance

277
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:22,840
Let me say

278
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,140
Sir!

279
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:28,940
Is Li Cheng a husband of yours?

280
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,180
Simple

281
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,380
Li Cheng, husband

282
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,580
Ohh

283
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,080
Who are you?

284
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,580
I'm her father.

285
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,080
Do you know his family name?

286
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,380
No!

287
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,580
Her father worked here.

288
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,180
Really?

289
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,580
Yes.

290
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,600
What?

291
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,580
You said you knew him.

292
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,380
But, did he tell you?

293
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,580
Yes.

294
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,380
He agriculture bank owner,

295
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,380
What's going on?

296
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,380
What's going on?

297
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:25,380
Master Yang, you need to think twice before drinking this cup of tea.

298
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,380
Yan'er.

299
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,380
Yan'er.

300
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:41,380
Master of the Nankong family is so agitated.

301
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,380
What do you mean?

302
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:46,380
I'm so agitated.

303
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,380
Of course, I'm not here to drink,

304
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:52,380
but to take someone.

305
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:57,380
Young Master Wang Quan is here too.

306
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,380
Young Master Wang Quan,

307
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:04,380
guess who I'm going to take today?

308
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:08,380
On the day of the wedding, you're so agitated

309
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:11,380
to take on the Yang family.

310
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,380
On the contrary,

311
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:19,380
I'm here to save the Yang family.

312
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,380
Since you want to work,

313
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,380
let's work together.

314
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:28,380
Yitan, take the two newbies to rest.

315
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,380
Wait!

316
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,380
Young Master Wang Quan,

317
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,380
I'm really sorry.

318
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:41,380
The one I'm going to take today is the murderer

319
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:45,380
and the groom, Mu Ren Zhi.

320
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,380
Nankong Chui,

321
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:54,380
do you have any evidence that Mu Ren Zhi is the murderer?

322
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:59,380
The spirit demon that Mu Ren Zhi released

323
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,380
killed someone.

324
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:04,380
It was in broad daylight.

325
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,380
Nonsense!

326
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,380
He was very gentle.

327
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,380
He would never kill someone.

328
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,380
Listen, everyone.

329
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:18,380
The court is open for the demon.

330
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:21,380
What is the real murderer?

331
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,380
Since he killed someone,

332
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,380
where is the murderer?

333
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,380
I'll take him here.

334
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,380
The murderer is running away.

335
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,380
Then why did you say he was a accomplice?

336
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,380
If it wasn't for Mu Xiaowu releasing the spirit demon,

337
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,380
the spirit demon wouldn't have been in trouble and wouldn't have died.

338
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,380
If you're saying nothing,

339
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:44,380
I'll take it as your abuse of power.

340
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,380
Young Master Wang Quan,

341
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:49,380
I want to describe the scene.

342
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,380
He killed someone!

343
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,380
He killed someone!

344
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:59,380
He killed someone!

345
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,380
Young Master Wang Quan,

346
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:10,380
I know you saved Mu Xiaowu from prison.

347
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,380
But so many things happened.

348
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,380
You think you can't say anything

349
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,380
if you're just a spy?

350
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,380
Since you're doubting me,

351
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,380
it means you're prepared.

352
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:23,380
This is the content of the Yiqi Alliance.

353
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,380
You can leave now.

354
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:29,380
I want to talk to the police.

355
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,380
Let's go.

356
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,380
Hurry up.

357
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:43,380
Detective Yi, take the two newbies to rest.

358
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,380
Okay.

359
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,380
Young Master Wang Quan,

360
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,380
the spirit demon is cunning.

361
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,380
He can't find a trace.

362
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,380
If you insist on asking for the medicine,

363
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:56,380
it'll be hard to get him.

364
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:59,380
The police can't tell the difference between the white and the red.

365
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,380
It's not easy to catch him.

366
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,380
You're right.

367
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,380
I'm not a spy.

368
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,380
I'm just a spy.

369
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,380
I'm just a spy.

370
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,380
I'm just a spy.

371
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,380
I'm just a spy.

372
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,380
You're not going to take the man?

373
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,380
You're not going to take the man?

374
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,380
If the police can't catch the killer,

375
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,380
should I let Mu Xiaowu

376
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,380
be the spy forever?

377
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,380
be the spy forever?

378
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,380
I'll catch the killer myself.

379
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,380
I'll catch the killer myself.

380
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,380
Before I come back,

381
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,380
I won't touch the Yang family's name.

382
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:35,380
I won't touch the Yang family's name.

383
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,380
I won't touch the Yang family's name.

384
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,380
Young Master,

385
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:41,380
why do you think

386
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,380
I'm a spy?

387
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,380
Why do you think I'm a spy?

388
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,380
If you keep nagging,

389
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:53,380
I'll lose my patience.

390
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,380
Okay.

391
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,380
I'll wait for you

392
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:59,380
to come back.

393
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,380
I believe in A Yan.

394
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,380
The spirit monster was right.

395
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,380
The investigation of the police

396
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,380
is against me and the Yang family.

397
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,380
The one who is behind this is definitely Nangong Chui.

398
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,380
Brother.

399
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,380
Yitan, I'll bring the witness back.

400
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,380
Before I come back,

401
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,380
you must protect everyone.

402
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,380
Don't hand over Mu Xiaowu.

403
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,380
I'll let A Sui stay with you.

404
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,380
If you have any questions,

405
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,380
let her talk.

406
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,380
I'll go with you.

407
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:43,380
You're the best.

408
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,380
Stay at the Yang family.

409
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,380
If anything happens,

410
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,380
the flower shop will send a message.

411
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,380
The Nangong family will not give up.

412
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,380
So?

413
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,380
Let's go.

414
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,380
Master Nangong.

415
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:13,380
How is your leg?

416
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,380
Why do you feel worse?

417
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,380
Thank you for your concern.

418
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,380
I can walk.

419
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,380
Really?

420
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,380
Did Nangong family do something bad?

421
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,380
Yes.

422
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,380
Did they do it on their own?

423
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,380
Master Nangong, sit down.

424
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,380
The king has been in good health for years.

425
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,380
My father died.

426
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,380
You don't pretend.

427
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,380
But the Yiqi Alliance

428
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,380
is not your family's.

429
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,380
Right?

430
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:07,380
I want to know,

431
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,380
which family is so unpopular?

432
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,380
Don't talk to me.

433
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,380
You're smart.

434
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,380
But your leg is not changing.

435
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,380
Are you going to wait for my brother here?

436
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,380
Yes.

437
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,380
Master Nangong,

438
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,380
you should go back to the police.

439
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,380
You saw it.

440
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,380
Today is a big day.

441
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,380
The Yang family can't be too shameless.

442
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,380
Master Yang,

443
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,380
don't marry your daughter to a useless man.

444
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:39,380
I suggest that we should

445
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,380
take the staff of the Mu family

446
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,380
back to the police.

447
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,380
After the red night of the Wangquan,

448
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,380
we will deal with them together.

449
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:49,380
But you said it just now.

450
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,380
The Yiqi Alliance is united.

451
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,380
They won't wrong a good man.

452
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,380
Master Yang,

453
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,380
you can't just

454
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,380
destroy the police

455
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,380
and the police.

456
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,380
Although Wangquan is strong,

457
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:07,380
the Yang family

458
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,380
can't just stand by and watch.

459
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,380
If I hand over the staff,

460
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:19,380
can you guarantee fair treatment?

461
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,380
Of course.

462
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:29,380
Guards!

463
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,380
Wait!

464
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,380
Today, many things happened in the Yang family.

465
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,380
My grandfather is very tired.

466
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,380
He needs to rest.

467
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:41,380
Send the guest.

468
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:43,380
Master, master.

469
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,380
Yang Huanzhou, who is the master of the Yang family?

470
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,380
Where is he?

471
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:49,380
Here.

472
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,380
Send the guest.

473
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:53,380
Master Yang,

474
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,380
think twice.

475
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,380
Yang Li.

476
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,380
Send the master of the Nangong family away.

477
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,380
Master Nangong, please.

478
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,380
Yang Yitan,

479
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:23,380
think clearly.

480
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,380
Who are you talking to?

481
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,380
Master Nangong,

482
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:31,380
don't force me to do anything.

483
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,380
Master, master.

484
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,380
Help me up.

485
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,380
Listen carefully.

486
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,380
If I step out of this door today,

487
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:13,380
the Yang family will never have a chance.

488
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,380
You can choose

489
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,380
whether to stay or stay.

490
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:19,380
I, Wangquan,

491
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:21,380
am always the most lawless.

492
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,380
I'm not a criminal.

493
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,380
I'm a man of my word.

494
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,380
I, Wangquan,

495
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:29,380
am always the most lawless.

496
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,380
I'm not as easy as the Yang family.

497
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,380
Get out.

498
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,380
Go.

499
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,380
You are so unreasonable.

500
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,380
Even a Yang family

501
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,380
dares to be rude to our Nangong family.

502
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,380
There are still a few mines in the Yang family.

503
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,380
Master,

504
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,380
send someone to find some oil.

505
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:59,380
Today, seal all these mines.

506
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:01,380
Yes.

507
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,380
Master,

508
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:07,380
no matter what,

509
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:09,380
the Yang family is not a threat.

510
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:11,380
The most important thing now is

511
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,380
to never let Wangquan find that little demon.

512
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,380
It's not easy.

513
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,380
He has already been killed on the street.

514
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,380
The iron is like a mountain.

515
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,380
Just kill him.

516
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,380
Master,

517
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,380
that little demon took my jade seal.

518
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:29,380
He has escaped from Wu Zong.

519
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:31,380
But, master, don't worry.

520
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,380
We can't let Wangquan

521
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:35,380
find that little demon sooner.

522
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:37,380
Get out.

523
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,380
Let's put two more.

524
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:47,380
And...

525
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:49,380
Let's put three more.

526
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,380
Young master Wangquan.

527
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:53,380
Young master Wangquan.

528
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,380
What are you buying today?

529
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,380
News.

530
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,380
With Miss Huizhu.

531
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,380
Follow me.

532
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:23,380
Miss Huizhu,

533
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,380
do you know

534
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,380
the Ruyi building?

535
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,380
Of course.

536
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,380
The Qingmu family's building

537
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,380
is the world's largest.

538
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:35,380
It's a network of information.

539
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:37,380
Each building

540
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:39,380
is one of the information points.

541
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,380
Miss Dongfang,

542
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:43,380
have you seen the real Ruyi building?

543
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,380
I've seen it.

544
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,380
I've seen it.

545
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,380
I've seen it.

546
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,380
Okay.

547
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,380
Here.

548
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:59,380
Okay.

549
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,380
Okay.

550
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,380
Okay.

551
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,380
Okay.

552
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,380
Okay.

553
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,380
Miss Dongfang,

554
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,380
please.

555
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,380
I guess

556
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,380
all the eight branches of the Qingmu family

557
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:01,380
have this water table.

558
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,380
I think it's the right word.

559
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,380
You're right.

560
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:07,380
How long will it take?

561
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,380
Young master Wangquan,

562
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,380
if you want to add money,

563
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:13,380
you need to add money.

564
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:15,380
Boss Qingmu.

565
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:23,380
The prefect of Suzhou

566
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,380
was a major criminal.

567
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:29,380
He's the one you're looking for?

568
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:31,380
I heard that this monster is kind.

569
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:33,380
He's good at killing.

570
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:35,380
