00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Love by Hypnotic

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,040
The love is burning

3
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:11,720
The tears are like the wind, the sky is like the wind

4
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,760
Don't turn back, keep going, life and death are in front of you

5
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:25,080
From the fire to the fire, whose love will light up the world?

6
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,160
Don't turn back, keep going, life and death are in front of you

7
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:38,520
From the fire to the fire, whose love will light up the world?

8
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,520
It's you and me

9
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,200
The Love by Hypnotic

10
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,360
Vixelaman, a big mouthful of singing and drinking

11
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,000
Maidong wants you to watch the water-burning bamboo grove

12
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:04,160
The Love by Hypnotic

13
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,160
Stop! Don't run!

14
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,160
Stop!

15
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,160
Stop!

16
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,160
Why are you running?

17
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,160
Please, let me go. I don't want to go into the environment.

18
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,160
I saw people who went into the environment died in a terrible way.

19
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,160
Please, let me go. I don't want to go into the environment.

20
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,160
You can't go in there.

21
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,160
No! Please, let me go. I don't want to go into the environment.

22
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,160
I don't want to go!

23
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,160
My lady, tonight is the night after my demon's death.

24
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,160
The first night is also the most sacred time of my demon's life.

25
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,160
You said you couldn't do it yourself.

26
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,160
You must watch over me.

27
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,160
Big Brother, no problem.

28
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,160
The night is coming.

29
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,160
Life is hard to change.

30
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,160
You can't escape the eastern bamboo.

31
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:59,160
The Love by Hypnotic

32
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,160
Is this so heavy?

33
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,160
Could it be the demon's demon heart?

34
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,160
The Love by Hypnotic

35
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,160
I didn't expect that the eastern spirit blood in my body

36
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,160
could still work like this.

37
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,160
I'm afraid that I can't go back to the capital.

38
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,160
I'm afraid that I can't go back to the capital.

39
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,160
I'm afraid that I can't go back to the capital.

40
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,160
I'm afraid that I can't go back to the capital.

41
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,160
I'm afraid that I can't go back to the capital.

42
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,160
I'm afraid that I can't go back to the capital.

43
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,160
I'm afraid that I can't go back to the capital.

44
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,160
I'm afraid that I can't go back to the capital.

45
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,160
I'm afraid that I can't go back to the capital.

46
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,160
I'm afraid that I can't go back to the capital.

47
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,160
I'm afraid that I can't go back to the capital.

48
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,160
I'm afraid that I can't go back to the capital.

49
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,160
I'm afraid that I can't go back to the capital.

50
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,160
I'm afraid that I can't go back to the capital.

51
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,160
I'm afraid that I can't go back to the capital.

52
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,160
I'm afraid that I can't go back to the capital.

53
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,160
I'm afraid that I can't go back to the capital.

54
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,160
I'm afraid that I can't go back to the capital.

55
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,740
The

56
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:24,740
The

57
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,740
Why am I in the room in my arms?

58
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,740
Yang is like crab in the mouth.

59
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,740
As expected, he is wise.

60
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,080
What's wrong?

61
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,200
Did you get a fever?

62
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,920
My Lady, you should get up.

63
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,080
You told me

64
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,440
that I must wake you up at 13 o'clock.

65
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,120
I'll sleep for a while.

66
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,080
You can wake me up later.

67
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,800
If you can't get up,

68
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,320
you can go tomorrow.

69
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,000
The anti-virus report said

70
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,160
that Zhang Zheng's family will have a bowl of wonton

71
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,160
at Zhang Ji's wonton shop

72
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,520
at dawn every day.

73
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:45,880
Get up.

74
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,680
Change your clothes.

75
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:48,800
Get up.

76
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,600
Young Master Wang Quan.

77
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,080
What are you doing

78
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,440
in my sister's room?

79
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,520
It's not what you think.

80
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,920
It's not what I think?

81
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,720
What is it?

82
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,640
So I'm that kind of person

83
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,160
in your eyes.

84
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,240
Stop talking nonsense.

85
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,480
Say it.

86
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,360
Last night,

87
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,360
I was in your sister's room.

88
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,400
That's because

89
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,040
my demon aura suddenly started to grow.

90
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,760
I can't control myself because of the cold.

91
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,160
Your sister is special.

92
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,040
I can't control myself to find her.

93
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,200
But I never did anything

94
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,480
that was unreasonable.

95
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,800
You don't believe that I can do it.

96
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,320
Don't you

97
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,560
still believe your sister?

98
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,360
I'm warning you that

99
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,920
stay away from my sister in the future.

100
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,280
Stop eating outside-door than your playing big guy.

101
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:54,840
Go borrow your rattles!

102
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,880
My Lady said

103
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,840
these are some materials of therest room.

104
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,840
Please deliver here.

105
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,480
My Lady,

106
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,600
I was wrong about you.

107
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,600
I'll send it to you.

108
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,240
Thank you.

109
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:17,960
Sister.

110
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,200
Why are you so nice to Young Master Wang Quan?

111
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,480
Last night, he was influenced by the demon.

112
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,880
He didn't do anything wrong.

113
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,480
Why didn't he go to Li Quzhuo?

114
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,440
Isn't it warmer to hug a dog?

115
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,040
He obviously wanted to come to you.

116
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,600
You're right.

117
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,440
Look.

118
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,600
I told you.

119
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,080
You don't know the face of the person.

120
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,440
Sister.

121
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,880
It's hard to change a person.

122
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,440
We can't be fooled by his sweet words.

123
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,440
Huai Zhu.

124
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,240
You dare to come again?

125
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,720
Wu Mei sent a new message.

126
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,320
Xinlan.

127
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,040
We have something to discuss.

128
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,720
Why don't you go outside to get some sun?

129
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,640
Help me close the door.

130
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,520
Thank you.

131
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,120
Wang Quan Hong Yan.

132
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,440
I will never let you get in the hospital.

133
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,520
I didn't say the person who went to the Dream House

134
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,600
spent a lot of money to buy a medicine for me in the dark.

135
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,560
It needs to be strong.

136
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,640
When will the dark room open?

137
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,880
We are already investigating.

138
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,040
Look.

139
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,520
The wontons are ready.

140
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,480
Here are the wontons.

141
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,680
Thank you, boss.

142
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,560
Enjoy your meal.

143
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,040
Boss, the wontons.

144
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,440
OK, I will have the meat part.

145
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,720
OK, hurry to come.

146
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,320
Did you take a look?

147
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,360
Look at this.

148
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,240
you should have a look a little.

149
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,160
What is the order today?

150
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,200
2kg pork and meat.

151
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,560
Please enjoy.

152
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,960
Qingmu Yuan. Qingmu Yuan.

153
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,200
Why did he have to suffer this?

154
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,040
Anyway, he hasn't arrived yet.

155
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,200
I'll take a nap.

156
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,480
What is it?

157
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,160
The last one. Here you are.

158
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,040
It's so hot.

159
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,000
It's the best when it's hot.

160
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,880
It'll get cold soon.

161
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,280
It's the last one.

162
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,760
Why don't you eat it yourself?

163
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,160
It's the last one.

164
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,520
I'm eating it with a girl.

165
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,400
My mom will beat me to death.

166
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,320
You have a good family background.

167
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:41,960
Just like me.

168
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,160
Let me ask you something.

169
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,880
Why do you hate my brother so much?

170
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,320
I don't hate your brother.

171
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,280
It's just that I have a brother-in-law.

172
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,880
He's the leader of the Masked Club.

173
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,880
So I have to protect my sister

174
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,120
for my brother-in-law.

175
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,480
The Masked Club?

176
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,840
Me? My brother?

177
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,400
You...

178
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,200
Is there something wrong with your eyes?

179
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,840
Only your eyes are wrong.

180
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,840
I'm not a bad person.

181
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,160
I'm just a bad person.

182
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,360
I'm just a bad person.

183
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,440
I'm just a bad person.

184
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,440
I'm just a bad person.

185
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,640
There's something wrong with my eyes.

186
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,560
Let me ask you again.

187
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,960
What do you think is wrong with my brother

188
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,720
and the Masked Club?

189
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,520
Young Master.

190
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,280
He's not a bad person.

191
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,720
It's just that

192
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,360
there are too many things

193
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,760
to stay in the Manor of the Fiery Mountain.

194
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,760
My sister has been working hard

195
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,760
to get by.

196
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,200
So,

197
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,480
only when I have a free and free life

198
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,400
can I give my sister a free life.

199
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,480
There's something wrong with your brain.

200
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,640
I think there's something wrong with you.

201
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,200
I feel sorry for my sister.

202
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,400
You don't understand anything.

203
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,200
Are you angry?

204
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,160
I'm not angry with the dog.

205
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,680
Don't be angry.

206
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,760
I... I was...

207
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,160
I'll make you a play.

208
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,880
Go ahead.

209
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,000
Guess.

210
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:41,920
This way.

211
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,520
Meow meow.

212
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,440
Try to meow again.

213
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,200
What's your plan today?

214
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,920
Today,

215
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,800
I have an appointment with the pharmacy boss.

216
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,840
You're going to keep collecting information?

217
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,120
Yes.

218
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,720
What about you?

219
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,960
What's your plan?

220
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,600
I'll practice the demon skill during the day

221
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,960
to see if I have any new skills.

222
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,040
Then,

223
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,440
I'll go to the pharmacy to pick you up at dusk.

224
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,040
At night,

225
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,440
we'll go to the manor of the Fiery Mountain to watch the stars.

226
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,680
But Qin Lan...

227
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,480
Don't worry.

228
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,040
I'll have Qu Zhou take care of him.

229
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,960
Who? Who?

230
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,320
Sister, I'm hungry.

231
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,160
Qin Lan,

232
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,240
what did you eat just now?

233
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,760
I'm not full.

234
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,520
I can't eat.

235
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,680
Fine.

236
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,520
Fine.

237
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,560
Let's go to eat.

238
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:03,920
Let's go.

239
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,880
You hit my sister's idea

240
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,520
and even watched the shooting stars.

241
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,920
I'll show you a shooting star hammer.

242
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,000
Qin Lan.

243
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,560
Coming.

244
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,280
Boss,

245
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,520
the usual.

246
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,120
I see.

247
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:30,920
Roasted garlic wonton.

248
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,480
Sir,

249
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,000
this way, please.

250
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,480
scene two

251
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,440
Is it yummy?

252
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:33,680
Yes.

253
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,200
I'll bring you more next time.

254
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,320
Everything is goodbye now.

255
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,360
Really, no use?

256
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,620
Sir, you're finished.

257
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,840
Sir, take care!

258
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,120
Miss, wake up.

259
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,840
Miss, wake up.

260
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,240
If you don't eat the wontons, you'll be a dead man.

261
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,240
Oh, I know.

262
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,840
Boss, this person is really weird.

263
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,040
Every time, he only eats the wontons with the bamboo shoots.

264
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,840
Do your work well.

265
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,240
Xiao'er.

266
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,840
Where did the person who only eats the wontons with the bamboo shoots go?

267
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,840
Oh, he went that way.

268
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,440
Jun Voilàia

269
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,840
There should be only this hope.

270
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,840
There is obviously another a Venus…

271
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,440
Boss!

272
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,940
It's getting late.

273
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,640
Wear these, and let's leave.

274
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,840
historically,

275
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,840
I think that sword has the 128ب Monocle Invertebrate on it's sleeve.

276
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,280
I'm more suitable for a suit with a gem on the chest.

277
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,320
Don't think that

278
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,600
this matter

279
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,440
is up to me.

280
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,320
Miss Qinglan.

281
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,600
My sister told me

282
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,360
not to go to the market to find her.

283
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,280
Just go to the place you agreed on.

284
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,280
She's waiting for you there.

285
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,600
This is the delicious food

286
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,000
she prepared for you this morning.

287
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,320
I'll eat it if you don't.

288
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,320
Thank you, Miss Qinglan.

289
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,200
You're welcome.

290
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,280
Miss, look at the flowers.

291
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,040
把调的 rend成怎么样?

292
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,120
No...

293
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:55,840
Let him go.

294
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:03,840
Let go!

295
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,960
I haven't seen Wang Quanhong's phone.

296
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,320
Clean the snake.

297
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,560
Wang Quanhong has been hiding somewhere else.

298
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,560
I can't find him.

299
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,040
Are you lying to me?

300
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,200
I'm doing this for your own good.

301
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,880
If you kill him,

302
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,960
you'll no longer be the second sword in the world.

303
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,120
I hope this is the last time.

304
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:47,920
I'm sorry.

305
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,360
Kid, do you remember

306
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,400
what your name was?

307
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,880
You're called An Naran.

308
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,000
You're the son of my An Nayan.

309
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,040
You're my own child.

310
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,480
When you sold me to the Zhang family

311
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,800
for five taels of silver,

312
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,560
why didn't you think of me as your son?

313
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,680
You knew the Zhang family buried me.

314
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,240
What were you going to do?

315
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,360
I know.

316
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,480
You look just like that young master of the Zhang family.

317
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,920
They buried you to be his substitute.

318
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,160
You don't know

319
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,040
what a substitute is?

320
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,040
Aren't you afraid that I'll die in the Zhang family?

321
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,840
But you didn't die.

322
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,160
You even became the master of the Zhang family.

323
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,080
Don't you know

324
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,400
how happy I was when I recognized you?

325
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,840
Everything I do now

326
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,160
is not because of you.

327
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,600
I don't owe you anything.

328
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,880
If they knew you were a fake,

329
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,000
would you still be the master of the Zhang family?

330
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,400
I promise you.

331
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,880
As long as you kill Wang Quanhongye

332
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,800
and let me sit in the position of the Demon King and the State Preceptor,

333
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,840
I'll let you go.

334
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,640
One last time.

335
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,760
One last time.

336
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:31,920
Sis.

337
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,160
Qinglan.

338
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,120
Why are you here?

339
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,320
Young Master Wang Quan asked me to come.

340
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,720
What's the matter?

341
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,480
He had something to talk to Li Quzhuo.

342
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,400
He said he couldn't watch the meteor shower with you at night.

343
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,880
He asked me to come with you.

344
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,720
It's important.

345
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:50,440
Let's go.

346
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,720
Take me to eat something delicious.

347
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,520
Okay.

348
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,120
That way.

349
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,520
Zhang Tongchong.

350
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,200
Good morning, Zhang Tongchong.

351
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,480
I'll go in first.

352
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,440
Zhang Tongchong.

353
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,720
I'm really not good at drawing this ghost-like paper.

354
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,040
Please.

355
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,960
You saved me once before.

356
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,880
Please save me again.

357
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,920
Zhang Tongchong.

358
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,800
Please help me.

359
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,880
Please.

360
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,880
You've finished drawing?

361
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:18,640
Yes.

362
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,080
Zhang Tongchong.

363
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,880
Why is your face so red?

364
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,480
Is it hot today?

365
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,200
I'm fine.

366
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,680
I'm fine.

367
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,680
I'm fine.

368
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,680
I'm fine.

369
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,680
I'm fine.

370
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,680
I'm fine.

371
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,680
I'm fine.

372
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,680
I'm fine.

373
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,680
I'm fine.

374
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,680
I'm fine.

375
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,680
I'm fine.

376
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,680
I'm fine.

377
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,160
Jinxing.

378
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,160
Yes.

379
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,000
Luson wonton.

380
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,560
Here is yours.

381
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,080
Don't eat this.

382
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,280
Eat this.

383
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,120
Try it.

384
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,280
Where are you going?

385
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,280
Zhang Tongchong.

386
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,120
See you tomorrow.

387
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,120
Why does it feel like

388
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,760
I've changed after I became the master?

389
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,440
My Lady,

390
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,400
this is the jade demon fruit you wanted.

391
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,280
It's a portrait of the Star Master.

392
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,480
It's really him.

393
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,080
Then it's all clear.

394
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,080
My Lady, what's wrong?

395
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,160
Nothing.

396
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,920
Keep an eye on Zhang Zheng's whereabouts.

397
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,320
I'm a little sleepy.

398
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,400
Do you want to eat?

399
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,440
Yes.

400
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,480
What do you want to eat?

401
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,920
I want to eat roasted chicken.

402
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,480
You only know how to eat.

403
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,400
You're so mischievous.

404
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,120
Miss Dongfang.

405
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,600
Where's my brother?

406
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,120
Didn't he go to the meteor shower with you?

407
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:04,920
He's gone.

408
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,720
He's gone.

409
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,400
He's gone.

410
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,120
He's gone.

411
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:07,760
He's gone.

412
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,400
He's gone.

413
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,160
He's gone.

414
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:09,920
He's gone.

415
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,640
He's gone.

416
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,440
He's gone.

417
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,280
He's gone.

418
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,280
Did Liu Xing go?

419
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,560
Didn't you go out to do something?

420
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,760
What did we do?

421
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,520
Qin Lan,

422
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,400
what's going on?

423
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,040
I...

424
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,560
I just don't want him to go to the meteor shower with you.

425
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,880
I didn't expect him to be so stubborn.

426
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,520
He should come back by himself

427
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,520
before he can meet someone.

428
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,600
Oh, no.

429
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,040
It's so cold at night.

430
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,240
Brother will get hurt.

431
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,080
Qu Zhuo,

432
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,880
please take care of Qin Lan.

433
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,600
I'll bring him back safely.

434
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,400
Sister, I'll go with you.

435
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:00,880
Hongye.

436
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,360
Hongye.

437
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,040
Hongye.

438
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,920
Hongye.

439
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:16,920
You're here.

440
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:40,880
I'm sorry.

441
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:47,880
Huai Zhu.

442
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,240
Look at Liu Xing.

443
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,520
I'm sorry.

444
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,400
I'm sorry.

445
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,280
I'm sorry.

446
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,200
I'm sorry.

447
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,280
I'm sorry.

448
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,160
I'm sorry.

449
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,000
I'm sorry.

450
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,200
Let everything be like a firefly

451
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,720
Let the sun and moon change their faces and be persistent

452
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,360
Let love also forget

453
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:24,160
The confusion of forgetting its fatal name

454
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:30,960
If I turn into a full moon in the dark night

455
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,960
Qin Lan is so naughty.

456
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,960
I'll talk to him when I get back.

457
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,080
No.

458
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,240
He prepared food for you

459
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,920
in the box.

460
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,880
He prepared it with all his heart.

461
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,040
Besides,

462
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,000
I just came here a while ago.

463
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,160
I know you'll come.

464
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:05,600
The flesh is crushed in your eyes like water.

465
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:12,000
I'll take off your eyes with my fingertips.

466
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,360
It's better this way.

467
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:40,280
Let everything be like a firefly

468
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:44,000
Let the sun and moon change their faces and be persistent

469
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Let love also forget

470
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:54,000
The confusion of forgetting its fatal name

471
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:01,000
If I turn into a full moon in the dark night

472
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,640
Qin Lan is so naughty.

473
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,160
I'll talk to him when I get back.

474
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:11,720
Let everything be like a firefly

475
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:15,720
Let love also forget

476
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:20,720
The confusion of forgetting its fatal name

477
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:27,720
If I turn into a full moon in the dark night

478
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,720
Qin Lan is so naughty.

479
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,720
I'll talk to him when I get back.

480
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:35,520
Let everything be like a firefly

481
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:39,520
Let love also forget

482
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:45,520
The confusion of forgetting its fatal name

483
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:53,520
If I turn into a full moon in the dark night

484
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,520
Qin Lan is so naughty.

485
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,520
I'll talk to him when I get back.

486
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:02,520
Let everything be like a firefly

487
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,520
I'm sorry for the trouble.

488
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,520
It's okay.

489
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,520
Can you be sincere?

490
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,520
Then

491
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,520
Three days

492
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,520
I will never say anything bad about you in three days.

493
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,520
I won't make you suffer.

494
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,520
Okay.

495
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,520
Thank you.

496
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,520
That

497
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:31,520
The medicine shopkeeper made some meat soup.

498
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,520
He'll come later.

499
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,520
I'll go to see him.

500
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,520
I'll go with you.

501
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,520
Xu Zhuo

502
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,520
You accompany your big brother.

503
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,520
I'll go with Xiao Mei.

504
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,520
Big brother

505
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,520
Big brother

506
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,520
Soup

507
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,520
Soup

508
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,520
I know.

509
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,520
I'll give you the bones.

510
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,520
You still know me.

511
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,520
You know me.

512
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,280
I...

513
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:56,760
By the way,

514
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,600
in order to avoid this from happening again,

515
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:15,100
I put on the

516
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,800
You went out with him alone again?

517
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,520
You don't like him that much?

518
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,240
Qi Jian,

519
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,920
you really changed your mind?

520
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,160
You'll understand

521
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,240
if I don't change my mind.

522
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,320
Anyway, I think the masked brother-in-law is good.

523
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,320
He's a thousand times better than the Young Master Wang Ba.

524
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,440
He's the masked brother-in-law

525
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,480
and another masked brother-in-law.

526
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,880
He's blind.

527
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,320
Brother,

528
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,280
how about I rush out

529
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,520
and tell Qin Lan that little girl

530
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,080
that you're the leader of the Masked Club?

531
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,000
No.

532
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,800
The Masked Club is a team.

533
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,640
It's a deal.

534
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,280
So, you're going to

535
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,240
be the leader of the Masked Club?

536
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,520
I just don't like that Young Master Wang Ba.

537
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,320
Actually,

538
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,720
he's a nice guy.

539
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,640
He's quite interesting.

540
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,360
How is that interesting?

541
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,920
He's a good guy

542
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,440
and he's always angry.

543
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,640
He's

544
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,640
a calm and innocent man

545
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,720
who doesn't fear small problems.

546
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,480
He's also a man of heart

547
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,680
and he's cold and heartless.

548
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,080
He's kind and gentle.

549
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,640
He's cold and warm-hearted.

550
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,040
Sister,

551
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,160
are we talking about the same Young Master Wang Ba?

552
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,680
Right?

553
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,280
Are you serious?

554
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,360
Yes.

555
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,440
So, is the leader of the Masked Club

556
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,600
your Moonlight

557
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,720
or your Heart?

558
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,560
The Moonlight on the Heart

559
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,160
is a match.

560
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,640
Sister,

561
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,360
you're on two boats.

562
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,760
I'm a silly girl.

563
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,760
If you don't go get the soup,

564
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,600
the soup will get cold.

565
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,240
It's better if it gets cold.

566
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,960
Just let him drink cold soup.

567
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,040
I can smell the soup.

568
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:35,880
They're coming.

569
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,760
So,

570
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,840
I'm so nice.

571
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,800
Clean it up.

572
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,040
You're even biting your ears.

573
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,400
friendship

574
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,120
I'll go get you the soup.

575
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:45,160
His Lordship's

576
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,240
Master.

577
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,840
Master, look.

578
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,240
For that flower,

579
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,040
our Zunmiao House has been injured.

580
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,040
Then let's start the competition.

581
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,240
Find some new people outside.

582
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,840
No matter what,

583
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,640
I want to absorb the flower.

584
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,840
Yes, master.

585
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,840
I told you to find Wang Quanhong's whereabouts.

586
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,240
Why is there no news yet?

587
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:22,240
The wind blows, the clouds stop.

588
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:27,240
The sorrowful atmosphere, the falling leaves, the morning breeze.

589
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,240
The encounter, the wind, the road.

590
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,240
Like a flower, like a fog.

591
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:38,240
You are in the distance, in the distance.

592
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:44,240
The wind blows, the clouds stop.

593
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:48,240
The sorrowful atmosphere, the falling leaves, the morning breeze.

594
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,240
The heart is not afraid of anything,

595
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,240
and the sincerity is put into it.

596
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:59,240
Love has forgotten the way back to the deep.

597
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,240
It flows into the desert.

598
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,240
The old city is not inhabited.

599
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:10,240
The moon and the tree are like old memories.

600
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:16,240
The missing of you and me.

601
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:20,240
I give you a warm sky.

602
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,240
I can see it from the beginning.

603
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,240
People have left years.

604
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,240
Look at the stars.

605
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,240
Love is like a first time.

606
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:36,240
I have seen it before.

607
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,240
I want to exchange you for my life.

608
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,240
Even if I forget it.

609
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,240
Look at the world.

610
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,240
I want to see you.

611
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,240
I want to see you.

612
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,240
I want to see you.

613
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,240
I want to see you.

614
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,240
I want to see you.

615
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,240
I want to see you.

616
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,240
I want to see you.

617
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,240
I want to see you.

618
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,240
I want to see you.

619
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,240
I want to see you.

620
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,240
I want to see you.

621
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,240
I want to see you.

622
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,240
I want to see you.

623
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,240
I want to see you.

624
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,240
I want to see you.

625
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,240
I want to see you.

626
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,240
I want to see you.
