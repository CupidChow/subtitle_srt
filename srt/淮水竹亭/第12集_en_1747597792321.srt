1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
ок

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,320
O

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,100
о

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,640
о

5
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:27,720
о

6
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:29,600
вы

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Oh

8
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Oh

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You

10
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,940
It's time to take the medicine

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Oh

12
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,460
Okay

13
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yitan, wake up.

14
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yitan, wake up.

15
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You're not strong at all.

16
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You're really good at controlling.

17
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Very good.

18
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Drink it all.

19
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm not sure if I said it right.

20
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's not your fault.

21
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's not your fault.

22
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's not your fault.

23
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Didn't you say a small wound?

24
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Why is it bleeding?

25
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's still bleeding.

26
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Because I was born with a blood clot.

27
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I hope for more.

28
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I hope for more.

29
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I only think about you in this life.

30
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I hope we can be together from now on.

31
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yitan, are you cold?

32
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You know if you don't want to die

33
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Let people know that there are two people

34
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You know that the flower is in full bloom

35
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's the most romantic thing

36
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You know that for a moment

37
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I drew the most beautiful heart

38
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You know your name

39
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,000
But I have never been the shortest love

40
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Yitan, you never touched your hand.

41
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
The whole world is actually like me.

42
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
The left sword is a step back.

43
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Don't use it.

44
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Brother, do you really only move your mouth?

45
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Can you do it?

46
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So this is the reason why you never came out.

47
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:56,000
The last day is the most warm start of my love.

48
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Brother, sister has so many clothes on her.

49
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's okay to take off one.

50
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
How can we lose to a little sister like this?

51
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
What's the point of playing like this?

52
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Why don't you just kill us?

53
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Is it a trick?

54
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
If I show my real strength, do you dare to be hard?

55
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I dare not

56
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
This time it's your brother's turn

57
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Let's bet who will be faster

58
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You are using a sword

59
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It shouldn't be

60
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Okay

61
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You lose

62
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I said you could live

63
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You guys are cheating

64
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You can cheat

65
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Why can't we?

66
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Jialai has never lost

67
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I don't know

68
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You guys are cheating

69
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You can cheat

70
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Why can't we?

71
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Jialai has never lost

72
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I will kill you two

73
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's you

74
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Very good

75
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I am satisfied

76
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Come with me

77
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Jialai

78
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You recognize her

79
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Is it beautiful here?

80
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Beautiful

81
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
So perfunctory

82
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You can't wait to leave

83
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You can't wait to leave

84
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
How can we leave?

85
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You only beat me once

86
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
So only one person can leave

87
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I will use all my power

88
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
To send you to a place

89
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You two can kill each other there

90
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Either you all die

91
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Or one of you kill the other

92
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
And leave here alive

93
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Who will leave here alive?

94
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
What is this place?

95
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
July 7

96
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Huaishuizhu Pavilion

97
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
This is very important to us

98
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
So this should be

99
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
The depth of our consciousness

100
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Dongfanghuizhu

101
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Is it the person Mr. Jiuhuo chose?

102
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
To be precise

103
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Jialai

104
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Why do you create this illusion?

105
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Do you know

106
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You will disappear

107
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
When the demon is near

108
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Mantua flower represents hatred

109
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Although you have cleared her memory

110
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
But Dongfanghuizhu still has love in her heart

111
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You want them

112
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
To kill the one they love

113
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Where they have the best memory

114
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Only in this way

115
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Mantua flower

116
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Can take her soul completely

117
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Only then

118
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Can she become a real

119
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:39,340
Perfect

120
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You are talking about a story again

121
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
If it is a story

122
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
How can you control fire?

123
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
That fire mark

124
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Do you really have no impression?

125
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Between you and me, there is no need

126
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Between you and me, there is only one life

127
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Mr. Jiuhuo

128
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
If you want to kill me

129
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You would have done it before

130
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
But if you use fire

131
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I will not be able to defeat you

132
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Okay.

133
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,400
Take the sword.

134
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,200
Let's fight again.

135
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,600
The soul of the heart.

136
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,120
If you die here,

137
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,600
your consciousness will also sink forever.

138
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,800
There is no difference between living and dead.

139
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,400
Then why don't you fight?

140
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,880
If there is a person among us who must die,

141
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,640
that person won't be you.

142
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
So,

143
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,600
you are willing to die for me?

144
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,000
I won't die for you.

145
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,000
I want us to live together.

146
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,400
Come with me to a place.

147
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,800
Where is this?

148
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,400
We were here before.

149
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,800
We saw the sunset together.

150
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,800
The sunset today

151
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,800
is falling so fast.

152
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,200
It will be better if it lasts a little longer.

153
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,800
If you think the sunset is short,

154
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,400
next time,

155
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,200
let's watch the stars together.

156
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,800
Okay.

157
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
The Sunset

158
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,400
You...

159
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,600
What do you remember?

160
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,200
I...

161
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,200
I remember.

162
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,800
Remember?

163
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,800
What?

164
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
This is...

165
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,600
I remember.

166
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,200
This is your place.

167
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
This is your place to die.

168
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,200
Remember,

169
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,000
you are the bad guy from the East.

170
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,800
I must not believe Jiuhuo.

171
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,800
Wang Quanhongye,

172
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,600
Lord Jiuhuo,

173
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,000
I don't believe anyone.

174
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,800
I only believe myself.

175
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,600
How is he?

176
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,800
He...

177
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,400
was killed by you in the illusion.

178
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,800
He will be in a dream forever.

179
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,400
He won't wake up again.

180
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,800
What?

181
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,800
You don't want to?

182
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,400
How come?

183
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,400
He has already died.

184
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,800
In the end, his own life is more important.

185
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,800
Sister,

186
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,400
you have to look forward.

187
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,800
I have already won.

188
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,200
Can I go out now?

189
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,000
Sister,

190
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,200
look at the scenery here with me.

191
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,200
I am not a corpse.

192
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,000
I am just a shadow left by the demon

193
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,400
when Jialan left the Sky Mountain.

194
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,600
I am about to disappear.

195
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,000
When I disappear,

196
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,800
the barrier of the Sky Mountain

197
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,400
will be broken.

198
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,000
It's interesting to see the scenery.

199
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,000
I want to hear

200
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,600
the story of you and Lord Jiuhuo.

201
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,800
Why?

202
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,000
You are not like the kind of person who likes to ask questions.

203
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,600
Because

204
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,200
we are alike.

205
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,200
And I want to know

206
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,400
if Lord Jiuhuo is worth following me.

207
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,000
Of course.

208
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,600
Lord Jiuhuo is the only one

209
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,600
who loves us in this world.

210
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,800
The only one?

211
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,200
Your appearance

212
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,600
is very pleasing to the eye.

213
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,600
That's because

214
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,400
I was born evil.

215
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,400
According to the legend,

216
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,200
you were born

217
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,000
a bad fox.

218
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,200
You probably know that

219
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,200
there is a huge bitter love tree in our Mountain.

220
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,400
The most powerful fox demons in our Mountain

221
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,800
have no parents

222
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,600
and are born from bitter love trees.

223
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,600
It is said that I was born

224
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,400
different from other fox demons.

225
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,600
My body is black.

226
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,600
My power is very strong.

227
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,400
I turned into a human when I was ten years old.

228
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,200
I was born different from those fox demons

229
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,600
who like flowers and grass.

230
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,000
The elders of Mount Tushan

231
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,800
soon found out my difference.

232
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,200
They pushed the image

233
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,800
and calculated my fate.

234
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,400
They said that I was born evil

235
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,000
who was born out of the grudge of the heaven and earth.

236
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,200
I will destroy the heaven and earth in the future.

237
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,400
So they sent me

238
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,000
to a love-trap beyond Mount Tushan

239
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,800
and set up a trap

240
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,400
and gave me a seed of bitter love tree.

241
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,200
They lied to me that

242
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,400
as long as I could plant a bitter love tree,

243
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,000
I could be free.

244
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,200
In the end,

245
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,800
I planted a black bitter love tree

246
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,800
with my hatred.

247
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,600
My power also grew

248
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,800
with this black tree.

249
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,600
I am waiting for them in the love trap.

250
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,400
I want to tell them something.

251
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,000
I will revenge

252
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
those who hurt me.

253
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,800
Who are you?

254
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,400
You killed

255
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,200
all these demons?

256
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,600
Interesting.

257
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,600
But

258
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,400
many fox demons will come to kill you soon.

259
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,800
I am the heaven demon Jiuhuo of the imperial family.

260
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,200
Come with me.

261
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,600
Do you think they deserve to die?

262
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
No.

263
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,400
That's good.

264
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,000
In addition to Lord Jiuhuo,

265
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,000
there is another person waiting for me.

266
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,800
They want to imprison me for life.

267
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,600
Why can't I kill them all?

268
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,200
What happened after that?

269
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,400
Why are you left with only the shadow?

270
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,200
I am the god of death.

271
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,800
Why are you left with only the shadow?

272
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,800
Did Lord Jiuhuo repair the Golden Pond

273
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,000
for you?

274
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,800
There are many problems.

275
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,200
But I have no time.

276
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,800
You are going to disappear.

277
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,800
Lord Jiuhuo just looks at you like this.

278
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,200
He promised me.

279
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,400
He doesn't want to see me disappear.

280
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,800
We will meet again.

281
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,000
That's good.

282
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,400
Instead of letting you disappear,

283
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,800
why don't you give me your power?

284
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,800
What a pity.

285
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,400
I like to listen to stories.

286
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,600
But I am never moved by other people's stories.

287
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,600
The red night of death.

288
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,200
The moment I died,

289
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,600
it was quite beautiful.

290
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,400
The Golden Pond

291
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,200
Lord Jiuhuo.

292
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,600
What happened?

293
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,800
The broken pieces of the Golden Pond

294
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,800
still lack one piece.

295
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,800
I deserve to die.

296
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
A water drug has been with me for a long time.

297
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,600
I don't know why it still remains.

298
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,600
It has been thrown away from the Golden Pond.

299
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,800
Such a big thing happened.

300
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,400
You tell me now.

301
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,800
Seven Star Pearl will end in a few days.

302
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,000
Don't worry, sir.

303
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,000
I have sent people to search the city.

304
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,400
I will find it soon.

305
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,800
If you can't find it,

306
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,400
I will use you to make up for it.

307
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Yes.

308
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,200
Is the Left Guardian back?

309
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,200
Yes, he is in the room.

310
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,200
The Red Night of Death

311
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Who is it?

312
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,200
The Red Night of Death

313
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,200
Miss, what do you want?

314
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,200
Miss. Miss.

315
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,200
Miss, I didn't mean to do that.

316
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,000
I just disturbed you.

317
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,400
I am really sorry.

318
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,200
I just want to ask you for directions.

319
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,800
Miss.

320
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,600
Water Spirit Eye?

321
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,600
Miss, you are a medical doctor from the Demon Realm.

322
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,200
You are from the Water Tribe.

323
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,800
Tian Eye?

324
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:47,000
Where are you going?

325
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,400
Miss, please tell me how to get to the Golden Pond.

326
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,200
Miss, what's wrong?

327
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,000
Why are you going to the Golden Pond?

328
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,600
Do you have to go there?

329
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,000
Because there are some things

330
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,400
I have to go there to figure it out.

331
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,400
So, please don't bother me.

332
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,800
Go five miles north from here.

333
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,400
Ten miles west.

334
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,400
Then go north to a village.

335
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,000
Then ten miles east. Then you will...

336
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,600
Miss, can you slow down a little bit?

337
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,400
Go three miles east.

338
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,200
Thank you.

339
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,400
Why did she leave?

340
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,600
Thank you, Miss.

341
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,800
You have to remember that you are the owner of the Eastern Region.

342
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:07,000
You must not believe in the Nine Deadly Sins.

343
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:21,000
Why am I exactly the same as that Jialan's demon?

344
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,400
Very good. I am very satisfied.

345
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,200
Who is Jialan exactly?

346
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,000
What is she satisfied with?

347
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:42,000
Since you are back, why didn't you come to see me?

348
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:46,200
Are you angry that I didn't save you from the barrier of the Sky Mountain?

349
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,600
How could that be?

350
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,000
You only trusted me.

351
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,600
And I saw the old brother of your master there.

352
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:59,200
I saw your former disciple, Jialan.

353
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,600
That's just a shadow.

354
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:08,200
But the demon's body is clearly the same as Jialan's shadow.

355
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,400
Shouldn't you give me an explanation?

356
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,000
In the chaos of the Demon-Killing Method,

357
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,200
when I picked you up, you were in a state of panic.

358
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,600
I used Jialan's demon power to enter your body.

359
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,600
But his demon power is too strong.

360
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:28,600
After you regained your demon power, you forgot the past.

361
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,800
Then what was my identity before I lost my memory?

362
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:36,400
Is it possible that I really know Wang Quanhong?

363
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,400
I don't know that.

364
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,000
But the human race has always been greedy for demon power.

365
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,800
To get and control the demon, to play with the emperor.

366
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,800
You should know that.

367
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,400
I won't believe it.

368
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,200
It's just...

369
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,200
Just what?

370
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,400
Your power is boundless.

371
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,800
You must be happy to be with Jialan.

372
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,200
I'm curious about your story.

373
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,600
Since I took Jialan as my disciple,

374
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,800
the dragon tribe and the Tushan tribe have been fighting against me.

375
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
In this battle, my demon core has been destroyed.

376
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,600
But he actually fought alone for me.

377
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,600
I'm a demon of all kinds.

378
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,400
What's my grudge against you?

379
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,800
Let's go.

380
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:20,400
He took the dragon elixir back and used it to repair my demon power.

381
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:25,400
We all realized that we are each other's only.

382
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,400
But it's been a long time since we found out that 500 years ago,

383
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,400
Jialan was able to drive away the dark forces of the demons

384
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,400
and was taken by the Yuyang State's Chief.

385
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,400
They set up a trap to destroy me.

386
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:43,400
In order to save me, Jialan came to the Yuyang State's underground palace.

387
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,400
500 years ago, in the underground palace of the Yuyang State,

388
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,400
what happened between you and Jialan?

389
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,400
Jialan!

390
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:00,400
This memory is something I never want to forget.

391
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:06,400
In short, everything I do now is to save Jialan.

392
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,400
You mean Jialan is still alive?

393
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,400
Of course.

394
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:17,400
But she's blocked outside the circle and can't come in.

395
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:21,400
It's a pity that I'm not Jialan. I can't help you.

396
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:26,400
It's okay. Jialan is Jialan and you are you.

397
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,400
You just have to be yourself.

398
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,400
There's nothing else to think about.

399
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,400
As for that Wang Quan Hong Yi...

400
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,400
He's already dead.

401
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:39,400
A man who's been digging and practicing swords and holding on to the blood of the Yi Qimeng clan.

402
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,400
He just wants to get my power.

403
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,400
He's not going to die.

404
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,400
All of this is in the past.

405
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,400
You don't have to think about it.

406
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,400
Yes, my Lord Jiuhuo.

407
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:22,400
I can't be left out in your eyes.

408
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,400
I'm falling again.
