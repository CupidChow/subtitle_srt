1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The truth is...

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The truth is...

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The truth is...

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The truth is...

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The truth is...

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The truth is...

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The truth is...

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The truth is...

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The truth is...

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The truth is...

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The truth is...

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The truth is...

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The truth is...

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The truth is...

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The truth is...

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The truth is...

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The truth is...

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The truth is...

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The truth is...

20
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
There are many things that are not normal in this world.

21
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
My heart is getting more and more restless.

22
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I should have been the Prime Minister when you gave me the Golden Blue.

23
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I am the Red Seal of the Golden Fist.

24
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I have something I have to do. I can't do it.

25
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You have to be careful.

26
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Be careful of the beast that is the Red Seal of the Golden Fist.

27
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Young Master Wang Quan, let's say goodbye.

28
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I will never see you again.

29
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I hope I can understand shopkeeper still living.

30
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,480
remote

31
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,880
Imperial thuilts

32
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,760
Chair again

33
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,400
I'm sorry

34
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,460
Should we go home?

35
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,300
I just feel sorry for him

36
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,360
Have some meat

37
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,620
Now you feel sorry for Lengtin

38
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,340
You can't just eat.

39
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,060
Thank you for reminding me.

40
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,020
Love and life are the same.

41
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:56,060
There's no such thing as a smooth wind.

42
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,940
Who did you learn these from?

43
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,820
I made them myself.

44
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:00,860
Let's get to the point.

45
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,780
The monster you found in the Fish Monster Kingdom.

46
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,540
Let's investigate it together.

47
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,540
The Monster Kingdom

48
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,660
Brother, it's an emergency.

49
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,460
I followed the monster in the Fish Monster Kingdom.

50
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,860
I found that monster going to the Fire Mountain Village twice.

51
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,860
Fire Mountain Village?

52
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,540
From the account book,

53
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:41,540
your thoughts are very detailed.

54
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,540
But your handwriting is very rough.

55
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,540
I'm very curious about you.

56
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,540
Who are you?

57
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:03,540
You are very important to me.

58
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:09,540
I've been here twice to take you away.

59
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,540
It's no use for you to resist.

60
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,540
Fire Mountain Village

61
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,540
Hurry up!

62
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,540
Fire Mountain Village

63
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,540
Fire Mountain Village

64
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,540
Jin Chen Qi

65
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:05,540
The holy weapon of the Fire Mountain Village, Jin Chen Qi

66
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,540
has been destroyed.

67
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:12,540
Who broke into the Golden Emperor of the Fire Mountain Village?

68
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,540
My lord!

69
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,540
Jin Chen Qi

70
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,540
It's been 500 years.

71
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:36,540
I'm willing to welcome you back here.

72
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,540
Welcome back, my lord!

73
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:44,540
I'm back to complete a great thing.

74
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,540
From now on,

75
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:50,540
the city of Bi Luo is the master of this world.

76
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,540
The one who kills me is alive.

77
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,540
The one who kills me is dead.

78
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,540
Jin Chen Qi

79
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,540
Jin Chen Qi

80
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,540
Li Ju Zhu

81
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:55,540
Jin Chen Qi

82
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,540
Jin Chen Qi

83
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,540
Jin Chen Qi

84
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,580
You can go back to the past and go to the future.

85
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,140
According to the information left by the magic weapons,

86
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,540
they were sent to the future.

87
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,300
How far is the future?

88
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,500
They went there 20 years later.

89
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:46,060
Why did the demon take Miss Dongfang to the future?

90
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,700
We'll know when we get there.

91
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,180
Li Xuzhuang, open the magic weapon.

92
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,100
Let's go together.

93
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,020
No.

94
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,100
I have to stay here

95
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,980
to turn the magic array around and bring you back.

96
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,660
And the principle of the time and space is very complicated.

97
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,220
You'll be there for a few hours.

98
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:01,220
It'll be several months after we get there.

99
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:04,740
Brother,

100
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,780
I'll be able to get rid of it before dawn.

101
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,140
When you bring it back,

102
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:15,060
open it as soon as you find Miss Huizhu.

103
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,860
It can be connected to the golden curtain.

104
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,380
But it's a magic weapon.

105
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,100
Remember,

106
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,340
you can only use it once.

107
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,220
I got it.

108
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,220
Hurry up.

109
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:33,100
After 14, 000 years later

110
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,580
Zhu,

111
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:56,580
Maybe one day, the darkness will take over your life.

112
00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:04,580
But you must believe that there will be a star that will light up your path.

113
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:23,580
The star that will light up your path

114
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:28,580
is the star that will light up your path.

115
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:33,580
The star that will light up your path is the star that will light up your path.

116
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:38,580
The star that will light up your path is the star that will light up your path.

117
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:43,580
The star that will light up your path is the star that will light up your path.

118
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:48,580
Sir, the woman you brought back is awake.

119
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:51,580
You go out.

120
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,580
Yes.

121
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:57,580
The wounds caused by the dragon bone

122
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:01,580
can't even be healed with my power.

123
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:06,580
Only the blood can be returned.

124
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:18,580
Are you having this kind of dream every day?

125
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:22,580
You seem to be very concerned about it.

126
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:26,580
Who are you? Where are you?

127
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:32,580
My name is Jiuhuo. This is the city of Biluo.

128
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:37,580
Why did you bring me here?

129
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:44,580
I can't answer this question for now.

130
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:54,580
That's right. Your power is beyond your control.

131
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:59,580
What do you want to do?

132
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:04,580
I want to ask you to do me a favor.

133
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,580
I want you to save someone.

134
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:10,580
I don't know what you're talking about, but I won't help you.

135
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:17,580
Do you know why you were born in the Eastern Hall?

136
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:35,580
What is this? You've put a demon power into my body.

137
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:38,580
You should know more than this.

138
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:42,580
Feel the power of this demon.

139
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,580
Feel it again.

140
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:49,580
Has it become one with your bones?

141
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:54,580
No way.

142
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,580
No way.

143
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:03,580
So do you really know who you are and why you were born?

144
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,580
Ye Yuan.

145
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,580
Yes, Your Highness.

146
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:29,580
It should take some time for him to wake up next time.

147
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:33,580
He didn't remember who he was at that time.

148
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:37,580
You tell him that he's called Huai Chu.

149
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:41,580
He's the protector of my Jiuhuo.

150
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:44,580
I'm not going to let him go.

151
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:50,580
Huai Chu is the protector of my Jiuhuo.

152
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,580
Yes.

153
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:55,580
The fire is gone.

154
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:59,580
The flowers are blooming.

155
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:02,580
Dongfeng Huai Chu will no longer exist.

156
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:07,580
You are the perfect weapon of Jialan.

157
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:19,580
Where are we?

158
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:23,580
This is still Huai Chu's room.

159
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,580
How is that possible?

160
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:29,580
Where are the people from the Fire Tribe?

161
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,580
No one.

162
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:39,580
There's no one in the Fire Tribe.

163
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:49,580
Let's go to Ruyi Pavilion.

164
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:19,580
What's going on?

165
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:22,580
What happened here?

166
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,580
This is what happened in Ruyi Pavilion.

167
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:28,580
No one will be in the Qingmu family.

168
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,580
Let's go.

169
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,580
Help!

170
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,580
Help!

171
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,580
Enough! He's dead!

172
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,580
Don't be afraid.

173
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:19,580
We are from the Yiqi Alliance.

174
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,580
The Yiqi Alliance?

175
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:25,580
It was gone five years ago.

176
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,580
Five years ago?

177
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:31,580
What year is it now?

178
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,580
It's been 37 years.

179
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,580
What's wrong?

180
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,580
We've been here for 20 years.

181
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,580
What happened to this world?

182
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,580
How did it become like this?

183
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,580
If you didn't kill me, I would've killed you.

184
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:49,580
I deserve to die!

185
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,580
He's gone crazy.

186
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,580
I'm not crazy!

187
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,580
This is what happened.

188
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,580
The Yiqi Alliance is dead.

189
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,580
They killed each other.

190
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,580
Ruo Zhi doesn't deserve to live.

191
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,580
If I didn't kill that demon,

192
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,580
he would've been killed by his accomplices.

193
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,580
I would've been the one who killed him!

194
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,580
Calm down.

195
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,580
Tell me first.

196
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,580
How did the Yiqi Alliance die?

197
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:19,580
How would I know?

198
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:23,580
Those families...

199
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:27,580
Those families were all defeated.

200
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,580
They don't care about us anymore.

201
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:33,580
We just have to live our lives.

202
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:38,580
The night of eternity is coming.

203
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:44,580
The night of eternity is coming.

204
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,580
You're so capable.

205
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:01,580
Please take me back to Bi Luo City.

206
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,580
I have money.

207
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,580
I have a lot of money.

208
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,580
I can give it to you.

209
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,580
Get up.

210
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,580
I'll give it to you.

211
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:12,580
I'll give it to you all.

212
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,580
Let me ask you.

213
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:18,580
What is Bi Luo City?

214
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:22,580
You don't even know about Bi Luo City?

215
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:26,580
Bi Luo City is the capital of the imperial family.

216
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:31,580
It's the last paradise for the demons.

217
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:32,580
You're so mean.

218
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:36,580
Brother, don't believe him.

219
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:41,580
Where is the Bi Luo City you mentioned?

220
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,580
Money?

221
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:48,580
I have money?

222
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:55,580
He said that Bi Luo City is the capital of the imperial family.

223
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,580
I used my eyes to find out about the demon's heart.

224
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:03,580
I'm sure that it belongs to the imperial family.

225
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:09,580
It seems that I have to go.

226
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:39,580
I'm going to the capital.

227
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:42,580
I'm going to the capital.

228
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:45,580
I'm going to the capital.

229
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:48,580
I'm going to the capital.

230
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:51,580
I'm going to the capital.

231
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:54,580
I'm going to the capital.

232
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:57,580
I'm going to the capital.

233
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:00,580
I'm going to the capital.

234
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:03,580
I'm going to the capital.

235
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:06,580
I'm going to the capital.

236
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,580
I'm going to the capital.

237
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:12,580
I'm going to the capital.

238
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:15,580
I'm going to the capital.

239
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:18,580
I'm going to the capital.

240
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:21,580
I'm going to the capital.

241
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:24,580
I'm going to the capital.

242
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:27,580
I'm going to the capital.

243
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:30,580
I'm going to the capital.

244
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:33,580
I'm going to the capital.

245
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:36,580
I'm going to the capital.

246
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,580
Manage There.

247
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,920
Wan mount!

248
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,920
The hallway?!

249
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,900
Won't knock it just go to the way's gate.

250
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,900
Like an Ya문.

251
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,740
h yeah

252
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,740
But what?

253
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,740
Wu Xiaowu is dead.

254
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:08,740
Chu Jinmei is gone.

255
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,740
Han Yan's happiness

256
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,740
was also buried.

257
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:17,740
You gave me the Golden Blue.

258
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,740
I should also treat you with respect.

259
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,740
Young Master Wangqun,

260
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,740
please wait.

261
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,740
Han Yan's happiness

262
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,740
was buried.

263
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:02,740
Bi Luo City.

264
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,740
Bi Luo City.

265
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,740
Bi Luo City.

266
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,740
Run slowly.

267
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:35,740
Be careful.

268
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,740
Look, Bi Luo City.

269
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,740
I didn't lie to you.

270
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,740
It's really Bi Luo City.

271
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,740
But there are two last scenes.

272
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:47,740
I succeeded.

273
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,740
Bi Luo City.

274
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,740
I succeeded.

275
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,740
I succeeded.

276
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,740
I succeeded.

277
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:57,740
Bi Luo City.

278
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,740
Brother,

279
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,740
this place looks nice.

280
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,740
The only happy place in the hell.

281
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,740
Let's split up.

282
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,740
There will be a hotel later.

283
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,740
Okay.

284
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,740
As usual.

285
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,740
Let's go.

286
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,740
Master Wu is amazing.

287
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,740
Miss, look.

288
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,740
Move aside.

289
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:41,740
Move aside.

290
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,740
Stop.

291
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,740
Move aside.

292
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:45,740
Stop.

293
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,740
Don't run.

294
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:52,740
Stop.

295
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,740
The law of protection is not followed.

296
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,740
If you have a complaint, you are wronged.

297
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,740
If you have a favor, you are punished.

298
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,740
The law of protection is found.

299
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,740
If you have a complaint, you are wronged.

300
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:11,740
No one is punished except you who violates it.

301
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,740
The law of protection,

302
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,740
Yu einer 과 zu verk Andreas sharply her zu crise Shanghai

303
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,740
I have a complaint!

304
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,740
Stop right there.

305
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,740
I have a complaint

306
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,740
to Please take a leave from the law of protection.

307
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,740
What is your complaint?

308
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:29,740
Speak up.

309
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,740
Please speak up.

310
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:33,740
Speak.

311
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,740
He is the Demon-slayer.

312
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,740
He is the Demon-slayer!

313
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:44,740
After I came to Biluo City, he still used the Demon-slayer to control me.

314
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:48,240
I finally escaped and suddenly saved me.

315
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,240
I didn't. He's talking nonsense.

316
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,740
You should know that this is Biluo City.

317
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:57,740
And our City Leader hates the Demon-slayer the most.

318
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,740
I don't have the Demon-slayer.

319
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,740
I don't have the Demon-slayer.

320
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:06,740
If you lie, I will die.

321
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,740
Really?

322
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,740
Think about it.

323
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:20,740
Your Excellency, I did use the Demon-slayer.

324
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:25,740
As long as I have the Demon-slayer, I can do anything.

325
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:29,740
Your Excellency, you have to help me.

326
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,740
What did you say?

327
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,740
You can't die easily.

328
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,740
Bad pig.

329
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,740
Thank you, Your Excellency.

330
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,740
Thank you, City Leader.

331
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,740
Thank you, Biluo City.

332
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:59,740
Biluo City, please protect our land.

333
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:04,740
Biluo City, please protect our land.

334
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,740
As we all know,

335
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,740
after the Alliance was destroyed,

336
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:11,740
the world was full of strong people.

337
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:15,740
The human and the demon were always in a panic.

338
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:22,740
Only Biluo City is the land where human and demon coexist.

339
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:25,740
I will do anything to protect Biluo City.

340
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:28,740
I will do anything to protect Biluo City.

341
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,740
If you have no place to go,

342
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:33,740
you can go to the inn in the capital.

343
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:34,740
It's safe there.

344
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,740
Thank you, Your Excellency.

345
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,740
As for that unlucky person,

346
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:42,740
take him back and hang him at the gate of the city.

347
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,740
He will be safe.

348
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,740
The east is in danger.

349
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,740
Who is this?

350
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,740
You don't recognize me?

351
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,740
Should I recognize you?

352
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,740
Run!

353
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:55,740
Your sword has no murderous aura.

354
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,740
You can't bear to hurt me.

355
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,740
I'm a little curious.

356
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:20,860
You are a eastern

357
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:28,900
Chinese

358
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:29,300
Man.

359
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,300
Sir.

360
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,700
Are you под案麻 rätt?

361
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,200
In although the left bodyguard planning.

362
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,800
He said it's safe here.

363
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:00,800
But...

364
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
But I don't have money.

365
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,800
We're all guests in Biluocheng.

366
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,000
Why are you talking about money?

367
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,400
Hurry up. This way, please.

368
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:10,800
Come on.

369
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,500
Hurry up.

370
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,000
Thank you.

371
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:14,900
Come on.

372
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,000
Let's go upstairs.

373
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:16,800
Okay.

374
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,000
It's not easy.

375
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,800
Another big poison has come.

376
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,400
It can be used to repair the golden dust.

377
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,200
In a few days,

378
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,200
we should finish the rest.

379
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,800
We've spent a lot of time

380
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,400
to make a thousand pieces of broken gold.

381
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,000
Be gentle.

382
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,200
Even one piece is missing.

383
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,800
Lord Yeyuan will kill us.

384
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,800
Don't worry, brother.

385
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,000
Let's go.

386
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Your Excellency,

387
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,400
do you want to tell Lord Jiuhuo

388
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,400
what happened outside today?

389
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,400
It's a good thing to be loyal.

390
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,600
There's only one life.

391
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,200
I understand.

392
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,000
I will never talk about the protection.

393
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,200
I deserve to die.

394
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
You don't recognize me?

395
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,000
You're the Lord of the East.

396
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,400
You're not a protector.

397
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,800
If you don't remember,

398
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,600
I'll remember it for you.

399
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,800
It's strange.

400
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,400
What does Lord Jiuhuo have to do with me?

401
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,400
Brother, you're okay after taking the antidote, right?

402
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,200
Why is it like this?

403
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,600
There's a drug in his body.

404
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,600
And it's working.

405
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,600
Wicked Master,

406
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,600
what happened to you?

407
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,400
Your Excellency, I'm Liu.

408
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,200
Yeyuan's protector asked me to serve him.

409
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,600
I'm sorry.

410
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,600
Is my face so scary?

411
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,600
I'm scared.

412
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,600
Raise your head.

413
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,200
You died for me.

414
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,200
I'll remember your face.

415
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,600
Left Guardian.

416
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,200
Lord Jiuhuo ordered that no one can enter his room.

417
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,200
I have something important to report.

418
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,600
Lord Jiuhuo.

419
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,600
Lord Jiuhuo.

420
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,000
Why do you have blood?

421
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,000
Lord, are you okay?

422
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,000
Lord, you're hurt.

423
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,600
Leave.

424
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,600
I'm tired.

425
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,400
Lord.

426
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,200
Leave.

427
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,600
Yeyuan.

428
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,600
Lord, your blood is broken.

429
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I'll find the food again.

430
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,000
Lord, I'm sorry.

431
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,600
I'm sorry.

432
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,600
I'm sorry.

433
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,600
I'm sorry.

434
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,600
I'm sorry.

435
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,600
I'm sorry.

436
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,600
I'm sorry.

437
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,600
I'm sorry.

438
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,600
I'm sorry.

439
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,600
I'm sorry.

440
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,600
I'm sorry.

441
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,600
I told you.

442
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:56,600
He's very important to me.

443
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,600
Are you jealous?

444
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,600
Lord Jiuhuo.

445
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,600
I won't do it again.

446
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,600
Will it happen again?

447
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,600
I won't.

448
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,600
I won't.

449
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:53,600
I'll take your eyes off with my fingertips.

450
00:39:54,600 --> 00:40:00,600
I'll follow the smoke and let you fall.

451
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:05,600
Let everything be like a firework.

452
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,600
Let the day and night change into persistence.

453
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,600
Let love be forgotten.

454
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:25,600
Let tussen alive Christmas be forgotten.

455
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:34,600
Letло bepaid Christmas.
