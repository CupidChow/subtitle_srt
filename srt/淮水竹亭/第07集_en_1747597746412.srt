1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The truth is...

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The truth is...

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The truth is...

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The truth is...

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The truth is...

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The truth is...

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The truth is...

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The truth is...

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The truth is...

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The truth is...

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The truth is...

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The truth is...

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The truth is...

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The truth is...

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The truth is...

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The truth is...

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The truth is...

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The truth is...

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
After you leave,

20
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
you must become a good medicine.

21
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Brother Shen Wu,

22
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I killed someone.

23
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm not a good medicine anymore.

24
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What should I do?

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm not a good medicine anymore.

26
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What should I do?

27
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yang,

28
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm looking for you.

29
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You're not coming out, are you?

30
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Let me ask you.

31
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Is the person you've been talking about

32
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Mu Ren Zhi?

33
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
If you don't talk,

34
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'll go back and cut off your hands,

35
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
your arms, and your legs!

36
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What's wrong with Brother Wu?

37
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
What?

38
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
He's in the police department now.

39
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
If you want him to live,

40
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
hand over your stolen jade talisman.

41
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Sir.

42
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Yang,

43
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'll give you a chance to kill yourself.

44
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What?

45
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You can't bear to kill yourself?

46
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Take it.

47
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Die!

48
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You're dead!

49
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Young Master Wang Quan,

50
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
we're waiting for you to kill the monster.

51
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
We'll take him back.

52
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You can leave.

53
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Young Master,

54
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
the police department always has an independent group.

55
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm afraid you're not fit to do this.

56
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Good.

57
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'll go and get the jade talisman.

58
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'll go and get the jade talisman.

59
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Good.

60
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'll obey Young Master's order.

61
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Take him away.

62
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
That woman is so annoying.

63
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
What are you doing?

64
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I didn't mean to do it.

65
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I was controlled by Yang.

66
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You're so annoying.

67
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Go to hell!

68
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Go to hell!

69
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Wait!

70
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You spent tens of thousands of silver dollars on these jade talismans.

71
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Liu Yun Xuan has been in a bad mood recently.

72
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I've already got a lot of these.

73
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
With this jade talisman,

74
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
you can drive the monster,

75
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
and do anything to get it.

76
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
If the monster resists,

77
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
you can burn this talisman.

78
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
The monster will also die.

79
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Do you think the person who made this

80
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
is a talent?

81
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
The family that uses the jade talisman in the dark

82
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
is as rich as cattle.

83
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Only Wang Quan's family is not in the fire.

84
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
They've been using the jade talisman

85
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
with the position of the leader.

86
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Master.

87
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Master of the South Palace,

88
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm sorry to have offended you.

89
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I've come to ask Yang Ying to apologize to you.

90
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
What?

91
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
The mine is closed?

92
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
The Yang family is in a hurry?

93
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Apologize?

94
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
The Yang family has a big problem!

95
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Yang Ying

96
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
What time is it?

97
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Who is it?

98
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Boss Liu, it's me.

99
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm here.

100
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Miss Huai Zhu?

101
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
What is it?

102
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It's all right now.

103
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Her drug is being de-cellulated.

104
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,800
and recover from the burn.

105
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,240
But she shouldn't be moved for a short time.

106
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,240
No hurry.

107
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,920
We'll talk when she wakes up.

108
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,480
Boss.

109
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,800
Please bring some more medicine.

110
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,600
Then you can go to bed.

111
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,080
I'll take care of the patient.

112
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,960
Okay.

113
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,640
I'm sorry for what I did today.

114
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,920
What's wrong with me?

115
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,120
You followed me to the funeral.

116
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,520
I didn't even finish the wedding.

117
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,760
I'm worried

118
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,560
that I'll be sad in the future.

119
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,120
If you're sad,

120
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,920
I'll find you a fork.

121
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,960
You have to keep it.

122
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,800
Okay.

123
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,400
I'll keep it.

124
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,000
They're so shy.

125
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,960
I haven't found a girl like him yet.

126
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,080
What should I do?

127
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,080
What?

128
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,240
Yitan is not a good man.

129
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,120
Sit down, Yitan.

130
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,720
Yitan is a man of great ambition.

131
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,920
But when I see him,

132
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,960
I think of us when we were kids.

133
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,560
We were like mud.

134
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,680
You hit me with your nose and face.

135
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,720
You forced me to live.

136
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:03,920
I...

137
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,840
Be careful.

138
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,640
If you're sleepy, go to bed.

139
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,280
Thank you.

140
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,400
I'll take care of the house.

141
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,520
Don't keep me waiting.

142
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,280
It's okay.

143
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,680
I promised my brother.

144
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,480
Before he comes back,

145
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,760
I'll protect you.

146
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,520
Are you hungry?

147
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,560
The wine, the osmanthus and the mandarin duck

148
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,240
are all prepared by our cook.

149
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,520
Please have a try.

150
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,560
Great. We're all hungry.

151
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,120
It's just a small wound. It's okay.

152
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,240
Every year, there are many heroes

153
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,280
who are as strong as the young master.

154
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,040
They say they're okay,

155
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,040
but they end up bleeding.

156
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,480
Let me see.

157
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:36,560
Can you

158
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,760
I'm used to it.

159
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,100
Actually, it hurts.

160
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,760
Thank you for your help.

161
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,100
If you want to repay me with a favor,

162
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,900
I don't need it.

163
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,100
Actually, that kind of move

164
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,100
won't hurt you at all.

165
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,960
I'm just being too much.

166
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,400
I know that you're not being too much.

167
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,400
I'm also grateful for that.

168
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,400
If you really want to thank me,

169
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,200
why don't you...

170
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,900
Why don't you buy me a drink?

171
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,900
Let's drink.

172
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,400
Young Master, you shouldn't drink at this time.

173
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,400
Red Flower wants to drink, so it's not a drink.

174
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,900
Miss Huai Zhu asked me to buy you a drink.

175
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,900
So I'm the only one who can see you.

176
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,900
Sometimes I feel that

177
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,900
you're the only one

178
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,900
who can see me.

179
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,900
I'm the only one who's so smart

180
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,900
that you can see me from afar.

181
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,900
What about the other one?

182
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,900
Why are you up?

183
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,900
I'm fine.

184
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,400
You're badly injured.

185
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,900
Go back and lie down.

186
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,900
I was killed by the pharmacist.

187
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,400
It's not my fault.

188
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,900
I would've died in the cave.

189
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,900
But I'm begging you.

190
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,900
I'm begging you.

191
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,900
Please save my brother, okay?

192
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,400
My brother...

193
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,400
He's the best in the world.

194
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,400
He's the most kind person.

195
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,900
Chu Jing, you're not feeling well.

196
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,900
Get up and talk to me.

197
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,900
It's okay.

198
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,900
I'm used to the pain.

199
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,900
I'm used to kneeling down.

200
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,400
Okay.

201
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,400
Then let's listen to what you have to say.

202
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,400
How did you and Wu meet?

203
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:23,900
Do you know

204
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,900
what Chu Jing means?

205
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,900
You're afraid to plant a long-term plant in the mine?

206
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:36,900
Are you trying to kill someone?

207
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,400
Are you trying to escape?

208
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,900
No.

209
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,900
I don't know what this is.

210
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,900
I just want to plant something.

211
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,900
This is the only thing I can find here.

212
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,900
I think you're not going to see the coffin and not going to cry.

213
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,900
Keep hitting!

214
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,900
Stop!

215
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,900
This is not a long-term plant.

216
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,900
This is not a long-term plant.

217
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,900
It just looks like a long-term plant.

218
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,900
You can go now.

219
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,900
Yes, sir.

220
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,900
What are you looking at?

221
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,900
Let's go.

222
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,900
Get out of here!

223
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,900
What's your name?

224
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,900
Chu Jing.

225
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,900
My name is Chu Jing.

226
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,900
I'm a spirit who lives in the cave.

227
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,900
I'm responsible for the spirit energy of the Gan Di.

228
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,900
Chu Jing?

229
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,900
Do you know what Chu Jing means?

230
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,900
I don't know.

231
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,900
This flower is called the Sun Flower.

232
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:08,900
Chu Jing means the sun.

233
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,900
I've checked.

234
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,900
When your mother was pregnant with you, she was caught in the cave.

235
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,900
You were born in the cave, right?

236
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,900
Chu Jing means the sun.

237
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:35,900
You've never seen the sun in your life.

238
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,900
What are you thinking?

239
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:56,900
I'm thinking...

240
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,900
There's no rain in the cave.

241
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,900
And you have no water to drink.

242
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,900
How can you let them live so well?

243
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,900
Brother Xiao Wu, let me tell you a secret.

244
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:26,900
Chu Jing.

245
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:27,900
Chu Jing.

246
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,900
Chu Jing.

247
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,900
Chu Jing.

248
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,900
Chu Jing.

249
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,900
Chu Jing.

250
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:32,900
Chu Jing.

251
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:33,900
Chu Jing.

252
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:34,900
Chu Jing.

253
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:35,900
Chu Jing.

254
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,900
Chu Jing.

255
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,900
Chu Jing.

256
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,900
Chu Jing.

257
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,900
Chu Jing.

258
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,900
Chu Jing.

259
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,900
Chu Jing.

260
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,900
Chu Jing.

261
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:43,900
Chu Jing.

262
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,900
Chu Jing.

263
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,900
Chu Jing.

264
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,900
Chu Jing.

265
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,900
Chu Jing.

266
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,900
Chu Jing.

267
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,900
Chu Jing.

268
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,900
Chu Jing.

269
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:51,900
Chu Jing.

270
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,900
Chu Jing.

271
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:53,900
Chu Jing.

272
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,900
You can control the wind and rain?

273
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,900
Isn't this the magic of the dragon tribe?

274
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,900
We are the spirits of the forest.

275
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,900
We are born from the spirit of the heaven and earth.

276
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,900
We can do some magic.

277
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,900
Although we are not as good as the dragon tribe,

278
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,900
my mother...

279
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,900
My mother told me before she died that

280
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,900
she was originally a priest.

281
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,900
She has a very powerful power.

282
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,900
Will it snow?

283
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,900
It's hard to snow.

284
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,900
Even my mother can't do it.

285
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,900
It's a pity.

286
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,900
I grew up in the south.

287
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,900
I have a wish in my life.

288
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,900
I want to see the snow.

289
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,900
I can try.

290
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,900
Chu Jing.

291
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:50,900
Chu Jing.

292
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,900
Chu Jing.

293
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,900
Chu Jing.

294
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:53,900
Chu Jing.

295
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,900
Chu Jing.

296
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,900
Chu Jing.

297
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,900
Chu Jing.

298
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,900
Chu Jing.

299
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,900
Chu Jing.

300
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,900
Chu Jing.

301
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,900
Chu Jing.

302
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,900
Chu Jing.

303
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,900
Chu Jing.

304
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:03,900
Chu Jing.

305
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,900
Chu Jing.

306
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,900
Chu Jing.

307
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,900
Chu Jing.

308
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:07,900
Chu Jing.

309
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,900
Chu Jing.

310
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:09,900
Chu Jing.

311
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,900
Chu Jing.

312
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,900
Chu Jing.

313
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,900
Chu Jing.

314
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,900
Chu Jing.

315
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:14,900
Chu Jing.

316
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,900
Chu Jing.

317
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,900
Chu Jing.

318
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:17,900
Chu Jing.

319
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,900
Chu Jing.

320
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,900
The spirit demon lives on the spirit energy of heaven and earth.

321
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,900
It won't live long if it's locked up in the mine.

322
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,900
It'll die if it doesn't live.

323
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:36,900
Let's find someone to check the mine.

324
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,900
The demon's life...

325
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,900
is not life.

326
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:48,900
Mo Ren Zhi.

327
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,900
I'm warning you.

328
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,900
The human and demon's grudges are not fair.

329
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,900
The spirit demon is a big taboo of Yi Qi Sect.

330
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:02,900
These demons were bought from the Department of Chicken and Tea.

331
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,900
They are all registered in the Soul Heaven.

332
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,900
Don't try to do anything wrong.

333
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,900
Take your medicine.

334
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:21,900
When you're better,

335
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:25,900
we still have a lot to learn from Chu Jing.

336
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,900
After you leave,

337
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,900
make sure you make a good medicine.

338
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,900
Brother Xiao Wu.

339
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,900
Chu Jing...

340
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,900
You can't get out of here.

341
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,900
My parents left me...

342
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,900
after the bloodthirsty attack.

343
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,900
Chu Jing...

344
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,900
You can't see the sun anymore.

345
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,900
But, Brother Xiao Wu,

346
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,900
you can...

347
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,900
You can see the snow.

348
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,900
The handful of cultivationary silk for you.

349
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,900
Someone left it to you.

350
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,900
I know you'll take care of it.

351
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,900
You don't escaping to soy milk soybeans.

352
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:32,900
I'll go and take care of it.

353
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,900
Don't stay up late!

354
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,900
both of you!

355
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,900
Don't eat real الش sisterns like me.

356
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,900
She will nothing without money.

357
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,900
Generally...

358
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,760
That is why I said that.

359
00:21:47,140 --> 00:22:07,740
Stone waslights and

360
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:11,740
Pick one randomly and kill him.

361
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,740
No, I can't.

362
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,740
I can't kill anyone.

363
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:34,740
Pick one randomly and kill him.

364
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,740
You're here to sell vegetables.

365
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,740
You're here to sell your ass.

366
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:53,740
Please, get out of my way.

367
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,740
I don't want to hurt you.

368
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,740
What are you talking about?

369
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,740
Do you want to die?

370
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,740
No, I can't.

371
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,740
Kill him.

372
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,740
Do it.

373
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,740
Run!

374
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,740
Run!

375
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,740
Run!

376
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,740
You're a monster.

377
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,740
Come with me.

378
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:18,740
Run!

379
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,740
Chase him!

380
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:23,740
I can't resist the demon talisman.

381
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,740
Don't worry.

382
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,740
I destroyed half of the talisman.

383
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,740
Now I have it.

384
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,740
It's like a mountain in the iron.

385
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:31,740
They can't escape.

386
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,740
What about Brother Xiao Wu?

387
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,740
He's dead.

388
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,740
What about Brother Xiao Wu?

389
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,740
He said Brother Xiao Wu was caught.

390
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,740
When Brother Xiao Wu let me go,

391
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,740
he promised me

392
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:47,740
that he wouldn't be found out.

393
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,740
Although Mu Xiao Wu was born in a poor family,

394
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,740
he was willing to do it.

395
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:55,740
He became the captain of the mine when he was young.

396
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,740
Many people envied him.

397
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:00,740
Your story was reported.

398
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,740
How could it be?

399
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,740
Brother Xiao Wu can't die.

400
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,740
He has a beautiful fiancee.

401
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,740
How can I save him?

402
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,740
I can go back to the mine.

403
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,740
Please send me back to the mine.

404
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,740
Chu Jing.

405
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,740
You won't go back to the mine.

406
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:24,740
I'll protect your brother.

407
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,740
Okay?

408
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,740
Really?

409
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,740
It's a deal.

410
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,740
I'll go back to the mine.

411
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,740
Okay?

412
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,740
I'll go back to the mine.

413
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,740
Okay?

414
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,740
I'll go back to the mine.

415
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,740
Okay?

416
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,740
I'll go back to the mine.

417
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,740
Okay?

418
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,740
I'll go back to the mine.

419
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,740
Okay?

420
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,740
I'll go back to the mine.

421
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:58,740
Okay?

422
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,740
I'll go back to the mine.

423
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,740
Okay?

424
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:08,740
I'll go back to the mine.

425
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,740
Okay?

426
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,740
Have you seen Chu Jing H Charm?

427
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,740
What's her purpose of going to the mine?

428
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,740
Stopoffs.

429
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,740
What's the purpose of leaving her at our city?

430
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,740
We might just follow the whining officer.

431
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,740
So, put yourself in and nothing can go wrong anymore.

432
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,740
I said that?

433
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,740
That...

434
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,740
I won't go to the mine.

435
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,740
I'm not your brother.

436
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,240
I have no choice.

437
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,580
Nangong is in danger.

438
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:36,160
I have to send Mu Xiaowu there tonight.

439
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,040
Otherwise, the relationship between her and our family

440
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,960
will be completely cut off.

441
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,120
You know that

442
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,540
although Nangong family lost its business,

443
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,660
they still have a lot of wealth.

444
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,300
We can't afford to lose them.

445
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,660
Brother,

446
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:51,720
Young Master Wang Quan won't let you go.

447
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,760
He's just a captain of Kuangdong.

448
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,760
He won't die if he's sent there.

449
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,560
Why won't Young Master Wang Quan let go of Yang Zan?

450
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,720
There's still one more detective.

451
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,340
Brother.

452
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:08,100
Brother.

453
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,020
No.

454
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,680
No.

455
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,940
Brother.

456
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,560
Brother, don't do this.

457
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,480
Xiaowu. Xiaowu.

458
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,860
Xiaowu.

459
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,700
Let go of me.

460
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,200
Xiaowu.

461
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,900
I really don't understand.

462
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:32,020
What's so good about this poor kid?

463
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,400
You're so cruel to him.

464
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,200
I want to see my father.

465
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,900
I want to see my father.

466
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,160
Brother.

467
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,080
Brother.

468
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,900
Do you really think I won't let you go

469
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,660
because you don't have my permission?

470
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,660
You think I'll send you to the police?

471
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,260
The man and the jade talisman

472
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:06,520
were all taken away by Wang Quan and Hongye.

473
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:10,560
Isn't this just sending the evidence to both hands

474
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,900
and waiting for him to come and get us in trouble?

475
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,860
Master.

476
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,400
That little demon was so badly injured.

477
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,740
He won't come back so soon.

478
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:21,740
Thanks to the Yang family for sending us such a big gift.

479
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,240
We still have a chance.

480
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,500
What chance?

481
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,660
We can ask this kid

482
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,860
for the evidence that the Yang family and the demon family colluded.

483
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,820
When the meeting of the Yiqi Alliance comes,

484
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:34,120
we can beat Wang Quan's family.

485
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:38,020
We can see what the hell Wang Quan and Hongye are up to.

486
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,020
We can also ask Wang Quan's family

487
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,020
what their position is.

488
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:45,500
He's against the demon elixir and the jade talisman.

489
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,020
Is he trying to kill the demon?

490
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,060
Good idea.

491
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,120
Guards.

492
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,120
Take him away.

493
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,920
Master Nangong.

494
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,820
I usually wake people up.

495
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,820
I don't need water.

496
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,420
Master Nangong.

497
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,420
I'm sorry.

498
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:04,420
I'm sorry.

499
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,420
I'm sorry.

500
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,420
I'm sorry.

501
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,420
I'm sorry.

502
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,420
I'm sorry.

503
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,420
I'm sorry.

504
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:16,420
I'm sorry.

505
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,420
I'm sorry.

506
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,420
I'm sorry.

507
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,420
I'm sorry.

508
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,420
I'm sorry.

509
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,420
I'm sorry.

510
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:29,180
I'm sorry.

511
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:59,180
Master Nangong.

512
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:12,180
You gave him 10 times to turn at나

513
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:14,180
I told you.

514
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:20,180
There's no hope now.

515
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:22,180
Whatever you do,

516
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,180
I won't ease it.

517
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,180
Why would I ask?

518
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:28,180
I forgot.

519
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,180
Chu Qing,

520
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,180
he will never kill anyone.

521
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:34,180
You let the little demon go,

522
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:38,180
was it the order from the Yang family?

523
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:41,180
Of course not.

524
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:53,180
The question I asked you,

525
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:55,180
you only need to answer one question.

526
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,180
Do you understand?

527
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,180
Brother Shao Wu...

528
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,180
I saw you.

529
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,180
Wang Quan and Yi Yan.

530
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:59,180
The success you've been waiting for.

531
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,180
All the struggles are for the same purpose.

532
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,180
Who are you?

533
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,180
I...

534
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:07,180
I am Yong Ni.

535
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:11,180
That tree is getting bigger and bigger.

536
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:13,180
Yong Ni...

537
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:15,180
I...

538
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,180
I'm Yong Ni.

539
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:21,180
Yong Ni,

540
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:25,180
is Yong Ni getting closer and closer?

541
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:27,180
What is this place?

542
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:29,180
Father,

543
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:31,180
where are you?

544
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,180
This place is so simple.

545
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:39,180
Young Master didn't sleep well last night.

546
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,180
He must have had a nightmare.

547
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:47,180
I gave him some medicine to help him sleep.

548
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,180
He won't wake up easily.

549
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:51,180
He won't wake up easily.

550
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,180
In Chu Jing's life,

551
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:08,180
there are not many people who are willing to make promises to him.

552
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:11,180
That's why he is so cautious of Young Master.

553
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:16,180
I didn't expect Mu Xiao Wu to be so warm.

554
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,180
Yan said,

555
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:22,180
he is a man who always keeps his word.

556
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:26,180
He always does his best in everything he does.

557
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:29,180
No matter what happens,

558
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,180
as long as you see him,

559
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:33,180
you feel like you are back home.

560
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:36,180
He always puts you first.

561
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:38,180
He always makes you happy.

562
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:40,180
In this world,

563
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:43,180
how many people can be so caring?

564
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:46,180
Being a gentle person

565
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:48,180
is also a kind of luck.

566
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:55,180
Don't worry.

567
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:57,180
When he wakes up,

568
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,180
we will go back to the police station.

569
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,180
I will definitely save Mu Xiao Wu.

570
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,180
I'll change the medicine for Young Master.

571
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:07,180
The wound is fine now.

572
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:10,180
But you might have to leave a scar in the future.

573
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:12,180
No.

574
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,180
There is one more thing.

575
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,180
I'll help you

576
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,180
to get rid of the poison on your body.

577
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,180
Now?

578
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,180
You are injured.

579
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:28,180
I'll help you.

580
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:30,180
I'll help you.

581
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:32,180
I'll help you.

582
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:34,180
I'll help you.

583
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:37,180
I'll help you.

584
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,180
It's done.

585
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:48,180
It's done?

586
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:51,180
Last time, I gave you a gold flower bowl.

587
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:58,180
I'm happy that I'm not feeling sick.

588
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,180
I feel better.

589
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,180
You are kind

590
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:04,180
and you didn't lie to me.

591
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:06,180
You are threatening me.

592
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:10,180
After all, you are the Young Master of Wang Quan.

593
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,180
Then why are you

594
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:15,180
willing to help me get rid of the poison?

595
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:17,180
Because you

596
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:19,180
are different

597
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:21,180
from what I thought.

598
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,180
Then is the me in your heart

599
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:29,180
the same as the me in your sister's heart?

600
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:35,180
At least not now.

601
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:37,180
When this is over,

602
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:40,180
I'll make up for the wine I owe you.

603
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:42,180
Then I'll just

604
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:46,180
treat it as a change in your heart.

605
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:50,180
The medicine is almost ready.

606
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:52,180
When you wake up,

607
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:55,180
you'll be able to take the medicine.

608
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:58,180
You should rest for a while.

609
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:04,180
I'll be back.

610
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:13,180
This child is still coughing.

611
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:15,180
This is a cold medicine.

612
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,180
It's very effective.

613
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:19,180
Take it home.

614
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:35,180
What is this?

615
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,180
Move.

616
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:07,180
I want to see Mu Ren Zhi.

617
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,180
Mu Ren Zhi is a major criminal in the Bureau of Investigation.

618
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:11,180
You can see him as you want.

619
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:19,180
Move!

620
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,180
I'm Mu Ren Zhi's wife.

621
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:28,180
What crime did he commit?

622
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:30,180
Let me in.

623
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:32,180
Let me in.

624
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:34,180
I want to be with him.

625
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:36,180
The owner said that

626
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,180
no one is allowed to enter before the criminal is asked.

627
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:46,180
Move!

628
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:48,180
Move!

629
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,180
Move!

630
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:52,180
Move!

631
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:00,180
If you keep messing around,

632
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,180
I'll never see him again.

633
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:22,180
Move!

634
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:34,180
The Yang family...

635
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:36,180
Why did you let me go out?

636
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,180
Because you're a monster.

637
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:40,180
Not only the Yang family,

638
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:42,180
but also the Wang Quan family.

639
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,180
I'll go to the Yan family

640
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:55,180
and make a promise to him

641
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:58,180
that I'll make him happy.

642
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:00,180
Why are you telling me these nonsense?

643
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:05,180
If the Yang family is in trouble,

644
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:08,180
Yan won't be happy.

645
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:12,180
Even though I'm a poor man,

646
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:15,180
I'll never be fooled.

647
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,180
I'm angry.

648
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:21,180
It seems that our guest

649
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:23,180
doesn't know much about the world.

650
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,180
How dare you!

651
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:42,180
I'll punish you severely!

652
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:44,180
Yes!

653
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:47,180
I'll punish you severely!

654
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:59,180
The Yang family is in trouble.

655
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:17,180
The Yang family is in trouble.

656
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,180
I'll punish you severely!

657
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:21,180
I'll punish you severely!

658
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:23,180
I'll punish you severely!

659
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,180

669
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:45,180

I'll punish you severely!

675
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:57,180
I'll punish you severely!

676
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:59,180
I'll punish you severely!

677
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:01,180
I'll punish you severely!

678
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:03,180

679
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:05,180
I'll punish you severely!

680
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:07,180
I'll punish you severely!

681
