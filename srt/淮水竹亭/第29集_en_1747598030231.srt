00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,140
ten million

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,160
Love and hate are both

3
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,040
Flowing and flowing

4
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,520
The wind blows

5
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,720
The sky is as clear as the sky

6
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,960
Don't turn back, keep walking

7
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,760
Life and death are in front of you

8
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,280
The past is in the past

9
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,560
Who's love

10
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,040
Is more vast than the universe

11
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,280
Don't turn back, keep walking

12
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,160
Life and death are in front of you

13
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,640
The past is in the past

14
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,880
Who's love

15
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,560
Is more vast than the universe

16
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,560
It's you and me

17
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,360
Love and hate are both

18
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,760
Flowing and flowing

19
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,880
The past is in the past

20
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,880
Episode 2

21
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,160
Father.

22
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,160
You finally found me.

23
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,160
Father, are you really outside the Quan River?

24
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,160
Tell me where you are. I'll go save you.

25
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:14,160
All along, I've been using the way of entering the dream

26
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,160
to communicate with you.

27
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,160
Father.

28
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,160
Listen to me first. Why am I here?

29
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,160
I'm here to save you.

30
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,160
Why am I here?

31
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,160
When you were 16 years old,

32
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,160
your uncle Yang He was the father of the detective.

33
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,160
He saw something horrible.

34
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,160
He said that he didn't know how to

35
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,160
connect the black love tree outside the Quan River

36
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,160
with the love tree in Mount Tushan.

37
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,160
Through the love tree in Mount Tushan,

38
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,160
the black fox was in the crazy and absorbed hatred.

39
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:59,160
Yang He used all his energy to open the heavenly eyes

40
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,160
and saw the weak link.

41
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,160
Outside the Quan River, I took the Wang Quan Sword

42
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,160
and came here.

43
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,160
Father.

44
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,160
Who is it?

45
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,160
After I cut off the link between the two love trees,

46
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,160
I was discovered by the black fox.

47
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,160
I found that I was not his opponent.

48
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,160
I could only hide myself in the dark.

49
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,160
I was so scared.

50
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,160
I was so scared.

51
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,160
I was so scared.

52
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,160
Either you or when you were 15.

53
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,160
I won, Serpentie,

54
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,160
I dont mind.

55
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,160
But my will power is very weak,

56
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,160
so every time I talked to you,

57
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,160
I used a very short time.

58
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,160
Yang He said that

59
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,160
every time,

60
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,000
you were tired of having君

61
00:04:48,000 --> 00:05:05,400
The connection between Datong and the

62
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,400
The connection between Datong and the

63
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,400
The connection between Datong and the

64
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,400
The connection between Datong and the

65
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,400
The connection between Datong and the

66
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,400
The connection between Datong and the

67
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,400
The connection between Datong and the

68
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,400
The connection between Datong and the

69
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,400
The connection between Datong and the

70
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,400
The connection between Datong and the

71
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,400
The connection between Datong and the

72
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,400
The connection between Datong and the

73
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,400
The connection between Datong and the

74
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,400
The connection between Datong and the

75
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,400
The connection between Datong and the

76
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,400
The connection between Datong and the

77
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,400
Kneel down

78
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:13,440
Department of弓

79
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:27,440
Hoar잉

80
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,440
Claire

81
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,440
I will be with you forever.

82
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,440
Wu Er Hong Ye,

83
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,440
from today on,

84
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,440
you must remember what I said.

85
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,440
Once you understand the sword of the Heaven and Earth,

86
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,440
Wang Quan Sword will come for you.

87
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,440
I finally know where my father is.

88
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,440
I also know that the final battle with the Black Tiger is approaching.

89
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,440
This battle

90
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,440
is not only for my father,

91
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,440
but also to change the ending of all people and demons.

92
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,440
And the brothers and sisters of the Mask Group

93
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,440
are also trying to unmask the mask of this world.

94
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,440
I will be with you forever.

95
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,440
I will be with you forever.

96
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:33,440
I also am preparing to unmask the mask of this world.

97
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,440
Who's every day is crazy?

98
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,440
Even if everything is ugly,

99
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,440
it will be destroyed.

100
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,440
You think I'm as good as a wild moon.

101
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,440
The rain falls,

102
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,440
tearing apart the dust.

103
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,440
The sword in my hand is open.

104
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,440
The flower of the dark sea

105
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,440
is like a butterfly.

106
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,440
The sky is like a paper.

107
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,440
I will be with you forever.

108
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,440
Your Highness,

109
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,440
the time has come for the Heaven Dog to reconnect the bitter love tree.

110
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,440
Your Highness, please forgive me.

111
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,440
Your Highness,

112
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,440
do you think it's possible to do it only with Lord Jiuhuo?

113
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,440
Uncle Shouzhuo went to the outside of the circle

114
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,440
to cut off the connection of the bitter love tree.

115
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:17,440
Your father was entrusted by my father

116
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,440
to use all his spiritual power to open the Heaven Dog.

117
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,440
He saw the weakness of the two trees.

118
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,440
So the reason why Uncle Yang couldn't get up

119
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,440
was because...

120
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,440
Yitan,

121
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,440
I'm sorry.

122
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,440
Why are you sorry?

123
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,440
In life,

124
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,440
we can have a friend.

125
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,440
When we are happy, we drink together.

126
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,440
When we are in trouble, we die together.

127
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,440
How lucky we are!

128
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,440
When my father left,

129
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,440
I was by his side.

130
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,440
He left with a smile.

131
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,440
So I guess he didn't have any regrets.

132
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,440
By the way, Brother,

133
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,440
you just said that

134
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,440
the two bitter love trees are the easiest to reconnect before and after sunset.

135
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,440
I'm observing the sky.

136
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,440
There will be sunset in a few days.

137
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,440
I'll go to the nearby place.

138
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,440
Okay. I'll go with you.

139
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,440
Okay.

140
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,440
There must be flowers in the worship ceremony.

141
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,440
And

142
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,440
Yitan's mother must be very beautiful.

143
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,440
Actually, you don't have to come.

144
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,440
Just go to the mountain and wait for me.

145
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,440
Okay.

146
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,440
Do you know what it means?

147
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,440
I know.

148
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,440
We are a family.

149
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,440
I'm the one who is in love with you.

150
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,440
That's more like it.

151
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,440
Miss Wang Quan is here.

152
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,440
Hello, Grandpa.

153
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,440
We just made the morning cake.

154
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,440
Would you like to try it?

155
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,440
Okay.

156
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,440
I'll try it.

157
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,440
Then you and Yitan

158
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,440
can have a good chat.

159
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,440
Okay.

160
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,440
Why are you thinking about your parents?

161
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,440
Yitan,

162
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,440
I've made many mistakes before.

163
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,440
Anyway,

164
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,440
the Yang family is in your hands.

165
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,440
I don't regret it.

166
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,440
Grandpa,

167
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,440
I know my father's death.

168
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,440
That's the truth.

169
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,440
Grandpa,

170
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,440
my father and Uncle Shouzhuo

171
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,440
guarded the whole world together.

172
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,440
If it weren't for them,

173
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,440
Yongye might have been dead long ago.

174
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,440
Yes.

175
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,440
Wang Quan and Shouzhuo

176
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:39,940
found the

177
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,440
aura of the outside world.

178
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,440
So they asked

179
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,440
He'er to open the heavenly eyes.

180
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,440
He'er opened the heavenly eyes?

181
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,440
Yes.

182
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,440
Why?

183
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,440
Wang Quan's master is the leader of the Yiqi Sect.

184
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,440
He wants to live alone.

185
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,440
Why did he take He'er away?

186
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,440
Grandpa,

187
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,440
what?

188
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,440
Did I say something wrong?

189
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,440
In this world,

190
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,440
no one lives to live alone.

191
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,440
Because there is a rich family of Wang Quan

192
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,440
in the Yiqi Sect.

193
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,440
It's so expensive.

194
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,440
Of course he can risk his life to protect it.

195
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,440
But what does the Yang family have?

196
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,440
Nothing.

197
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,440
In this world,

198
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,440
not only the fame and wealth,

199
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,440
if there is no money and power,

200
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,440
people live much better.

201
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,440
You will see all the hatred in this world.

202
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,440
Wang Quan and Hongye

203
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,440
are going to investigate the Black Lake?

204
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,440
Don't follow them.

205
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,440
You are the last hope of the Yang family.

206
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,440
I won't leave you alone.

207
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,440
Grandpa,

208
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,440
have a good rest.

209
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,440
Yitai.

210
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,440
I also represent the Yang family

211
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,440
to work with Wang Quan.

212
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,440
I will take care of the Yang family.

213
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,440
Grandpa,

214
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,440
you should rest for a long time.

215
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,440
I heard you had a fight with grandpa.

216
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,440
I thought

217
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,440
grandpa could understand my father.

218
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,440
Now I understand.

219
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,440
I don't know what to do.

220
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,440
I just want to be with him.

221
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,440
I want to be with him.

222
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,440
I want to be with him.

223
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,440
I want to be with him.

224
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,440
I want to be with him.

225
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,440
I want to be with him.

226
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,440
Now I understand.

227
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,440
Maybe my father knows my grandfather too well.

228
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,440
So I didn't tell him about this.

229
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,440
The Yang family

230
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,440
is really a bad luck.

231
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,440
Uncle Yang He,

232
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,440
Aunt Yang Yan,

233
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,440
and you

234
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,440
are all like pearls.

235
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,440
You Yang family

236
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,440
are not what you want.

237
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,440
I'm fine.

238
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,440
You don't have to be happy.

239
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,440
Uncle,

240
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,440
Aunt,

241
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,440
let me introduce myself.

242
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,440
I am Wang Quanzui.

243
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,440
I will take care of Yitan

244
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,440
from now on.

245
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,440
Don't worry.

246
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,440
I am a good girl.

247
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,440
I will help Yitan

248
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,440
to make her happy.

249
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,440
I will help her

250
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,440
with everything.

251
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,440
Master,

252
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,440
you are here.

253
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,440
This is the jewel

254
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,440
from Ruyi House.

255
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,440
You can pick some

256
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,440
and use them for your wedding.

257
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,440
Don't call me master anymore.

258
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,440
Put down your things and get out.

259
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,440
I will go.

260
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,440
Long time no see.

261
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,440
I thought Yang Yitan

262
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,440
took Wang Quanzui.

263
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,440
Your family

264
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,440
can be in a good position from now on.

265
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,440
You are so stupid, Yang Huanzhou.

266
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,440
Yang He was killed by Wang Quan.

267
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,440
Yang Ying has gone.

268
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,440
Yang Yitan

269
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,440
will also step on

270
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,440
this piece of ash soon.

271
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,440
Our family

272
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,440
is the sacrifice of Wang Quan.

273
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,440
You finally understand.

274
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,440
After you marry Wang Quanzui,

275
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,440
your family will be

276
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,440
the rich and powerful

277
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,440
of Wang Quan.

278
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,440
Until they

279
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,440
eat you up.

280
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,440
Look.

281
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,440
It's said that the bitter love tree is very famous.

282
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,440
Yes.

283
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,440
Yitan, look.

284
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,440
Bitter love tree.

285
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,440
So beautiful.

286
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,440
If people

287
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,440
can also

288
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,440
live in the bitter love tree

289
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,440
and live in the virtual world,

290
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,440
that's good.

291
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,440
There is only one life in the human clan.

292
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,440
It's good to have no regrets for life.

293
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,440
You don't understand romance at all.

294
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,440
You are right.

295
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,440
Do you want to use it?

296
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,440
Our red thread of Tushan, Xu Wenjie.

297
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,440
Red thread of Tushan, Xu Wenjie.

298
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,440
Do you want one?

299
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,440
No.

300
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,440
Mr. Liang,

301
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,440
do you want to have

302
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,440
our red thread of Tushan, Xu Wenjie?

303
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,440
It's very good.

304
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,440
What's that?

305
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,440
Red thread of Tushan, Xu Wenjie.

306
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,440
This

307
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,440
was opened by our boss, Tushan.

308
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,440
It's very good.

309
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,440
Boss Tushan

310
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,440
has this business?

311
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,440
Of course.

312
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,440
Let me tell you.

313
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,440
Come on.

314
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,440
Tell me.

315
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,440
Do you see my red wound?

316
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,440
Why is it so red?

317
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,440
That's because

318
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,440
the flower juice on the bitter love tree

319
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,440
is stained, you know?

320
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,440
I usually don't tell him.

321
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,440
Look.

322
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,440
Tushan never allows people to enter.

323
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,440
Where did you get this bitter love flower?

324
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,440
This...

325
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,440
It's from Dafeng.

326
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,440
Brother,

327
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,440
you're so serious.

328
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,440
How can people do business?

329
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,440
Yes.

330
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,440
Give me the money.

331
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,440
Your name is...

332
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,440
Red thread of Tushan, Xu Wenjie.

333
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,440
Xu Wenjie.

334
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,440
Yes.

335
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,440
We'll buy it.

336
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,440
Thank you.

337
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,440
Thank you.

338
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,440
Give me the money.

339
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,440
Hurry up.

340
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,440
Thank you.

341
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,440
Thank you.

342
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,440
Enjoy.

343
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,440
Wait.

344
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,440
You believe in this?

345
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,440
They sell love.

346
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,440
It's a story.

347
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,440
We sell stories.

348
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,440
You red thread of Tushan

349
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,440
can't be picked up when you get home.

350
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,440
You know?

351
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,440
If you two can stay together

352
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,440
and spend a night together,

353
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,440
I promise you two will be together forever.

354
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,440
You know?

355
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,440
You two will be together forever.

356
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,440
You two will be together forever.

357
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,440
You two will be together forever.

358
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,440
You two will be together forever.

359
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,440
You know?

360
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,440
You believe in this kind of lie?

361
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,440
I'd rather believe in it

362
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,440
than believe in it.

363
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,440
You believe in it?

364
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,440
No.

365
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,440
I believe in you.

366
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,440
I believe in you.

367
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,440
Yes.

368
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,440
Yitan,

369
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,440
don't go anywhere tonight.

370
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,440
Stay and stay with me.

371
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,440
All right.

372
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,240
空中下的白紅髓

373
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,920
在白空上才發現

374
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,440
誰在 transfer out of the two

375
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:42,220
聽 演唱 chilling tears

376
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,600
這輩子的美畫

377
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,640
就只有你

378
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:50,880
但是挺吵鬧

379
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,880
I'm not afraid of you.

380
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,880
I'm not afraid of you.

381
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,880
I'm not afraid of you.

382
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,880
I'm not afraid of you.

383
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,880
I'm not afraid of you.

384
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,880
I'm not afraid of you.

385
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,880
I'm not afraid of you.

386
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,880
No matter how we face each other.

387
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,880
No matter the soul determines eternity.

388
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,880
True love is like sugar falling in the wind.

389
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,880
How do you feel?

390
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,880
No matter how we meet.

391
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,880
No matter the four seasons.

392
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:41,880
Maybe we can be together even if we miss each other.

393
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,880
I went to check the love letter.

394
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,880
I didn't wake you up and I didn't call you.

395
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,880
I got a letter.

396
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,880
I got the red thread after dawn.

397
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,880
Poieszka

398
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,880
farms

399
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,880
Sui

400
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,880
A'Cui!

401
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,880
A'Cui!

402
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,880
A'Cui!

403
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,880
A'Cui!

404
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,880
A'Cui!

405
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,880
Yi Tan.

406
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,880
Who are you?

407
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,880
Grandpa?

408
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,880
A'Cui!

409
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,880
A'Cui!

410
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,880
A'Cui!

411
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,880
When the sun rises,

412
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,880
if the dark and dark love trees outside the circle

413
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,880
and the dark and dark love trees inside the circle

414
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,880
are both activated,

415
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,880
the two trees will be connected.

416
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,880
From now on,

417
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,880
I will absorb the power of the dark and dark love trees.

418
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,880
The circle will be ready in a few days.

419
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,880
Dark and dark love trees

420
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,880
are the best for killing the evil in the world.

421
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,880
They will break all the light.

422
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,880
Grandpa!

423
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,880
I heard from my brother

424
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,880
that the person who released the fire in the underground palace

425
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,880
and the person who released the fire

426
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,880
is always this way.

427
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,880
Yi Tan,

428
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,880
come back to the dark with me.

429
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,880
The Black Fire will give us everything

430
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,880
and share the world with us.

431
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,880
Kill Wang Quanzui.

432
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,880
Don't be a slave of Wang Quan's family anymore.

433
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,880
I will sacrifice my life

434
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,880
to find the light of the world

435
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,880
and bring the darkness back to me.

436
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,880
I love you so much.

437
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,880
You should be careful from now on.

438
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,880
Why

439
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,880
You're good.

440
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,880
You're good for me.

441
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,880
Your blood is so weak.

442
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,880
Your family is good for me.

443
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,880
You're the late emperor.

444
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,880
You're good for me.

445
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,880
You're good for me.

446
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,880
You're good for me.

447
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,880
Now,

448
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,880
you're the one who killed my mother.

449
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,880
It's all for me.

450
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,880
The Yang family

451
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,880
shouldn't be the only one who's under the control.

452
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,880
You killed your father

453
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,880
and forced your aunt to leave.

454
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,880
Now you're the one who's going to be his dog.

455
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,880
I'll do it anyway.

456
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,880
It's me who's in the Yang family.

457
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,880
Look at you.

458
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,880
You're so ugly.

459
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,880
So,

460
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,880
you have hatred in your heart.

461
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,880
But this hatred

462
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,880
is far from enough.

463
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,880
Why don't you kill me now?

464
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,880
If you can't kill me,

465
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:49,880
I won't let Wang Quan die.

466
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,880
Zui,

467
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,880
you're the daughter-in-law of the Yang family.

468
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,880
Today,

469
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,880
you can help our family.

470
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,880
This is the power of hatred.

471
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,880
What's the use of love?

472
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,880
Love can only be your weakness.

473
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,880
Only hatred

474
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,880
can give you infinite power.

475
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,880
Yang Yitan,

476
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,880
kill him

477
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,880
to save your Wang Quanzui.

478
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,880
Kill him.

479
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:29,880
You're the strongest one in the Yiqi Alliance.

480
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,880
I'm going to kill you.

481
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,880
I'm going to kill you.

482
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,880
I'm going to kill you.

483
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,880
I'm going to kill you.

484
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,880
I'm going to kill you.

485
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,880
I'm going to kill you.

486
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,880
Your Heaven is bigger than the world around you.

487
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,880
Yang Yitan,

488
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,880
I should have.

489
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,880
Ye Tan,

490
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,880
I've sacrificed myself today

491
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:23,880
to return your power of the five realms.

492
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,880
One day,

493
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:31,880
I was taught by the Yang family

494
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,880
by a man

495
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,880
who can't even

496
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,880
look at us.

497
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,880
Ye Tan,

498
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,880
you're just a man.

499
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,880
You can't do anything.

500
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,880
You're just a man.

501
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,880
You're just a man.

502
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,880
You're just a man.

503
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,880
Ye Tan,

504
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,880
I'm sorry.

505
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,880
I'm sorry.

506
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,880
Ye Tan,

507
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,880
I'm sorry.

508
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,880
I'm sorry.

509
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,880
I'm sorry.

510
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,880
No.

511
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,880
No.

512
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,880
No.

513
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,880
No.

514
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,880
No.

515
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,880
No.

516
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,880
九霍大人

517
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,180
九霍大人

518
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:36,180
我来了

519
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,000
Absolutely not 68

520
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,200
Even if they die today

521
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,080
I still want to make the journey to the rage

522
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:40,880
Brother Yi.

523
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,480
Brother Yi.

524
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,680
Brother Yi.

525
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,680
A'Cui.

526
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,880
A'Cui.

527
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,680
This iron...

528
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,680
This iron...

529
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,680
This iron...

530
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,880
This iron...

531
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,880
Wu Qingshuang.

532
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,880
Let's go.

533
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,880
Let's go.

534
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,880
Let's go.

535
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,880
Young Master.

536
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,880
The friends who came to the ceremony

537
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,880
were sent away.

538
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,880
Young Master Wang Quan is staying.

539
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,880
He's taking care of Miss Wang Quan.

540
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,880
How is A'Cui?

541
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,880
She's all right.

542
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,960
They said they would return to Mount Wangquan tomorrow.

543
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:18,760
You may leave.

544
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,480
Yes.

545
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,160
Brother.

546
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:40,960
Yi Tan.

547
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,240
Just think of it as

548
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,960
giving her the last ride.

549
00:36:37,880 --> 00:37:00,200
Have a discussion, I can do it without concerns for me to make a о officially Biochemicaldess biarshmont, I want to thank you

550
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:21,820
putting one could be enough to condone fibre irks and

551
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:25,740
air dirty.

552
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:28,520
I don't know why.

553
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:31,600
I can do anything for Xiaomei.

554
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:42,560
But after I met you, everything changed.

555
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,920
Xiaomei smiled more and more every day.

556
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:51,840
She also came to me crying in the middle of the night.

557
00:37:51,840 --> 00:38:04,840
Ever since then, I've known that there's another person in this world who loves her as much as I do.

558
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:16,600
And then, you not only became my brother, but also became my family.

559
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:25,080
You helped me to fulfill my dream, form the Masked Brigade, and have new siblings.

560
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:34,640
Sun Yitang, I want to thank you.

561
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:43,080
You must remember, no matter what happens in the future, don't be afraid.

562
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,360
I'm your family.

563
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,840
I'll always be here for you.

564
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,080
Xiaomei is here.

565
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,880
Don't let her worry.

566
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,360
It's cold. Go home early.

567
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:27,360
A'Cui, I'm sorry.

568
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,880
It's not your fault.
