2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,840
Love is like a flame

3
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:11,680
The wind blows the sky like a wind

4
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,920
Don't look back, keep going

5
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,760
Life goes on

6
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,280
From the fire to the fire

7
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,400
Whose love

8
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,040
is more tortuous than the universe

9
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,280
Don't look back, keep going

10
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,120
Life goes on

11
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,600
From the fire to the fire

12
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,840
Whose love

13
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,560
is more tortuous than the universe

14
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,560
It's me

15
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,920
The Long Ballad

16
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,160
The rain of cherry blossoms is really refreshing

17
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,920
The real fruit invites you to watch the water-burning bamboo garden

18
00:01:59,360 --> 00:01:59,880
Woo!

19
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,160
What is going on?

20
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,160
The gate of our manor is opened

21
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,760
The sword investiment

22
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,120
How dare you trespass the mountain villa?

23
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,120
Do you want to die?

24
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,120
How dare you!

25
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,120
What are you doing here?

26
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,120
You won't tell me?

27
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,120
Then you're just going to kill yourself.

28
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,120
Kill!

29
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,120
You have quite some power.

30
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,120
I'm going to kill you.

31
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,120
What a pity.

32
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,120
Your sword skills are not good.

33
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,120
I can't beat your sword skills.

34
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,120
What else do you want to say?

35
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,120
Say it.

36
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,120
Go to hell!

37
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,120
I'm sorry.

38
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,120
This sword is...

39
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,120
Wang Quan?

40
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,120
That's right.

41
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,120
This is the Sword of Wang Quan,

42
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,120
the Sword of Heaven and Earth.

43
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,120
It's beautiful.

44
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,120
It's beautiful.

45
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,120
It's beautiful.

46
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,120
It's beautiful.

47
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,120
It's beautiful.

48
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,120
The wind and thunder.

49
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,120
The four great guardians of this Wang Quan Villa

50
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,120
have also come to join the fun.

51
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,120
I dare not.

52
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,120
In front of the Sword of Heaven and Earth,

53
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,120
we are just swordsmen.

54
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,120
So the enemy of Wang Quan Sword

55
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,120
is our enemy.

56
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,120
Just you guys?

57
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,120
Am I afraid?

58
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,120
Of course you're not afraid.

59
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,120
Back then,

60
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,120
the Eastern heroes were blessed with talents

61
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,120
and created the God Fire Villa with their own strength.

62
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,120
They even married Wang Quan Villa.

63
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,120
Our old masters

64
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,120
have always been fond of the Eastern heroes.

65
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,120
That's right.

66
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,120
So even if the wind and thunder

67
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,120
are together,

68
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,120
as the Eastern heroes' great disciples,

69
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,120
what's the fear?

70
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,120
I'm not afraid.

71
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,120
I'm not afraid.

72
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,120
Waste of time.

73
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,120
That's me.

74
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,120
It seems that today,

75
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,120
Wang Quan Villa

76
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,120
is going to interfere with the content of my God Fire Villa.

77
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,120
It's different from the past.

78
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,120
Do you think I'll give you face?

79
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,120
It depends on how determined you are.

80
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,120
Although our Wang Quan Villa

81
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,120
doesn't have such outstanding talents like Mr. Jin,

82
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,120
if we really want to get something,

83
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,120
I'm afraid Mr. Jin

84
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,120
will have to be like the old masters in the East,

85
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,120
and do nothing.

86
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,120
Good.

87
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,120
Not only are the four great masters

88
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,120
but also the young masters are here.

89
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,120
What do you want to do?

90
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,120
It seems that Mr. Jin has some misunderstandings about us.

91
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,120
We are just here to marry.

92
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,120
I'm not afraid.

93
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,120
When did I get married to you?

94
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,120
The eight great masters are waiting outside.

95
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,120
Wang Quan Villa is in the Qing Dynasty.

96
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,120
I think I'm joking.

97
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,120
I don't think it's necessary to get married.

98
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,120
Our master is just here to marry

99
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,120
the cousin of Mr. Jin,

100
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,120
the first day she was pregnant.

101
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,120
What a good way to show off.

102
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,120
What a good Wang Quan Villa.

103
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,120
You are obviously a man of great power.

104
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,120
To be honest,

105
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,120
although you are a man of great power,

106
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,120
none of the people who are here today

107
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:09,120
can marry me.

108
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,120
Besides, you have a lot of people in Wang Quan Villa.

109
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,120
I have a lot of people in the life of the Villa.

110
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,120
You...

111
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,120
You are right.

112
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,120
Mr. Jin is the most powerful man

113
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,120
in the Dao Sect.

114
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,120
And I heard that

115
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,120
Mr. Jin also got the secret magic of the fire

116
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,120
from the old heroes of the east.

117
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,120
The power is even more powerful.

118
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,120
I admire the magic of the east

119
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,120
and the secret magic of the city.

120
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,120
But what I admire more

121
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:00,120
is the chest of the old heroes of the east.

122
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,120
They gave the secret magic of the fire

123
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,120
to Mr. Jin,

124
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,120
who is not a son or a son-in-law.

125
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,120
They are not worried that Mr. Jin will get the real power

126
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,120
and will deal with his daughter in the future.

127
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,120
They are in the Villa of Fire alone.

128
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,120
This is the inside of the Villa of Fire.

129
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,120
You don't need to know.

130
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,120
Of course.

131
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,120
I trust Mr. Jin like the old heroes of the east.

132
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,120
But the people in the world

133
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,120
only look at the result.

134
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,120
What if the world thinks that

135
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,120
Mr. Jin is a despicable villain

136
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,120
who has done everything to take the throne?

137
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,120
I'm afraid after today's battle,

138
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,120
Mr. Jin will not be able to

139
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,120
get the throne for free.

140
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,120
After all, Yang Ming can be the exception.

141
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,120
Stop talking nonsense.

142
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,120
What do you want?

143
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,120
Don't worry.

144
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,120
We are here to help Mr. Jin.

145
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,120
As long as Mr. Jin agrees,

146
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,120
Mr. Jin will marry Wang Quan

147
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,120
for the marriage of his cousin.

148
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,120
Since they are a family,

149
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,120
the two old heroes of the east will be killed.

150
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,120
The missing of the two daughters.

151
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,120
Whatever Mr. Jin says,

152
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,120
Wang Quan Villa will not object.

153
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,120
At that time,

154
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,120
who else in the world will not believe it?

155
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,120
Who dares not believe it?

156
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,120
I'm sorry.

157
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,120
My lord.

158
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,120
I have done what I promised to you.

159
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,120
So what you promised is...

160
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,120
I will marry Wang Quan.

161
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,120
I will marry Wang Quan.

162
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,120
I will marry Wang Quan.

163
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,120
I will marry Wang Quan.

164
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,120
I will marry Wang Quan.

165
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,120
I will marry Wang Quan.

166
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,120
I will marry Wang Quan.

167
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,120
I will marry Wang Quan.

168
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,120
I will marry Wang Quan.

169
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,120
I will marry Wang Quan.

170
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,120
I will marry Wang Quan.

171
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,120
I will marry Wang Quan.

172
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,120
I will marry Wang Quan.

173
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,120
I will marry Wang Quan.

174
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,120
I will marry Wang Quan.

175
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,120
I will marry Wang Quan.

176
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,120
I will marry Wang Quan.

177
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,120
I will marry Wang Quan.

178
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,120
I will marry Wang Quan.

179
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,120
I will marry Wang Quan.

180
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,120
I will marry Wang Quan.

181
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,120
I will marry Wang Quan.

182
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,120
I will marry Wang Quan.

183
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,120
I will marry Wang Quan.

184
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,120
I will marry Wang Quan.

185
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,120
I will marry Wang Quan.

186
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,120
I will marry Wang Quan.

187
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,120
I will marry Wang Quan.

188
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,620
I shall marry Wang Quan.

189
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,620
I shall marry Wang Quan.

190
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:20,120
Please.

191
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,120
Elves of the Deceased.

192
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,120
Greetings to Chief.

193
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,620
Greetings to Yellow Lake Chief.

194
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,620
That day,

195
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,020
the strongest swordsman I've ever met

196
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,140
from a heart that can memorize the best sword in the world

197
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,300
but already has no forward Court of�

198
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:07,780
certain.

199
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:41,740
So I am thevethe daughter cron gets the care of one's brother

00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,840
you will say I am your brother

202
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,020
I am sorry

203
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,720
Wang Feiyi

204
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,620
I know you are over alcohol

205
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,020
You can't beitus

206
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,220
We should be extends

207
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:01,960
No

208
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,680
There is no need

209
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,380
We just have bi birth

210
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,020
Mr. Fei,

211
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,660
don't say anything.

212
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,020
I know

213
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,580
that my love

214
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,460
is the only way

215
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,060
to solve the problem.

216
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,700
Moreover,

217
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,620
what she said is true.

218
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,980
There is no one

219
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,740
who can kill her.

220
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,180
Mr. Three.

221
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,220
Basically,

222
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,460
if Mr. Shao

223
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,540
were still the one,

224
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,620
الش Pay No attention

225
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,100
Shade with heart

226
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,420
The clean road

227
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:49,260
Forgot about the return

228
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,220
I am Michio

229
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:59,040
Jiu

230
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,140
Wang Quan Is the heir

231
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:03,620
Mortハハ

232
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:06,620
This is a famous thing in the martial arts world.

233
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,620
As for her marriage proposal,

234
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:11,620
when she was still a concubine,

235
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:15,620
most of the time, she was just a pre-eminent official.

236
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,620
I successfully became Jing Ranfeng's

237
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,620
cousin who was in the Wangquan family.

238
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,620
Lover

239
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,620
Eat well

240
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,360
Never stare

241
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:17,360
I let alone

242
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,780
You

243
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,700
love me as well as me

244
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,620
And I am both heartbroken

245
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,620
You are so gentle

246
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,620
I saw it from the beginning

247
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,620
I don't know what else I can do

248
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,620
when we are like this

249
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,620
I saw it from the beginning

250
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,620
But I only remember

251
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,620
I want to be by your side

252
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,620
I want to be by your side

253
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,620
If you are in a dream

254
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,620
Even if you forget everything

255
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,620
Even if you forget everything

256
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,620
Time will pass

257
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,620
I want to be by your side

258
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,620
I want to be by your side

259
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,620
But I don't know what else I can do

260
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,740
Remember

261
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,900
All the times when we used to rural villages

262
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,420
Ji Nianfei has some detailed information,

263
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:41,980
but there is no such thing with the

264
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,460
lightness of this vegetable.

265
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,580
So, let's go to have a Papaya Doll with us.

266
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:59,380
So good.

267
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,300
As for it,

268
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,300
you've done everything.

269
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:22,780
Awu.

270
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:29,940
Madam.

271
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:32,820
Where's Master?

272
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,980
Master went to the back hill to practice swordsmanship.

273
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,500
Madam.

274
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,380
Madam, you've been looking for me.

275
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,260
What's the matter?

276
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,700
I have two things

277
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,180
to ask you for help.

278
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,620
The first thing I want to do

279
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,140
is to find Miss Qin Lan.

280
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:12,900
Madam, don't worry.

281
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,980
Master has sent people

282
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,580
to search for Miss Qin Lan.

283
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,380
There's no news yet.

284
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:24,380
But I found a very secret place

285
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,300
and arranged a

286
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:29,300
niece who is the same age as Miss Qin Lan to live in.

287
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,140
She lives in a small house every day.

288
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,780
There's a fengshui thunderbolt outside the door.

289
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,380
Four elite disciples

290
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,300
guard it secretly.

291
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:41,020
I believe anyone who finds it

292
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,460
will think that

293
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,780
Miss Qin Lan is protected inside.

294
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,380
No one will

295
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,740
look for Miss Qin Lan anymore.

296
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:49,740
Thank you.

297
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,460
There's one more thing

298
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,140
to bother you.

299
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,900
You don't have to be so polite.

300
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,340
Just tell me.

301
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,300
My father

302
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,620
was killed by the Jinyan Wind.

303
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,980
I want to find out

304
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,540
where the water demon is from.

305
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,300
The Jinyan Wind

306
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,820
It's already too late.

307
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,460
Master,

308
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,540
you should go back to rest.

309
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,580
It's a golden night.

310
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,660
You and your wife should take good care of yourselves.

311
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,140
Have you found

312
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:58,940
where Qin Lan is?

313
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,500
Not yet.

314
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,180
But don't worry, Master.

315
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,460
Her life is more important than the world.

316
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:05,940
I know

317
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,420
I won't let you down.

318
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:12,140
I've sent all the information

319
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,620
about the water demon to you.

320
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,100
Master,

321
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,740
won't you help me?

322
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,060
Send someone to keep an eye on the Jinyan Wind.

323
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,340
If there's any news,

324
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,180
just tell me.

325
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,740
I understand.

326
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,460
It's already too late.

327
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,820
You and the bird's nest

328
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,740
should go back to rest.

329
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,700
Send her back.

330
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,020
Master.

331
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:43,860
Go.

332
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,340
The Jinyan Wind

333
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:05,860
This is the bird's nest

334
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,780
that Master sent by the director of the Ming Fei.

335
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,540
He also told me

336
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,620
that you need to take care of yourself.

337
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,060
It's so late.

338
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,380
She hasn't gone to rest yet.

339
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,140
Master,

340
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:20,140
you should practice sword practice late every day.

341
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,340
I know.

342
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,180
Master,

343
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,340
you're awake.

344
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,580
I'm fine.

345
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,340
I'm fine.

346
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,180
I'm fine.

347
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,060
I'm fine.

348
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:33,940
I'm fine.

349
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:34,940
I'm fine.

350
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:35,940
I'm fine.

351
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:36,940
I'm fine.

352
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:37,940
I'm fine.

353
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:38,940
I'm fine.

354
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:39,940
I'm fine.

355
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:40,940
I'm fine.

356
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:41,940
I'm fine.

357
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:42,940
I'm fine.

358
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:43,940
I'm fine.

359
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:44,940
I'm fine.

360
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:45,940
I'm fine.

361
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:46,940
I'm fine.

362
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:47,940
I'm fine.

363
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:48,940
I'm fine.

364
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:49,940
I'm fine.

365
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:50,940
I'm fine.

366
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,100
I'm fine.

367
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,140
I'm fine.

368
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,140
I'm fine.

369
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,140
I'm fine.

370
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,340
I'm fine.

371
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,340
I'm fine.

372
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,340
I'm fine.

373
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,340
I'm fine.

374
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,340
I'm fine.

375
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,340

I'm fine.

383
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,340
I'm fine.

384
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,340
I'm fine.

385
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,340
I'm fine.

386
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,340
I'm fine.

387
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,340
I'm fine.

388
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,340
I'm fine.

389
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,340
I'm fine.

390
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,340
I'm fine.

391
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,340
I'm fine.

392
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,340
I'm fine.

393
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,340
I'm fine.

394
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,340
I'm fine.

395
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,340
I'm fine.

396
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,340
I'm fine.

397
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,340
I'm fine.

398
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,340
I'm fine.

399
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,340
I'm fine.

400
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,340
I became your wife.

401
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:31,340
I'm destined to be a courtesan.

402
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,340
You're here,

403
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,340
but I'm not.

404
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,340
And my heart

405
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,340
is not here.

406
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,340
I'm fine.

407
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,340
I'm fine.

408
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,340
I'm fine.

409
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,340
I'm fine.

410
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,340
I'm fine.

411
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,340
I'm fine.

412
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,340
I'm fine.

413
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,340
I'm fine.

414
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,340
I'm fine.

415
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,340
I'm fine.

416
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,340
I'm fine.

417
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,340
I'm fine.

418
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,340
I'm fine.

419
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,340
I'm fine.

420
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,340
I'm fine.

421
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,340
I'm fine.

422
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,340
I'm fine.

423
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,340
I'm fine.

424
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,340
I'm fine.

425
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,340
I'm fine.

426
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,340
I'm fine.

427
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,340
I'm fine.

428
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,340
I'm fine.

429
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,340
I'm fine.

430
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,460
Rose.

431
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,460
Please...

432
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,620
Brother.

433
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,500
The 프로 서�마น

434
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,260
is to protect our Brother's

435
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,820
2,000 years old.

436
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,420
The Master of Thunder nuke

437
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,380
is here,

438
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,060
at Green Mosque

439
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,020
behind the Taoism V跳 б

440
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:19,780
to show you

441
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,740
that...

442
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:24,140
I will never give you a chance to hurt me.

443
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:51,620
Dad.

444
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,420
I can finally avenge you.

445
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,580
Zhao Si.

446
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,440
Rah!"

447
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:51,480
Push!

448
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:12,560
I don't need to refresh the wound.

449
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:14,640
A little wound

450
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,200
can give her everything she's got.

451
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:20,200
I'd rather die than live.

452
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:50,600
Unfettered Love

453
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,040
Don't you

454
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,980
usually do nothing?

455
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,720
Why did you come here secretly?

456
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,740
I'm not afraid of disaster.

457
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,960
But the fees you suffered

458
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,280
on behalf of me

459
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:29,400
might make you ashamed.

460
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,420
Shen Xie

461
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,800
My Shen Xie

462
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,800
I...

463
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,800
The God's blood...

464
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,800
My God's blood...

465
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,800
Did I lose my God's blood?

466
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,800
Is there no way to make up for it?

467
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,800
Master, what's wrong with you?

468
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,800
I got a little fever.

469
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,800
What's wrong?

470
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,800
Master, I recently found some scouts from Wangquan Villa.

471
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,800
They...

472
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,800
Enough.

473
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,800
Don't bother me with this stupid thing in the future.

474
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,800
But, Master...

475
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,800
Shut up!

476
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,800
I want the elixir you're making.

477
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,800
Have you made it?

478
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,800
Master, all I need is some salt and lean elixir.

479
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,800
It's very precious.

480
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,800
And the amount you want is not small.

481
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:58,800
At present, the amount of herbs that Shanzhuang can make is far from enough.

482
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,800
So we...

483
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,800
If it's not enough, then buy it.

484
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,800
Master,

485
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,800
do I have to teach you such a little thing?

486
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,800
Yes.

487
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,800
Master, you are...

488
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,800
I'm not feeling well.

489
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,800
I need to practice.

490
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,800
Bring me all the elixir I need.

491
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,800
Do you hear me?

492
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,800
Yes.

493
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,800
Go.

494
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,800
Kill everyone in the mansion!

495
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,800
Kill!

496
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,800
Because the young elite of Yiqi Sect are so weak,

497
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,800
they took the opportunity to take advantage of the situation.

498
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,800
Hurry up!

499
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,800
The village is under attack by the evil demon!

500
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,800
Everyone, follow me!

501
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,800
Hurry!

502
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,800
The players who are facing the danger

503
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,800
fly to the mansion like snowflakes.

504
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,800
Everyone is waiting to see

505
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,800
how the current Kunju will react

506
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,800
if they lose the new owner of the mansion.

507
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,800
Kill!

508
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,800
Yes!

509
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,800
Kill!

510
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,800
Stop!

511
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,800
Stop!

512
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,800
Don't run!

513
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,800
The evil demon

514
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,800
can't live in peace?

515
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,800
If you are strong,

516
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,800
you will be punished.

517
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,800
If you want to blame someone,

518
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,800
blame the Yiqi Sect

519
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,800
for being weak.

520
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,800
You are all wrong.

521
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,800
You are all wrong.

522
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,800
You are all wrong.

523
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,800
You are all wrong.

524
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,800
You are all wrong.

525
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,800
You are all wrong.

526
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,800
You are all wrong.

527
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,800
You are all wrong.

528
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,800
Stop being weak.

529
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,800
I was wrong.

530
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,800
I should have done everything

531
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,800
to stop the Dark Lake from falling.

532
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,800
Did I make a mistake?

533
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,800
The whole Yixing clan is getting more and more powerful

534
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,800
against Wang Quan's mountain villa.

535
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,600
The elder of Wang Quan's family

536
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,600
is also becoming more and more dissatisfied

537
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,800
with Hongye.

538
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,800
The demon that can't kill

539
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,800
is like the poisonous wood that is laughing at Hongye.

540
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,800
It has also caused suspicion in his heart.

541
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,800
He is quiet.

542
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,800
Can't you change the dilemma

543
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,800
between the human and the demon?

544
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,800
I swear that

545
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,800
my decision

546
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,800
is not suitable.

547
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,800
Young people are always

548
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,800
afraid of the world.

549
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,800
As time goes by,

550
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,800
people will eventually

551
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,800
see the end.

552
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,800
I'll go.

553
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,800
Hongye and I have done everything

554
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,800
but only prevented the Black Tiger from being cut.

555
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,800
If hatred is not eliminated,

556
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,800
the eternal night will not really disappear.

557
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,800
Maybe

558
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,800
this is the only way

559
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,800
to solve this.

560
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,800
I'll go.

561
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,800
I'll go.

562
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,800
I'll go.

563
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,800
I'll go.

564
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,800
I'll go.

565
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,800
I'll go.

566
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,800
I'll go.

567
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,800
I'll go.

568
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,800
I'll go.

569
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,800
I'll go.

570
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,800
I'll go.

571
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,800
I'll go.

572
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,800
I'll go.

573
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,800
I'll go.

574
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,800
I'll go.
