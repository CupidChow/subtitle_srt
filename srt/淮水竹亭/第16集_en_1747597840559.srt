1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The truth is...

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The truth is...

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The truth is...

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The truth is...

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The truth is...

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The truth is...

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The truth is...

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The truth is...

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The truth is...

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The truth is...

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The truth is...

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The truth is...

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The truth is...

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The truth is...

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The truth is...

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The truth is...

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Episode 2

18
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
They're right.

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You've known them for only a few days.

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Why are you taking risks with them?

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,220
Listen to them.

22
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,220
Go to the mountain to play.

23
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,040
Speaking of which,

24
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,040
I have to thank you.

25
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,460
Thank you for treating my cousin and Wang Quan.

26
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,160
Thank you, Miss Cuiyu.

27
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,160
Thank me?

28
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,960
Then...

29
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,280
Why don't you just marry me?

30
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,900
Miss Cuiyu?

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Miss Cuiyu...

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
This is a bit too much.

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Little Mian Kuan,

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
do you think you like me a little bit?

35
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Miss Cuiyu?

36
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,660
You know me?

37
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I like you.

38
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,740
Heart is beating fast...

39
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,740
Really?

40
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,740
You have finally found it?

41
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,660
Very good.

42
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,220
Next question,

43
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,220
Which one do you like?

44
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:56,020
The red-eyed Cui Yu Ming Lan or the blue-eyed Cui Yu Ming Lan?

45
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,220
Isn't it all you?

46
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,520
Of course not.

47
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,420
He is him, I am me.

48
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,420
You must think it through before you answer.

49
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,720
You must not make a mistake.

50
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,220
How can I answer that?

51
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,220
What do you think?

52
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,720
You already have an answer in your mind. How can I answer that?

53
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,820
It's wrong for you to believe me.

54
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,320
How did I fool you?

55
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,220
When the red-eyed Cui Yu Ming Lan comes out, his behavior is always too aggressive.

56
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,820
Now, he is the one who should be the blue-eyed Cui Yu Ming Lan.

57
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,320
You are wrong.

58
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,820
As expected, you still like the blue-eyed Cui Yu Ming Lan's gentleness.

59
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,220
Girls might not be gentle,

60
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,820
but they must be kind

61
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,320
at least kind.

62
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,320
I am not a human, I am a demon.

63
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,820
Demons are demons too.

64
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,320
Okay, I know your answer.

65
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,320
Okay.

66
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,320
Take care, Cui Yu.

67
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:25,320
I wonder when we will meet again.

68
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,320
I know you don't want me to go to the adventure,

69
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,320
but I'm still worried about you.

70
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,320
Why don't you let me out?

71
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,320
Why don't you let me see Mr. Mu?

72
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,320
Shut up.

73
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,320
You're getting more and more extreme.

74
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,320
You have to be careful not to be affected by Jin Chen Xi.

75
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,320
Shut up.

76
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:11,320
Mr. Mu's personality will never leave his cousin alone.

77
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:15,320
He's angry with you on purpose because he's afraid you're in danger.

78
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,320
You're not afraid of him?

79
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,320
I'm afraid of him.

80
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,320
I'm afraid of him.

81
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,320
I'm afraid of him.

82
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,320
He's afraid you're in danger.

83
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,320
You know that again.

84
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,320
He likes you because you're gentle and kind.

85
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,320
He likes you because you're gentle and kind.

86
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,320
We can talk about it later.

87
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,320
The most important thing now is Mr. Mu.

88
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,320
Mr. Mu.

89
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,320
What do you want?

90
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,320
You like Little Noodle, too, right?

91
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,320
You heard what I asked him today.

92
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,320
He likes us.

93
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:09,320
To be precise, he likes you.

94
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,320
He hates me like you.

95
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,320
He hates me because I'm a scary monster.

96
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,320
We don't hate you.

97
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,320
We?

98
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,320
What do you mean, we?

99
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,320
Are you guys a couple?

100
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,320
What?

101
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,320
He'll protect you from now on.

102
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,320
You don't need me anymore?

103
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,320
You're right.

104
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,320
So it's your turn to repay me.

105
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,320
What are you doing?

106
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,320
I want you to sleep forever.

107
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,320
Don't wake up again.

108
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,320
You're so weak.

109
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,320
You're so weak.

110
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,320
How can you get his love?

111
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,320
How can you not take our body?

112
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,320
How can you?

113
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:34,320
My techniques from 20 years ago were really noble.

114
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:40,320
But give me some time to improve.

115
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:46,320
ott

116
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,320
But the Mystic BlockRAD bean was under my control.

117
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,320
I was too useless.

118
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,320
I'll officially wake him up.

119
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,680
I will wake him up

120
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,320
and stop him from being swallowed by the demon's breath

121
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,920
and turn him into the Black Tiger's container.

122
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,160
According to what you said,

123
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,520
the golden dust is used to make the demon's life.

124
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,000
There must be the Zhao Lingluo Powder on the upper part of the hair.

125
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,400
Zhao Lingluo Powder?

126
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,960
This powder can purify the resentment.

127
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,440
It may also purify the demon's breath in the host's body.

128
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,960
But I have to solve the problem first.

129
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,960
He is the root cause of all the trouble.

130
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,600
Don't worry.

131
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,720
I have sent people to get the dragon blood you want.

132
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,080
It's on the way.

133
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,160
Jiuhuo is injured.

134
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,960
Tomorrow night is her weakness.

135
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,640
We should take action at that time.

136
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,320
Tomorrow's battle is the last battle.

137
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:57,320
Huaiju, I will take you back.

138
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,320
Wangquan Hongye, are you ready?

139
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,320
Yes.

140
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,320
Lord Jiuhuo,

141
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,320
all the elders of the Imperial Fist Clan are here.

142
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,320
Greetings, Lord Jiuhuo.

143
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,320
You are all my clan.

144
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,320
I don't want to kill you.

145
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,320
It's our honor to die for you.

146
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,320
It's our honor to die for you.

147
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,320
There is no cure for the water.

148
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,320
Only this way can fix the last flaw of Jin Chenxi.

149
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,320
Jialan, we will meet again.

150
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,320
Jialan, we will meet again.

151
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,320
Jiuhuo, you are so powerful that you dare to fight against the gods.

152
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:25,320
Why are you hiding from me?

153
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:30,320
Wangquan Hongye, are you here to die?

154
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,320
You don't even know the night abyss.

155
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,320
I am here to die.

156
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,320
I am here to die.

157
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,320
I am here to die.

158
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,320
I am here to die.

159
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,320
I am here to die.

160
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,320
I am here to die.

161
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,320
Are you here to die?

162
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,320
You don't even know the night abyss.

163
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,320
You even took the elixir.

164
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,320
When did you decide to judge me?

165
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,320
You are so pitiful.

166
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,320
18 years ago, you fought against the black fox.

167
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,320
The mask group was almost completely destroyed.

168
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:15,320
All of this is because of your selfishness.

169
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,320
Are you not pitiful?

170
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,320
I will not give you another chance.

171
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,320
I will not give you another chance.

172
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,320
Brother!

173
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,320
Brother!

174
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,320
Brother, you are still so slow.

175
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:46,320
You can fight against me with these old and weak?

176
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,320
Boss, unseal the sword!

177
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,320
I will kill you first.

178
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,320
I will kill you first.

179
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,320
There is a difference between us.

180
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,320
What's the use of opening the night abyss?

181
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,320
Group Battle

182
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,320
para

183
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,720
вып Physics

184
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,720
Bloody

185
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,320
No!

186
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,320
You guys are so weak.

187
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,480
If you didn't save that old bastard,

188
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,800
you could've at least survived.

189
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,520
Great.

190
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,960
Tiens are dead now..

191
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,960
I'll see what you're going to do.

192
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,960
You...

193
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,960
Miss Cuiyu.

194
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,960
A water demon.

195
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,960
How dare you fight against me for them?

196
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,960
As long as I can protect her, what's wrong with fighting against the enemy?

197
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,960
How dare you fight against me with the power of the morning dew?

198
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,960
Miss Cuiyu.

199
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,960
Little devil.

200
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,960
You're already hurt.

201
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,960
If you use that trick again, you'll die.

202
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,960
Hurry up.

203
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,960
Miss Cuiyu.

204
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,960
Big brother!

205
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,960
Go!

206
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,960
Dragon blood?

207
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,960
Young master Wang Quan!

208
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,960
The same weapon.

209
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,960
Fire!

210
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,960
Miss Cuiyu.

211
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,960
Go!

212
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,960
Miss Cuiyu.

213
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,960
Tell me.

214
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,960
What's holding you back?

215
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:38,960
The dragon bone, dragon blood, Wang Quan clan's personality is the dragon clan.

216
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,960
So that's what it is.

217
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,960
You think you can get away with this?

218
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,960
I'm not going to let you go.

219
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,960
I'm going to kill you.

220
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,960
I'm going to kill you.

221
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,960
I'm going to kill you.

222
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,960
I'm going to kill you.

223
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,960
You think you can win?

224
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,960
I'm going to kill you.

225
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,960
You think you can win?

226
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,800
I Nandu.

227
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:52,920
Who am I?

228
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,080
I wasjedou Mendoza.

229
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,720
Ah Yuan Jin huyushu.

230
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,380
analyses pubeat.

231
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:09,080
Nanduhoa integrate Energy flow.

232
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,580
A counterpart.

233
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,960
It makes him larger,

234
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:15,800
or

235
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,240
Ren.

236
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,360
How hilarious.

237
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,800
This is so hilarious.

238
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,380
Wei Zhu.

239
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,560
Who are you, Prince of the Nossa.

240
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,500
Love?

241
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,360
As we say

242
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:57,100
love

243
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,180
is the weakness of all of you.

244
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,960
Brother!

245
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,960
Brother!

246
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,960
Princess Wang Xuan!

247
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:25,960
Now, you still believe that Dongfang Huai Zhu is still here?

248
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:30,960
What exactly do you want to do?

249
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,960
What do I want to do?

250
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,960
I want to kill Dongfang Huai Zhu.

251
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,960
I want to kill Dongfang Huai Zhu.

252
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,960
I want to kill Dongfang Huai Zhu.

253
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,960
I want to kill Dongfang Huai Zhu.

254
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,960
What do I want to do?

255
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:51,960
I am a bad person who has been in the mountain and in the tree.

256
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,960
I am a bad person who has been in the mountain and in the tree.

257
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,960
Tell me, what do I want to do?

258
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,960
Why can't there be good in this world?

259
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,960
Why can't there be evil in this world?

260
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,960
Why can't there be good in this world?

261
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,960
Why can't there be evil in this world?

262
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,960
Why can't there be love?

263
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,960
This is the reason why Jialan failed.

264
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:35,960
Fortunately, I am not him.

265
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,960
You...

266
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,960
You have been...

267
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,960
You have been lying to me.

268
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,960
If you don't believe that Dongfang Huai Zhu is still here,

269
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:52,960
why would you risk your life to help me get rid of Jiuhua?

270
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,960
Does it hurt?

271
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,960
It hurts, right?

272
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,960
Your hatred is my best friend.

273
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:36,960
All the demons in the world are my enemies.

274
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,960
All the demons in the world are my enemies.

275
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,960
My servants,

276
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,960
My servants,

277
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,960
give yourself to me.

278
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,960
Give yourself to me.

279
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:24,960
I am not Jialan, nor Dongfang Huai Zhu.

280
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,960
I am...

281
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,960
I am...

282
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,960
I am...

283
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,960
I am...

284
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,960
I am...

285
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,960
I am...

286
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,960
I am...

287
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,960
I am...

288
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:58,960
I am the only Man Tuo Hua on the black bitter tree.

289
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,960
What is this?

290
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,960
What is this?

291
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,960
What is this?

292
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,960
Run!

293
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,960
Run!

294
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,960
What do you want?

295
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,960
If we can't live together, then let's die together.

296
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,960
I understand.

297
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,960
Dongfang Huai Zhu is still here.

298
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,960
I will give you a life.

299
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,960
I will give you a life.

300
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,960
I will give you a life.

301
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,380
will never treat you well after all.

302
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:02,220
However, with Bandit's power that can control the temperature,

303
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:06,340
I was not one to act like this.

304
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:11,720
When Hao Yan's clearly possessed with hopes,

305
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,340
he could be out of control.

306
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,460
But he must have taken charge of my mother,

307
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,460
and has no right to itself.

308
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,320
He's trying to get out of my way.

309
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,320
Sangguk.

310
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,220
Sangguk...

311
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,520
Why did you go back with another person?

312
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,820
An'er,

313
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,120
Something terrible has happened before!

314
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:44,520
I told you to promise me that you will punish him personally.

315
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,320
So now,

316
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,220
you can voice your最近 sorry to the others.

317
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,720
Please!

318
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,720
Come back, Dongfang.

319
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:15,720
Come back, Dongfang.

320
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,720
Dongfang.

321
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,720
Dongfang.

322
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,720
Dongfang.

323
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:55,720
Dongfang.

324
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,720
Dongfang.

325
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:25,720
Dongfang.

326
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:55,720
Dongfang.

327
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:25,720
Dongfang.
