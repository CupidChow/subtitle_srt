Jiuhuo.

128
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,780
You must bow to your master.

00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,780
Brother, you're awake.

130
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,620

135
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,300
I sent for a mission

136
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,700
I need to take medicine

137
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:04,080
Is Lord Wenxin here?

Where's Mu Mian?

153
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,320
He's injured.

154
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,800
His spirit energy has been exhausted.

155
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,640
But he should be fine.

156
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,360
Miss Cuiyu is taking care of him.

157
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,400

158
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,760
we can go back.

159
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,640
But how are you going to deal with the wine and goods?

160
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,960
The wine and goods are immortal.

161
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,360
It was sealed before.

162
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,240
We brought it back to 20 years ago.

163
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,520
We sealed it again.

164
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:57,840

I'll appear before Brother Ling in 10 years.

169
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,360
Yuxuan,

00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,760

172
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,440
Okay, I'm laughing very hard.

173
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,160
Do you think you can get away with this?

174
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,000
Let's go.

175
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,280
Give me your hand.

176
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,880
Your hand is a little cold.

177
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,920
Warm it up for me.

178
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,400
It's warm.

179
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,680
Is it warmer?

180
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,480
You've been in many battles.

181
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,080
Your internal organs are seriously damaged.

182
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,040
You need to take care of it after you go back.

183
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,520
Huai Zhu,

184
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,240
I want to understand two things about this battle.

185
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,520
The first thing is that I want to apologize to you.

186
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,520
I didn't tell you the truth.

187
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,080
I didn't mean to hide my dual identity from you.

188
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,400
I just want to tell you when the time is right.

189
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,520
And the second thing is that

190
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,400
I don't want to make the appointment for the seventh month of the first month.

191
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,400
In the Yang family,

192
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,240
we've said that we'll never meet again.

193
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,240
Young Master Wang Quan,

194
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,840
please stay.

195
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,960
The seventh month of the first month,

196
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,960
the water will be the roof,

197
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,320
let's be friends.

198
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,600
So,

199
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,480
you want to see me

200
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,520
only at the seventh month of the first month of each year?

201
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,720
Of course not.

202
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,880
Don't tell me

203
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,160
you're SUBSCRIBE toJessica's big video.

204
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,700
Are you tricking me?

205
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,640
Have this medicine.

206
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,480
I'm sorry.

207
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,800
But

208
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,840
there's still some inner energy

209
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,680
and soul fragments in my body.

210
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,440
The Black Fox is so cruel.

211
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,680
If we really break it,

212
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,760
the consequences will be unimaginable.

213
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,920
We can't sleep anyway.

214
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,200
Let's go out and take a walk.

215
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,240
Let's go and see

216
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,240
the world twenty years later.

217
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,880
I never thought this street was so far away

218
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,480
because of people and demons

219
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,720
praying together.

220
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,160
Whether it's people or demons,

221
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,360
everyone wants the same thing.

222
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,720
Bless my father.

223
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,440
May he be healthy.

224
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,080
Brother Neg meus altando estava dulcemente.

225
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,600
Mother too.

226
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,580
They are all in despair

227
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,040
trying to find hope

228
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,920
to choose this life

229
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,280
as a いordinary thing.

230
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,600
People

231
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:33,920
and the demons

232
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,760
are all living against their own will,

233
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,120
whether they receive anything in return.

234
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,600
The Make a Wish

235
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,960
There's no sleeping pill.

236
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,240
He talks so loudly about快乐的事.

237
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,720
Finally you slept soundly.

238
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,360
After you conjunto to fix the magic device,

239
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,760
we can go back.

240
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,440
I...

241
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,200
I'm afraid.

242
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Hongye.

243
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,400
I have a question for you.

244
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,400
In order to save me,

245
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,400
why did you do this?

246
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,800
I've never thought about it.

247
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,200
What if the result is not as you wish?

248
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,400
I've never thought about it.

249
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,800
Then what have you thought about?

250
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,800
I can't lose you.

251
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,200
You're not the only one.

252
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,760
I'm not afraid of the cold.

00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,760

How sad

297
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,760
I'm not willing to be with you for the rest of my life

298
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:21,540

Dare to go

305
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,260
Are you okay?

306
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,260
I'm fine.

307
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,260
Isn't this how we usually drink?

308
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,260
Really?

309
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:02,260
Then why do I feel that today is very different?

310
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,260
Let me count.

311
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,260
The first time was when we were in the mud.

312
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,260
The second time was when we were in the sky.

313
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,260
There were so many times when we were in the sky.

314
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,260
And then we had a mission.

315
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,260
Xiao Mei.

316
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,260
Another mission?

317
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,260
Xiao Mei.

318
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:25,260
Yitan, do you remember when we were young,

319
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,260
my father would hold you like that.

320
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,260
He would walk up to me and say,

321
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,260
you are my future husband.

322
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,260
Of course I remember.

323
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:36,260
But that day, you stole the rice wine from home.

324
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,260
You immediately started drinking.

325
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:41,260
You chased me and scolded me and bit me.

326
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,260
You still wouldn't marry me.

327
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,260
It was all when we were young.

328
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:51,260
Yitan, you were so young.

329
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,260
You were so young.

330
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,260
You were so young.

331
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,260
You were so young.

332
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,260
You were so young.

333
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:03,260
Yitan was always very nice to me.

334
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:06,260
He always made me feel at ease.

335
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:12,260
He even made me feel a sense of foreboding.

336
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,260
What sense of foreboding?

337
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,260
Do you like me?

338
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,260
Of course I like you.

339
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,260
Because you are my sister.

340
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,260
Xiao Mei.

341
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,260

342
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,260

343
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,260
Xiao Mei.

344
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,260
Xiao Mei.

345
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,260
Xiao Mei.

346
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,260
Xiao Mei.

347
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,260
Xiao Mei.

348
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,260
Xiao Mei.

349
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,260
Xiao Mei.

350
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,260
Xiao Mei.

351
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,260
Xiao Mei.

352
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,260
Xiao Mei.

353
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,260
Xiao Mei.

354
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,260
Xiao Mei.

355
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,260
Xiao Mei.

356
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,260
Xiao Mei.

357
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,260
Xiao Mei.

358
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,260
Xiao Mei.

359
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,260
Xiao Mei.

360
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,260
Xiao Mei.

361
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,260
Xiao Mei.

362
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,260
Xiao Mei.

363
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,260
Xiao Mei.

364
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,260
Xiao Mei.

365
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,260
Xiao Mei.

366
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,260
Xiao Mei.

367
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,260
Xiao Mei.

368
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,260
Fourth Brother.

369
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,260
What is it?

370
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,260
Nothing.

371
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:41,260
It's just that I haven't seen you in a long time.

372
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,260
I want to see you more.

373
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,260
You can't hide your feelings.

374
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,260
Just tell me what you want to say.

375
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,260
I think...

376
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,260
There are some things...

377
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,260
You have the right to know.

378
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:25,260
These are all after my brother died.

379
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:29,260
These are all letters from Miss Huizhuai to you after my brother died.

380
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,260
Huizhuai?

381
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:36,260
It's Dongfeng Huizhuo that you kept in the spring after you were out of power.

382
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,260
Every year on your death day,

383
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:44,260
he would bring the letter to your coffin.

384
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:49,260
I decided to keep these letters.

385
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,260
There are not many letters.

386
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,260
Because...

387
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,260
Ten years after you were out of power,

388
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,260
he died.

389
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,260
Brother.

390
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,260
Don't you want to see it?

391
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,260
Brother,

392
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,260
don't you want to see it?

393
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,260
I don't want to see it.

394
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,260
I believe that

395
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,260
fate can be changed,

396
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,260
and the future can be seen.

397
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:14,260
This is definitely not the end of Dongfeng and I.

398
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,260
You are here to laugh at me.

399
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,260
You lost.

400
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,260
You clearly know that

401
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:38,260
as long as there is evil in the world,

402
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:41,260
the black-bone love tree will be destroyed.

403
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,260
You are not a man.

404
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,260
You are a man.

405
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,260
You are a man.

406
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,260
You are a man.

407
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,260
You are a man.

408
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,260
You are a man.

409
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:56,260
The black-bone love tree will always be there.

410
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:01,260
My Jialan will definitely come back.

411
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,260
Of course I know that

412
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,260
the evil thoughts in the world will never be eliminated.

413
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,260
No matter how hard we try.

414
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,260
You are afraid.

415
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,260
Likewise,

416
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,260
you can't stop the light.

417
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,260
The light of the black-bone love tree

418
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,260
is like this moment.

419
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,260
The arrows in our hands

420
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,260
will pierce your chest deeply

421
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,260
and make you afraid.

422
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,260
Even if we fall,

423
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,260
the future people will know

424
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,260
that you are not weak.

425
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,260
I believe that

426
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,260
as long as there are people holding swords,

427
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,260
there will be a day when the world will be clear.

428
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,260
No.

429
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,260
I will kill all the people holding swords first.

430
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,260
I

431
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,260
will definitely kill you.

432
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,260
Come on, Brother 4th.

433
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,260
It's really been a long time

434
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,260
since we had such a fast drinking.

435
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,260
Are you happy?

436
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:19,260
I should say this.

437
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,260
The wine I drink alone

438
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,260
in the Poting Temple

439
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,260
is bitter.

440
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,260
To the meeting.

441
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,260
To the farewell.

442
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,260
To reunion, to farewell.

443
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,260
Let's drink.

444
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,260
Cheers.

445
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,260
Cheers.

446
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,260
Actually, thinking about it,

447
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,260
this wine store is a bit sentimental.

448
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,260
It's not worth sympathizing

449
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,260
for the personal feelings of the two of you.

450
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,260
Please.

451
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,260
You humans are really funny.

452
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,260
I think he is not wrong at all.

453
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,260
As long as the people I like can be free and comfortable,

454
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,260
I don't care about the others.

455
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,260
Love is hard to mention.

456
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,260
Let's just pass this topic.

457
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,260
Yes.

458
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,260
No matter what,

459
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,260
he lost.

460
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,260
My brother is right.

461
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,260
Let's drink to the end.

462
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,260
Cheers.

463
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,260
Cheers.

464
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,260
Cheers.

465
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,260
Cheers.

466
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,260
Your mother loves this fish the most.

467
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,260
Try it.

468
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,260
My mother often mentioned you to me.

469
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,260
She was obsessed with it.

470
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,260
You look like your mother.

471
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,260
Really?

472
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,260
Come on.

473
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,260
Mu Min.

474
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,260
You haven't recovered yet.

475
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,260
I'll drink this for her.

476
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,260
I'll drink it for her.

477
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,260
I'll drink the next cup for Mu Min.

478
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,260
Actually,

479
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:03,260
the small chain will be repaired soon.

480
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,260
Once the small chain is opened,

481
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:13,260
you can all go back.

482
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,260
I'll be here alone.

483
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,260
Brother.

484
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,260
Didn't we agree that

485
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:28,260
we would change everything?

486
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,260
We would all be alive.

487
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,260
The Pottian Temple

488
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,260
won't be so cold and quiet.

489
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,260
It won't be so dark and gloomy.

490
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:37,260
The mountains will be covered with water and the land will be barren.

491
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:42,260
The whole foot step will be covered with water and the land will be barren.

492
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,260
Great.

493
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,260
Our Brother Tao Jisi is back.

494
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,260
Come on.

495
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,260
The mask troupe that was established 20 years ago,

496
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,260
and us after 20 years,

497
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,260
all the unhappiness and pain

498
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,260
will all pass.

499
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,260
Cheers.

500
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,260
Cheers.

501
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,260
Cheers.

502
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,260
Cheers.

503
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,260
Mu Min.

504
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,260
Miss Huai Zhu, how is my brother?

505
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,260
His body is broken in five ways.

506
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,260
His meridians are broken.

507
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,260
He was injured in a battle of wine and fire.

508
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,260
Impossible.

509
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,260
He was fine just now.

510
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,260
It's just that his stomach hurts a little.

511
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,260
He's not sick at all.

512
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,260
Right.

513
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,260
He's not sick at all.

514
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,260
He's not sick at all.

515
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,260
He's not sick at all.

516
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,260
He's not sick at all.

517
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:11,260
This child is just like Mu Xiaowu.

518
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,260
He's not saying anything.

519
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,260
Is there any way to cure him?

520
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,260
Yes.

521
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,260
What medicine do you need?

522
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,260
I'll think of a way to get it.

523
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,260
Cuiyu,

524
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,260
your water quality is good.

525
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,260
You can use medical skills to build a factory.

526
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:31,260
I have no other way to do it now.

527
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,260
Please save him.

528
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,260
Okay?

529
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,260
I'll go.

530
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,260
Prepare another room for me.

531
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,260
No one can come and disturb me.

532
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,260
I couldn't protect Mu Xiaowu before.

533
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,260
Can't I protect Yan's son?

534
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,260
Huai Zhu.

535
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,260
Yitan.

536
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,260
Don't blame yourself.

537
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,260
No matter what,

538
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:30,260
we've seen his medical skills.

539
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:32,260
We'll talk about it after Mu Mei is cured.

540
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,260
Cuiyu.

541
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,260
You know I can't cure him.

542
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,260
I can't do anything

543
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:25,260
about your medical skills.

544
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,260
Lan Yan.

545
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,260
Come out.

546
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,260
Come out!

547
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,260
Lan Yan.

548
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,260
I know you're here.

549
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,260
Come out!

550
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,260
If you don't come out,

551
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,260
Xiaomian will die.

552
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,260
He will die.

553
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,260
Do you know that?

554
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,260
What are you doing?

555
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,260
It's your turn to repay me.

556
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:11,260
I want you to sleep forever.

557
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:13,260
Don't wake up again.

558
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,260
All along,

559
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,260
we shared a body.

560
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,260
I was the only one

561
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,260
who could live.

562
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,260
I sealed Lan Yan

563
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,260
and took over the body.

564
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,260
I can't replace him.

565
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,260
If I want to replace Lan Yan again,

566
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,260
I have to disappear

567
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,260
and return the body to him.

568
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,260
Only in this way

569
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,260
can I save Xiaomian.

570
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,260
From the beginning to the end,

571
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:55,260
you love Lan Yan.

572
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,260
You love Lan Yan.

573
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:59,260
So I'm the one who's in need of you, right?

574
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,260
Xiaomian,

575
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,260
since when

576
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,260
did I start to like you?

577
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,260
Maybe

578
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:22,260
since you asked me

579
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,260
to be your girlfriend.

580
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,260
I was fooled.

581
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,260
What's so good about Xiaomian?

582
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,260
She's stupid and dumb.

583
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,260
But I still can't help

584
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,260
falling in love with you.

585
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,260
When I see you

586
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,260
talking to another woman,

587
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,260
I'll be angry.

588
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,260
Every time I see you,

589
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,260
I just want to scold you.

590
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,260
But why don't you understand

591
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,260
that I scold you

592
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,260
because I want to hear your reply?

593
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,260
Xiaomian,

594
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,260
I know

595
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:19,260
I'm arrogant and domineering.

596
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,260
I can't control myself.

597
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,260
I'm sorry.

598
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,260
If I force you,

599
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,260
you'll be unhappy, right?

600
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,260
So

601
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,260
I'm leaving.

602
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,260
From now on,

603
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,260
I'll let your favorite Lan Yan

604
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,260
stay with you.

605
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,260
Okay?

606
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,260
You sleep for a while.

607
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,260
Your Lan Yan

608
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,260
will be here soon.

609
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:23,260
The bright and bright sea of stars

610
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:28,260
is not the place to come back.

611
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:32,260
How can you see it clearly

612
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:36,260
that the flowers and flowers are blooming?

613
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,260
Like the wind and the flow of the wind.

614
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,260
It turns out that time has changed.

615
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:47,260
You and I have agreed to wait.

616
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,260
The wind and the flow of the wind

617
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,260
is not the place to come back.

618
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,260
I'll return your favorite person now.

619
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,260
But

620
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,260
you can't forget me.

621
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,260
Don't turn back and go.

622
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,260
The light is like a flash of light.

623
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:09,260
I like you.

624
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,260
It's you, Miss Houyuan.

625
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,260
What...

626
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,260
What did you say?

627
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,260
What did you say?

628
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,260
I like your domineering.

629
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,260
I like your straightforwardness.

630
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,260
I like you to tell me

631
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,260
everything you think.

632
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:33,260
You're not afraid of anything.

633
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:35,260
You don't care about anything.

634
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:37,260
You're the most

635
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,260
free person I've ever seen.

636
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,260
Although

637
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,260
sometimes

638
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:46,260
you're unreasonable,

639
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:50,260
I've never hated you.

640
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,260
I like you to scold me.

641
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,260
I don't mean I don't want to get back at you.

642
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,260
It's just...

643
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,260
It's just that

644
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:05,260
when I looked into your eyes,

645
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,260
my heart

646
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,260
was beating so fast.

647
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,260
All the words in my heart

648
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,260
I don't know how to tell you.

649
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,260
You asked me

650
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,260
who I liked.

651
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,260
You asked me to think about it.

652
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,260
I don't need to think about it.

653
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,260
I like you.

654
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,260
It's always you.

655
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,260
It's always you.

656
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,260
It's always you.

657
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,260
Why?

658
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,260
Why is it so late

659
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,260
in this world?

660
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,260
No.

661
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,260
No.

662
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,260
No, Miss.

663
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,260
No.

664
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,260
No.

665
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,260
No.

666
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,260
No.

667
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,260
No matter how late it is,

668
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,260
it's always you.

669
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,260
Little Cucumber.

670
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,260
Thank you for cheering me up.

671
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,260
I've been here

672
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,260
and never loved you.

673
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,260
No.

674
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,260
No.

675
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,260
Jin Chen Xi is complete.

676
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:50,260
As I expected,

677
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,260
Hong Yan gave up on himself.

678
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,260
I

679
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,260
didn't fail.

680
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,260
Save me.

681
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,260
Think about everything that happened in the underworld.

682
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,260
Think about the Jialan who killed you.

683
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,260
It's just to get out of Long Wen Xi's heart.

684
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,260
Don't let me down.

685
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:31,260
