1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,960
Their story is genuine einfach

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:15,340
It's a story that cannot be related with true things

3
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:33,860
Ah.

4
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:42,080
Ah.

5
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,340
What are you going out for?

6
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,340
To make an appointment.

7
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,340
It's so late.

8
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,340
Who are you going to meet?

9
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,340
A man.

10
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,340
Spray more.

11
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,340
Tell me.

12
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,340
What happened to you?

13
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,340
Cuihudo Miss.

14
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,340
Why are you coming to the village?

15
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,340
I came to the city of Biluo

16
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:53,340
to find my disciple, Xiao Tan.

17
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,340
I came to the city of Biluo to find out the news.

18
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,340
I met Sun Yuan Ji,

19
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,340
who broke his leg,

20
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,340
in the mountain of Baiyu Village.

21
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,340
I saved him and kept him in his house.

22
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,340
They are trying to harm me.

23
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:20,340
Here?

24
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,280
and send him to our carryover department in three days.

25
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,280
A monster from the water with such strong healing powers

26
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,120
Whoever sent it to Mada

27
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,980
The price of that monster should at least be good enough

28
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,340
What's the point of sending the demon to the inn?

29
00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:01,340
You can't ask her if you want to live longer.

30
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,340
Brother, look.

31
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,340
This water demon is so pretty.

32
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,340
No!!!!

33
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:34,340
Stay away from me.

34
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,340
Don't come near me.

35
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,340
Continue.

36
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,340
Sun family

37
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:04,340
Where did you send the three bitch?

38
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:11,340
They... They took me to the inn.

39
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,340
I was dazed and fainted.

40
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,340
I couldn't move.

41
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,340
But my mind was clear.

42
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,340
They put me in a big jar.

43
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,340
The liquid in that jar could silence me.

44
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,340
That liquid was very hot.

45
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,340
As hot as fire.

46
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,340
I could feel that the liquid in the soup

47
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:47,340
was absorbing my blood and my blood.

48
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:53,340
It absorbed another thing in my body.

49
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:57,340
It was very hot and very hot.

50
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,340
No.

51
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,340
No what?

52
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,340
I want to come here.

53
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,340
I don't want to die.

54
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,340
I want to live.

55
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,340
What do you want to live for?

56
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:11,340
To kill those who are cruel and cruel.

57
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:15,340
I just appeared at that time.

58
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:19,340
I ran away with Lanyan.

59
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,340
I only remember one thing.

60
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,340
Lanyan survived

61
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:28,340
to kill those cruel and cruel Sun family.

62
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,340
But he was too weak.

63
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,340
I just killed Sun Yuannin.

64
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,340
Lanyan woke up.

65
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,340
He...

66
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,340
He was like a mistake.

67
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,340
He ran away.

68
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,340
Yes.

69
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,340
I killed him.

70
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,340
I killed the village head's son.

71
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,340
I killed the village head's son.

72
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,340
But I don't regret at all.

73
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,340
Miss Cuiyu

74
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,340
must have been at the inn

75
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,340
and killed the man who was on the edge.

76
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,340
She killed another man.

77
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,340
So the key is

78
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,340
the inn.

79
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,340
Lanyan Inn.

80
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,340
Brother Yi, look.

81
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,340
The mark of the mask group.

82
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,340
Li Zipo of Wei family.

83
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,340
It's my brother.

84
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,340
Wei family has passed.

85
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,340
Where is my brother?

86
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,340
Cui.

87
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,340
Lu Yaoxi.

88
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,340
I'm not here to fight.

89
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,340
I'm here to see you.

90
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,340
I'm here to see you.

91
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,340
I'm here to see you.

92
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,340
Wang Quanhong told me that

93
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,340
as long as I show you this,

94
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,340
you will believe me.

95
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,340
So the key to everything

96
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,340
is the inn.

97
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,340
Jiuhuo used the life of a demon

98
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,340
to cultivate the broken pieces of the golden dust.

99
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,340
Cui Yu Mingluan escaped from there.

100
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,340
She is the last piece of golden dust.

101
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,340
So Jiuhuo must find her.

102
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,340
What's your plan?

103
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,340
Jiuhuo is not only a demon,

104
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,340
but also the god of the whole Bi Luo City.

105
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,340
You can't kill her

106
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,340
with your small resources.

107
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,340
Let Yang Yitan wear the explosion suit.

108
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,340
Tomorrow, we will trade with Jiuhuo

109
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,340
at the inn in the capital.

110
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,340
I will not only take you away,

111
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,340
but also let the whole Bi Luo City

112
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:32,340
know the true face of Jiuhuo.

113
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,340
Even if Jiuhuo's body is recovered,

114
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,340
we can't leave her body.

115
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,340
It's possible.

116
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,340
I didn't let her

117
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,340
die in the battle.

118
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,340
That's you.

119
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,340
The protection of the ancestral temple.

120
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,340
Lord Jiuhuo asked you to take this prisoner

121
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,340
to the temple.

122
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,340
Even if the golden dust is not complete,

123
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:12,340
it can't be used to exert its power.

124
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,340
I understand.

125
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,340
There is not much time left for the Seven Stars.

126
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,340
If we miss this chance,

127
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,340
we will have to wait until the next time.

128
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,340
The day we enter the temple,

129
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,340
it will be a hundred years.

130
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,340
Lord Jiuhuo.

131
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,340
The Seven Stars have arrived in three days.

132
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,340
Where is your man?

133
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:54,340
It seems that your life is not important

134
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,340
to those little bugs.

135
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,340
Give me a hand.

136
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,340
Lord Jiuhuo,

137
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,340
a letter from Yang Yi Tan

138
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:19,340
said that he was willing to exchange the Red Seal with Ming Luan.

139
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,340
The address is in Jinchen Inn.

140
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:29,340
I am willing to exchange the Red Seal with Wang Quan.

141
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,340
You don't have to go.

142
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,340
Ye Yuan.

143
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,340
I am here.

144
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,340
Bring Wang Quan and the Red Seal.

145
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,340
I will go to Jinchen Inn with you.

146
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,340
Lord Jiuhuo,

147
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,340
I proposed the strategy.

148
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,340
Bring him in.

149
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,340
Yes, sir.

150
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,340
Send the guard to the room.

151
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,340
Don't step out of the room.

152
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,340
If you betray me,

153
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,340
send a letter to me immediately.

154
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,340
Yes, sir.

155
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,340
We have the Red Seal you wanted.

156
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,340
We will exchange it.

157
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,340
Yes, sir.

158
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,340
I will go now.

159
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,340
Go.

160
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,340
Go.

161
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,340
Go.

162
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,340
Go.

163
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,340
Go.

164
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,340
Go.

165
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,340
Go.

166
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,340
Go.

167
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,340
Go.

168
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,340
Go.

169
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,340
Go.

170
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,340
Go.

171
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,340
Go.

172
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,340
Go.

173
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,340
Go.

174
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,340
Go.

175
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,340
Go.

176
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,340
Go.

177
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,340
Is it him?

178
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,340
It's the Water Demon.

179
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,340
In his body,

180
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:55,340
there is the last piece of Jinchen Seal that you want.

181
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,340
What is this Jinchen Seal?

182
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:01,340
What do you use it for?

183
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,340
If you want to know,

184
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:07,340
I will tell you today.

185
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,340
A thousand years ago,

186
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:15,340
a demon king named Hao Zhan appeared in my clan.

187
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,340
He had a magic weapon.

188
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:20,340
He used it to train his bones and blood.

189
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,340
It was connected to his soul.

190
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,340
This magic weapon was smooth and smooth.

191
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,340
It was like a golden city.

192
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,340
So, it was called the Jinchen Seal.

193
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,340
I have a question.

194
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,340
Do you hate me?

195
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,340
Of course not.

196
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:45,340
But how can I smell the fragrance of beauty?

197
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:01,340
You forced me to do all these.

198
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,340
You hate me.

199
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,340
You can hate me.

200
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,340
I should be able to hate you.

201
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,340
To eliminate hatred,

202
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:29,340
to pursue a power that makes you stronger.

203
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,340
So that's what it means.

204
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,340
The Demon King Hao Zhan

205
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,340
fought with the dragon tribe.

206
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,340
He was attacked by the dragon tribe.

207
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:47,340
He died in the river.

208
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:52,340
His body was submerged in the river.

209
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:56,340
The broken Jinchen Seal flew back to my capital.

210
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:59,340
It was buried in the pool of death.

211
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,340
This Jinshui

212
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:05,340
is the water that the Nying Lian tribe used to drink.

213
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:09,340
This Jinshui is the water that the Nying Lian tribe used to drink.

214
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,340
The blood and power of the Demon King

215
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:16,340
is the most powerful blood of the Demon King.

216
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:20,340
So you tricked the demons into the city of Biluocheng

217
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:23,340
and put them in this big tank.

218
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,340
You wanted to use the power of the demon elixir

219
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,340
to re-solve the Jinshui

220
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,340
and then make the broken Jinchen Seal

221
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,340
to repair the magic weapon.

222
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,340
So you did.

223
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,340
The Jinchen Seal's magic weapon

224
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,340
that was used to repair the demon elixir

225
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,340
is stronger than before.

226
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,340
You are indeed a smart person.

227
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,340
Do you know

228
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:55,340
who the person who found out my secret is?

229
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,340
The dead person.

230
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,340
We still have Cui Yu and Ming Luan.

231
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:04,340
Why do you think I want to exchange my knowledge with you?

232
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:11,340
Why do you think I want the living Demon of Water?

233
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,340
When did the seal come off?

234
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,340
After you said it.

235
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,340
Lord Jiuhuo.

236
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:57,340
I didn't ask you to stay in Biluocheng.

237
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,340
You can't go out.

238
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,340
I can't go out.

239
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,340
What about your demon?

240
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,340
I just want to know

241
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,340
why Lord Jiuhuo

242
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:06,340
doesn't allow me to come to the Jinchen Inn.

243
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,340
What secrets do I not know?

244
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,340
Stupid.

245
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,340
Let them come here.

246
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,340
Or I'll kill them.

247
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,340
Kill them?

248
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,340
Are you stupid?

249
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,340
I'm different from you.

250
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,340
I can do anything in front of Da Yi.

251
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,340
I can die with him.

252
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:27,340
But I will never let him

253
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,340
make a big mistake with you.

254
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,340
Then think about it.

255
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,340
Jialan.

256
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,340
Jialan.

257
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,340
Jialan.

258
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,340
Brother.

259
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,340
Brother, you're so good at this explosive.

260
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,340
The Jinchen Inn has been destroyed.

261
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:58,340
I'm afraid I can't keep the secret of Jiuhuo.

262
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:07,340
Do you think sister Huaiju remembered everything?

263
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,340
Where are you going?

264
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,340
Pottinggwan.

265
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:28,340
My brothers are the masters of the magic treasure.

266
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,340
They must have a way to get out

267
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,340
or control the demon in your body.

268
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:39,340
Dragon blood or dragon bone can control Jiuhuo.

269
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:44,340
This is the last thing I hid from you.

270
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,340
If you take me with you,

271
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,340
Jiuhuo will be chasing you.

272
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,340
Only when I go back,

273
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,340
will he relax.

274
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,340
Huaiju.

275
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,340
I'll wait for you to come back with dragon blood

276
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,340
in Biluo City.

277
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,340
Let's go now.

278
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,340
You don't care about sister Huaiju?

279
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:27,340
The most important thing now is to find dragon blood

280
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,340
and gather the power to deal with Jiuhuo.

281
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,340
As long as Jiuhuo can't break the circle,

282
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,340
Huaiju is safe.

283
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,340
I'll help you.

284
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:43,340
Yi Tan, Mr. Mu, come with me.

285
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:56,340
If you insist on taking me on an adventure,

286
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,340
I have to tell you something.

287
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,340
Go ahead.

288
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,340
My mother and I used to live in the mountains.

289
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,340
Since my mother passed away,

290
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,340
I've been doing well on my own.

291
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,340
I came to Biluo City

292
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,340
because I had a dream.

293
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,340
You're the only one in the Yang family

294
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,340
who can open the eyes of the heavens.

295
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:24,340
The dreams of the heavens are all real.

296
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,340
What did you dream about?

297
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:36,340
I dreamed of a man

298
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,340
who died digging his own eyes.

299
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,340
And that man...

300
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:48,340
That man is me, right?

301
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,340
My eyes are not stable.

302
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,340
Maybe I'm not sure.

303
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,340
I'm just worried.

304
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,340
I think that man is familiar.

305
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,340
That's why I came to Biluo City.

306
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,340
It's okay.

307
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,340
I'll try to be careful.

308
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,340
I won't let your dream come true.

309
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:11,340
Are you really not going to take me with you?

310
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,340
Maybe I can help you.

311
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,340
Your mother left the Yang family

312
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,340
to join the Yuyi Alliance.

313
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,340
We have nothing to do with each other.

314
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,340
You're Mu, not Yang.

315
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:26,340
You have to fulfill your parents' wishes.

316
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,340
You have to be an ordinary person

317
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:31,340
and live on forever.

318
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:43,340
Mu Min, don't take risks.

319
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,340
Don't fight with your family.

320
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,340
Go to the mountains and play with the water.

321
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,340
Go to the sky and see the land.

322
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:53,340
Go to see the real snow.

323
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,340
Go.

324
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,340
The future is the future.

325
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,340
I'll always love you.

326
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,340
Let's go.

327
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,340
Did you escape?

328
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,340
Yes.

329
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,340
I'm sorry.

330
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,340
I'm sorry.

331
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,340
I'm sorry.

332
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,340
I'm sorry.

333
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,340
Yes.

334
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,340
If you're a traitor, why did you come back?

335
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,340
I'm not a traitor.

336
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,340
You disobeyed me.

337
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,340
But you were treated as a hostage.

338
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:59,340
You let those little bugs get away with it.

339
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,340
You still say no.

340
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,340
I have.

341
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:14,340
You learned this from Wang Quanhong, right?

342
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,340
I just don't want to.

343
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,340
Don't want to?

344
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:23,340
I don't want to live in lies.

345
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:28,340
I want to know what I mean to you.

346
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:34,340
When Wang Quanhong mentioned Jialan,

347
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:39,340
you gave up on me and let me be taken away.

348
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:00,340
Sir, why did you get hurt for this traitor?

349
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:04,340
I was just trying to hide it from you.

350
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:07,340
I was trying to get in touch with you.

351
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:11,340
You have to understand that I don't want you to know too much.

352
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:16,340
Because to me, you're precious to the Mi Clan.

353
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,340
Really?

354
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,340
If you want to know,

355
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,340
I won't hide it from you anymore.

356
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,340
I'm not going to tell you anything.

357
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,340
I'm going to tell you everything.

358
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,340
Ye Yuan.

359
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,340
Yes, sir.

360
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,340
The Pottian Temple was already destroyed.

361
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,340
It's been 20 years.

362
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,340
It hasn't changed much.

363
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,340
Did you notify everyone?

364
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,340
I sent a letter to my brothers to explain the situation.

365
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,340
They asked them to wait for us at the Pottian Temple.

366
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:14,340
But the only person who replied to the letter was Li's family.

367
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,340
Let's go in and take a look.

368
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,340
Okay.

369
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,340
I'll go in and take a look.

370
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,340
Okay.

371
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,340
I'll go in and take a look.

372
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:27,340
I'll go in and take a look.

373
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,340
Okay.

374
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,340
It's still the same here.

375
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,340
I don't know how many years have passed.

376
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:49,340
What a good thing to see the broken faces of the Li's.

377
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:31,900
Away from me!

378
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,260
No...

379
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:44,620
No...

380
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,460
Bro..

381
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:50,380
Brother...

382
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:51,360
I...

383
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:54,200
Bro...

384
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,280
Are you...

385
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,680
How did I come back 20 years later?

386
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,720
Did I not dream?

387
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,840
Brother, your leg...

388
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,800
Why did it become like this?

389
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,840
Where are the others?

390
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,760
Where is my brother?

391
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,320
Texas?

392
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,120
I will send you a messenger,

393
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,960
based on this news.

394
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,380
In the future,

395
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,800
you will need me to Gene!

396
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,080
diesel!

397
00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:01,280
I'm the one who brought your bodies back.

398
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:08,280
I'm the one who brought your bodies back.

399
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:14,280
I'm the one who brought your bodies back.

400
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,280
Everyone.

401
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,280
How did you die?

402
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,280
I don't remember.

403
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,280
I don't remember.

404
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:34,280
Do you remember the nightmare?

405
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,280
There was a...

406
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,280
There was a...

407
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,280
A huge black tree.

408
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,280
Yes.

409
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,280
A huge black tree.

410
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:53,280
After I got close to that black tree,

411
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,280
I don't remember anything.

412
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,280
I don't remember.

413
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:01,280
Since you've entered my palace,

414
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,280
you should just stay here.

415
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,280
Brother.

416
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,280
God saved me.

417
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,280
God saved me.

418
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:23,280
I dreamed of someone who died in front of the god.

419
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,280
And that person...

420
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,280
It was me.

421
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,280
Everyone is dead.

422
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,280
Why did you let me live alone?

423
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,280
Why?

424
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,280
My lord.

425
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,280
Brother.

426
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,280
Brother.

427
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,280
After I came back,

428
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:09,280
I stayed in the Potei Pass for a year.

429
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,280
I made a coffin for you.

430
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,280
I know I should have come out.

431
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,280
But I couldn't.

432
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,280
I couldn't.

433
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,280
Where is Yi Wan Chong?

434
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,280
Take me there.

435
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,280
This is Wu Zi Bei.

436
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,280
He's a man of his word.

437
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,280
He's not a man of his words.

438
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:56,280
I think they hope so, too.

439
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:05,280
Masked Men were born to stop the fight between humans and demons.

440
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,280
Wearing masks, we follow our hearts.

441
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,280
We leave the limits of the human and demon world.

442
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,280
We follow the path of the hero.

443
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,280
The darkness is breaking through.

444
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,280
But we follow the light.

445
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:21,280
We have the blood of the people.

446
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:24,280
There's nothing we can't do.

447
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:33,280
How many years ago was this?

448
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,280
Eighteen years ago.

449
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,280
I was so selfish.

450
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:51,280
I hurt you all.

451
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,280
The way back.

452
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:21,280
I just want to follow my heart.

453
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:24,280
I follow the light.

454
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:27,280
I follow my heart.

455
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:30,280
I follow my heart.

456
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,280
I have three eyes.

457
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:38,280
So what I see is more complicated than yours.

458
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:43,280
Everything in the world has its own reason.

459
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,280
Twenty years after we crossed the line,

460
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:48,280
we saw our own ending.

461
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:51,280
The truth is getting closer and closer to Yong Ye.

462
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,280
There's a reason for that.

463
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:59,280
The reason is that we will change everything.

464
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,280
Yes, we can go back.

465
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,280
Everything starts from the beginning.

466
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,280
Change everything.

467
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:10,280
Brother, you can repair our magic and send us back.

468
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:14,280
This is the meaning of your life.

469
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,280
Yes.

470
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,280
I live until now.

471
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,280
Just to help you.

472
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,280
I'm sorry.

473
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,280
I'm sorry.

474
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,280
I'm sorry.

475
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,280
I'm sorry.

476
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,280
I'm sorry.

477
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,280
I'm sorry.

478
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,280
I'm sorry.

479
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,280
I'm sorry.

480
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,280
I'm sorry.

481
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,280
I'm sorry.

482
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,280
I'm sorry.

483
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,280
I'm sorry.

484
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,280
I'm sorry.

485
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,280
I'm sorry.

486
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,280
I'm sorry.

487
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,280
I'm sorry.

488
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,280
I'm sorry.

489
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,280
I'm sorry.

490
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,280
I'm sorry.

491
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,280
I'm sorry.

492
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,280
I'm sorry.

493
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,280
I'm sorry.

494
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,280
I'm sorry.

495
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,280
I'm sorry.

496
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,280
I'm sorry.

497
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,280
I'm sorry.

498
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,280
I'm sorry.

499
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,280
I'm sorry.

500
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,280
I'm sorry.

501
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,280
I'm sorry.

502
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,280
I'm sorry.

503
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,280
I'm sorry.

504
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,280
I'm sorry.

505
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,280
I'm sorry.

506
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,280
I'm sorry.

507
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,280
I'm sorry.

508
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,280
I'm sorry.

509
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,280
I'm sorry.

510
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,280
I'm sorry.

511
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,280
I'm sorry.

512
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,280
I'm sorry.

513
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,280
I'm sorry.

514
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,280
I'm sorry.

515
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,280
I'm sorry.

516
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,280
I'm sorry.

517
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,280
I'm sorry.

518
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,280
I'm sorry.

519
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,280
I'm sorry.

520
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,280
I'm sorry.

521
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,280
I'm sorry.

522
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,280
I'm sorry.

523
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,280
I'm sorry.

524
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,280
I'm sorry.

525
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,280
I'm sorry.

526
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,280
I'm sorry.

527
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,280
I'm sorry.

528
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,280
I'm sorry.

529
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,280
I'm sorry.

530
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,280
I'm sorry.

531
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,280
I'm sorry.

532
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,280
I'm sorry.

533
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,280
I'm sorry.

534
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,280
I'm sorry.

535
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,280
I'm sorry.

536
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,280
I'm sorry.

537
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,280
I'm sorry.

538
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,280
I'm sorry.

539
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,280
I'm sorry.

540
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,280
I'm sorry.

541
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,280
I'm sorry.
