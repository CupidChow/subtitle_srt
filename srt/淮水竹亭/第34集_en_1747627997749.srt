1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,900
Go!

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,960
Love is like a flame

3
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:11,720
The clouds are like the wind, the sky is like the sky

4
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,960
Don't look back, keep walking

5
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,760
Life and death are in front of you

6
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,280
From the fire to the fire

7
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,400
Whose love

8
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,040
is more beautiful than the universe

9
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,280
Don't look back, keep walking

10
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,160
Life and death are in front of you

11
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,640
From the fire to the fire

12
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,880
Whose love

13
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,600
is more beautiful than the universe

14
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,600
It's you and me

15
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,880
The Long Ballad

16
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,200
The rain of cherry blossoms is really refreshing

17
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,960
The real fruit invites you to watch the water-burning bamboo garden

18
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,960
Episode 2

19
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:04,160
The Long Ballad

20
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,720
Sister, look.

21
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,440
This is a farewell gift from Li Gou.

22
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,720
No matter where he is, he can send someone to 10 miles away with this.

23
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,680
Sister?

24
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,680
Sister,

25
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,620
I dreamt just now, right?

26
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,480
Father, he's not dead, right?

27
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,680
Qing Lan,

28
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,680
Listen to me.

29
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,400
I believe you will,

30
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,400
I'm telling you.

31
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,600
Father has died.

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,400
You have to leave.

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I won't leave.

34
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,200
I want to avenge my father.

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
If you stay,

36
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,400
we'll just sit here and wait.

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,200
You have to leave.

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,400
Then let's leave together.

39
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,000
This is what I found out from your room a while ago.

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Now it's yours.

41
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,400
I'm sorry, Qinglan.

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,400
I was too strict with you.

43
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
From now on,

44
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,200
you can only remember what I did to you.

45
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,800
These two candies

46
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,200
are originally for you.

47
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,800
You're too sweet.

48
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,600
I think you might like it

49
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,000
if you eat something sweet.

50
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,800
People who like candy are soft-hearted.

51
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,800
Wen Qinglan

52
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,800
will be so crazy and heartless in the future.

53
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,200
Sister,

54
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,600
I can't leave you alone.

55
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
After you go out,

56
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,800
you can beg me.

57
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,200
Yes, I can go to my brother-in-law.

58
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,400
Hongye's power

59
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,400
is so strong.

60
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,200
I can't leave you alone.

61
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,000
I can go to Ruyi Pavilion.

62
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,800
There are many branch stores in Ruyi Pavilion.

63
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,600
Qinglan is smart.

64
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,800
But you have to remember

65
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,600
that your own safety is more important

66
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,200
than the news.

67
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,400
Qinglan's happiness

68
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,600
is more important than hatred.

69
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:23,200
I bet all the invaders

70
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,800
will be에

71
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,200
depressed and upset.

72
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,400
By the time he gets out,

73
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,600
the Eastern kingdom

74
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,600
Duygusal

75
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,800
Don't cry

76
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,120
I am happy

77
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,560
For your recovery

78
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,360
The Arched one sounds so sweet

79
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,320
I think

80
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,120
The sour one

81
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,600
Sister probably likes it

82
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,440
ni

83
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,080
Little sister

84
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:40,020
Sister lovesient

85
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,440
Another time.

86
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,560
If anything was going to happen once or twice,

87
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,900
you'd have Par Stair novelty.

88
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,180
Yes, at that.

89
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:03,080
I would trust the security of Southern씌域.

90
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,860
You would help us get the six units down there.

91
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,760
How did the south

92
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,100
is reacting.

93
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,720
I'm going to catch him in the sauce.

94
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:26,160
The

95
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:30,820
day

96
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,520
new

97
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:46,020
desire

98
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,020
were caused by you.

99
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,420
You killed them.

100
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,220
You made them die in the dark.

101
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,620
You were not good enough.

102
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,020
I'm sorry.

103
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,020
Qu Zhuo,

104
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,020
I've collected over a thousand talismans

105
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,420
and put them under your bed.

106
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,220
Are you trying to take off your clothes?

107
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,220
Are you going to give me

108
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,020
your thousand talismans

109
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,820
or give me your thousand talismans?

110
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,820
What are you talking about?

111
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,820
If you dare to die in front of me,

112
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,620
I'll give you your thousand talismans.

113
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,420
You're really a puppy.

114
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,220
Qu Zhuo,

115
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,620
Zhuo,

116
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,220
listen to me.

117
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,420
Take this talisman away.

118
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,020
Let me go in and see you.

119
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,420
Let me see you, okay?

120
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,620
Mother,

121
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,220
I've lost your eldest brother.

122
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,020
I can't lose you again.

123
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,620
It's all Wang Quanhong's fault.

124
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,220
He caused me,

125
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,620
caused my two sons to die.

126
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,820
I'll be with him

127
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,220
for the rest of my life.

128
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,020
I'll kill him.

129
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,420
Don't blame my eldest brother.

130
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,220
It's not his fault.

131
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:56,820
Zhuo,

132
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,220
okay, okay.

133
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,020
I'll listen to you.

134
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,420
I'll listen to you.

135
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,820
As long as you can let me

136
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,220
go in and see you.

137
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,420
Zhuo,

138
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,020
listen to your mother.

139
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,020
Open the door.

140
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,420
Let's go in.

141
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,220
Yes, Zhuo.

142
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,620
You guys,

143
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,620
let me be alone.

144
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,220
Let's go.

145
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,620
I'll give you this.

146
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,020
When you meet a girl you like,

147
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,620
give this to her.

148
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,620
I'm Li Quzhuo, the second son of Tao Yuan Li family.

149
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,020
Quzhuo?

150
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,820
Stop it, Quzhuo.

151
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:24,820
Guess what?

152
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,820
What?

153
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,420
He ran away with her

154
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,220
when he was about to give her the key.

155
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,620
Really?

156
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:35,220
One night, the rain fell.

157
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,420
Three thousand winds and rain fell.

158
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:41,020
Three thousand winds and rain fell.

159
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:43,020
Welcome to the big house.

160
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,220
The rain was too strong.

161
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,820
You and I, who were young,

162
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:53,020
opened our eyes and looked at the sky.

163
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:57,820
We saw the face of the river.

164
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,220
We parted.

165
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,020
Come on, come on.

166
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:00,420
Let's drink.

167
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,420
Let's drink.

168
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,020
Let's drink.

169
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,020
Let's drink.

170
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,020
Let's drink.

171
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:04,820
Come on.

172
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,020
Cheers.

173
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,620
Big brother, big sister-in-law,

174
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,020
I'll be your master

175
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,220
when you get married.

176
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,420
There are so many brothers here.

177
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,820
It's your turn.

178
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,420
Can you drink?

179
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,620
Li Gou.

180
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,620
Li Gou.

181
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:31,020
Three cups of wine.

182
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,620
You guys, let's go out and fight.

183
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,620
Hurry up.

184
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,220
Let's go.

185
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,220
Let's go.

186
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,220
Let's go.

187
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,220
Let's go.

188
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,220
Let's go.

189
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,220
Let's go.

190
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,220
Let's go.

191
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,220
Let's go.

192
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,220
Let's go.

193
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,220

Let's go.

214
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,020

Since when did it happensuspensefully?

217
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,780
Life is short,

218
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,140
it can feel like an ending.

219
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,280
When you're having a happy time, you lots get drunk together.

220
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,420
When you're Have Something on your mind and not get tables full of your separate things.

00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:08,420
Others may be better.

224

Of course.

231
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,480
The purpose of our mask group

232
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,680
is to break all the rules

233
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,280
and challenge everything.

234
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,720
Stop the fight between human and demon.

235
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,760

Kill the black tiger.

237
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,440
Although the target is drifting,

238
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,000
I believe

239
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,840
in you, Da Yan.

240
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,280

Come on.

244
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:41,240
Wait.

245
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,280
Black Tiger's strength is terrible.

246
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,080
We can't let everyone's efforts go in vain.

247
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,080
Young people,

248
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,880
the result of facing the dark dark queen

249
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,280
is something you can't bear.

250
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,080
The red leaves of the desert,

251
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,880
I can see the fear in your heart.

252
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,480
What you love is destined to be empty.

253
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,080
All the real things are empty.

254
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,080
You can't see them.

255
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,880
All the struggles are empty.

256
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,680
Destiny can't be changed.

257
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,080
You are the one who found the human heart.

258
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,680
Where can you find it?

259
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,280
What's the Swiftest scowl?

260
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,080
They are all dead.

261
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,080
You didn't protect them.

262
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,040
The

263
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,040
Miss.

264
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:58,040
You locked yourself in the room and didn't come out.

265
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,040
Why are you doing this?

266
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:04,000
Senior Brother has prepared a wedding dress for you.

267
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It's a custom-made wedding dress specially made for you from Tiancang Pavilion.

268
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It's beautiful and beautiful.

269
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It's very expensive.

270
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
It will never insult your identity as the First Miss.

271
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I know.

272
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Put it at the door.

273
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Miss.

274
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
My earring.

275
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Why haven't I heard the voice of the Second Miss?

276
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,960
Qinglan was sick a few days ago.

277
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,960
Imperial Concubine Yu is taking care of him.

278
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,960
You are so sensible.

279
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,960
You know that the situation is better than people.

280
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,960
I put the dress at the door.

281
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,960
Hurry and come out and take it.

282
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,960
Why are you still pretending to be a high-ranking official?

283
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,920
How did you talk to the Miss of the Fire Tribe?

284
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,920
Senior Brother.

285
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,920
Junior Sister.

286
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,920
I treat you sincerely.

287
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,920
I don't want to force you.

288
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:19,920
I know that you are still looking forward to the death of Wang Quanhong.

289
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,920
The First Qi Alliance has the latest news.

290
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,880
The eight people in the mask group are out of the circle.

291
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,880
They are all out of the circle.

292
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,880
None of them are alive.

293
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,880
Junior Sister.

294
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,880
Wang Quanhong will not come.

295
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,880
If you continue to be so stubborn,

296
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,880
what are the benefits for you and Junior Sister?

297
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,880
Xiaodong.

298
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,880
Yes.

299
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,880
The First Miss must be satisfied with any orders.

300
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,880
Yes.

301
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,880
I will go.

302
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,880
Yes.

303
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,880
I will go.

304
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,880
I will go.

305
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,880
I will go.

306
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,880
I will go.

307
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,020
But what

308
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:08,680
should I show

309
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,520
to them?

310
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:13,640
There is now a missing note at the heart.

311
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:17,160
This is no more than one year.

312
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:27,720
Ex sings.

313
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,720
Then all are still present at the heart.

314
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,720
You can't journalist these things anymore.

315
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,740
A One-ud hacia a Two One E Shore

316
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,140

318
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,560
Don't worry

319
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:51,780
It's долж

320
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:52,720

324
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,080
I'm just wondering

325
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,120
who's got the sea

326
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:58,880

Don't let him get away!

335
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Miss Qin Lan,

336
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,280
Master Qin has already guessed

337
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,800
that you are going to Ruyi House.

338
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,120
We have already arranged it.

339
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,840
Just go back with us.

340
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,120
You have mistaken me.

341
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,720
Miss Qin Lan,

342
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,920
just go back with us.

Go after her!

346
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,800
Move aside!

347
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,800

to keep you safe and give you good luck?

00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,720
You can also give it to your lover

as a token of your love.

356
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,320

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,120
This is for you.

00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,320
and be safe.

369
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,720
Move aside!

370
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,720

00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,040
Over there!

385
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,200
Hurry up!

386
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,560
You...

387
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,640
Miss Qin Lai,

388
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,280
how did you escape?

389
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,000
It seems that the master doesn't know.

390
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,040
But fortunately, the master was prepared

391
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,280
and kept an eye on us.

392
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:47,960
You're a loser!

393
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,920
Who do you think is the master?

394
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,880
That bastard Jin Renfu?

395
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,160
He's a loser too!

396
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,680
Miss Qin Lai,

397
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,320
it's pointless to say more.

398
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,080
You'd better leave with us.

399
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,440
Boss,

400
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,240
we forced Miss Qin Lai to die.

401
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,440
Miss Huai Zhu won't give up easily.

402
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,640
By then,

403
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,360
Jin Renfeng will definitely

404
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,200
punish us

405
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,560
for helping Miss Huai Zhu.

406
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,640
You know

407
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,960
how to deal with Jin Renfeng.

408
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,600
If you want to live,

409
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,840
listen to me.

410
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,560
Today,

411
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,600
we didn't see Miss Qin Lai.

412
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,480
Let's go.

413
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,840
I'll wait for you.

414
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,240
It's end of the line.

415
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,160
Qin Lai,

416
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,360
are you all right?

417
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,680
And...

418
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,040
You.

419
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,720
I have no choice.

420
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,720
Since you're back safely,

421
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,720
I think it's time to arrange a ceremony

422
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:13,720
to announce that you are officially married.

423
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,720
Young Master,

424
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,720
even if you don't think about yourself,

425
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,720
don't you think about Miss Huai Ru?

426
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,720
Since you came back,

427
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,720
I sent a letter to the Fire Tribe

428
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,720
as soon as I got the message.

429
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,720
But the person who sent the letter

430
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,720
didn't see Miss Huai Ru.

431
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,720
Catch Dong Feng and Huai Ru!

432
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,720
Don't let them get away!

433
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,720
Go! Go!

434
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,720
Go! Go!

435
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,720
Junior, why are you so stubborn?

436
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,720
The Snake Fire Manor has long been taken by the people.

437
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,720
What can you do alone?

438
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,720
Those who know the truth are the most powerful.

439
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,720
Junior, please stop playing the zither.

440
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,720
I've been devising a plan for a long time.

441
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,720
Please give me your blessing.

442
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,720
You despicable person!

443
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,720
The king of the city is defeated.

444
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,720
How despicable?

445
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,720
Senior, I'm really convinced of you.

446
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,720
I didn't notice that you were secretly sent out.

447
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,720
But it doesn't matter.

448
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,720
I'm not so anxious to find you.

449
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,720
Because I care more about you.

450
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,720
Shameless!

451
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,720
Junior, Junior,

452
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,720
you can't go on like this.

453
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,720
We're in the same boat.

454
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,720
Senior still has mercy on you.

455
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,720
He didn't poison you.

456
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,720
You'll lose too much blood.

457
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,720
You'll become a demon.

458
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,720
You'll start to disobey the order.

459
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,720
In no time,

460
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,720
my wish will be fulfilled.

461
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,720
From now on,

462
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,720
you're mine.

463
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,720
The doctor

464
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,720
is starting to blur.

465
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,720
His hand

466
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,720
can't be raised anymore.

467
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,720
He's like that Huai Water

468
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,720
and that bamboo forest.

469
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,720
But I really want to see you again.

470
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,720
See you in the clouds.

471
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,720
Come back.

472
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,720
When you come back,

473
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,720
we still have a lot of things

474
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,720
to do together.

475
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,720
Wait for me to come back.

476
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,720
What's wrong?

477
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,720
The gate of the manor has been opened.

478
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,720
This sword...

479
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:32,720
I'll never stop missing you.

480
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,720
I'll give you a whole sky of tenderness.

481
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,720
When I look up, I can see

482
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,720
that even though time has passed,

483
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,720
I can still see the stars.

484
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:48,720
Love has finally come to an end.

485
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:53,720
I'll wipe away all the impurities.

486
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,720
I'll give you a lifetime of joy.

487
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,720
Even if we forget the past,

488
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,720
I'll watch the world go by.

489
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,720
I'll take your eyes away

490
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:07,720
and look at you with my own eyes.

491
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:28,720
I'll wipe away all the impurities.

492
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,720
I'll give you a lifetime of joy.

493
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,720
Even if we forget the past,

494
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,720
I'll watch the world go by.

495
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,720
I'll take your eyes away

496
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,720
and look at you with my own eyes.

497
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,720
I'll take your eyes away

498
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,720
and look at you with my own eyes.

499
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,720
I'll take your eyes away

500
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,720
and look at you with my own eyes.

501
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,720
I'll take your eyes away

502
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,720
and look at you with my own eyes.

503
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,720
I'll take your eyes away

504
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,720
and look at you with my own eyes.

505
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,720
I'll take your eyes away

506
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,720
and look at you with my own eyes.

507
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,720
I'll take your eyes away

508
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,720
and look at you with my own eyes.

509
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,720
I'll take your eyes away

510
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,720
and look at you with my own eyes.

511
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,720
I'll take your eyes away

512
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,720
and look at you with my own eyes.

513
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,720
I'll take your eyes away

514
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,720
and look at you with my own eyes.
