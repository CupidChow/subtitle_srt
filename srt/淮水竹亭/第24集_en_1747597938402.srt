1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
The peace of the universe

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,160
Love and hate are both

3
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,040
Flowing

4
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,520
The clouds are like the wind

5
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,680
Chatting like a butterfly

6
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,920
Don't turn back and keep walking

7
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,760
Life and death are in front of you

8
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,240
From the fire to the fire

9
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,480
Whose love

10
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,040
Is more beautiful than the universe

11
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,280
Don't turn back and keep walking

12
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,120
Life and death are in front of you

13
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,600
From the fire to the fire

14
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,840
Whose love

15
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,560
Is more beautiful than the universe

16
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,560
It's you and me

17
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,160
The Long Ballad

18
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,320
Vixi La Man, sing loudly

19
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,600
Maidong wants you to watch

20
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,880
Huai Shui Zhu Ting

21
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,360
Next, we have the second son of the Tao Yuan Li family,

22
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,920
the genius Li Qu Zhuo.

23
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,920
He will report to everyone

24
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,320
our investigation results.

25
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,520
Sister, have some of this grape fruit.

26
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,960
Li Gou, you're almost done.

27
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,240
Let's get down to business.

28
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,520
We have to find the second son

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,960
of the Tao Yuan.

30
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,760
We found a swallow

31
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,720
under the help of Qin Lan.

32
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,120
We found a swallow.

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,840
I put three talismans on it.

34
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,120
So we found his old servant,

35
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,400
Li Yuan.

36
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,240
The other son is the soul-chilling demon.

37
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,080
He's called Pingtou Ge.

38
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,920
His nickname is not dead.

39
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,500
Have someテ

40
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,640
And find me some new demons

41
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,920
Its price is still får

42
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,960
You all take over.

43
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,120
Yes.

44
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,240
It should be said that

45
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:34,040
if I see my soul

46
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,240
hiding in a fallen monster

47
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,240
the demon will not dare to do that.

48
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,680
Not a single creature

49
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,580
can use magic.

50
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,240
But I never thought

51
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,160
these twelve demons

52
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,640
would each hold one of my Knap DO friend.

53
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,640
I'm not afraid of you.

54
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,840
You didn't say that when you threatened me.

55
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,880
The Vengeance Qi is in the hands of someone you trust.

56
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,160
If you die,

57
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,520
she will reveal the secret immediately.

58
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:09,040
You did everything for that dead Young Master Zhang.

59
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,240
I have to keep an eye on you.

60
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,800
Then let's cut the crap.

61
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,440
I won't take any more threats

62
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,040
if you do what you did

63
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,760
when you killed Wang Quan and Hongye.

64
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,080
You don't care about the lives of the Zhang family?

65
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,840
If Wang Quan and Hongye know that you are my son,

66
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,080
how will they treat the Zhang family?

67
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,840
Have you thought about it?

68
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,520
Wang Quan and Hongye

69
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,280
came to the Demon Kingdom secretly.

70
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,840
What is the reason behind it?

71
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,880
Have you thought about it?

72
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,640
Could it be that they came to investigate you?

73
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,360
What did you tell him?

74
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,760
Nothing.

75
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,240
It's just a guess.

76
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,280
But you know that

77
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,360
Wang Quan and Hongye are very smart

78
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,360
and very cunning.

79
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,840
If you don't kill him today,

80
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,160
will he let you and the Zhang family go?

81
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,040
Do you think so?

82
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,480
Ran,

83
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,280
I'm sorry to you.

84
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,400
But Young Master Zhang is grateful to you.

85
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,840
Okay.

86
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,840
I will kill Wang Quan and Hongye.

87
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,240
But from now on,

88
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,520
you are the State Preceptor of the Demon Kingdom.

89
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,520
I'm Zhang Zheng, the Black Sword.

90
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,240
I'm waiting for your answer.

91
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,880
The spies of the Demon Kingdom

92
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,200
have been looking for Wang Quan and Hongye.

93
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,680
They will inform you as soon as they hear about it.

94
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,600
You must be hungry after talking for so long.

95
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,520
Do you want to stay

96
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,800
and have the last meal with me?

97
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,520
The last time I cooked for you

98
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,320
was more than 20 years ago.

99
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,160
It would be great if the young master Zhang was alive.

100
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,160
He is so kind.

101
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,560
He will definitely persuade you to agree.

102
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,160
Okay.

103
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,960
After eating the meal cooked by me,

104
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,880
you will always be my wife.

105
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:25,080
Les chirping,

106
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,280
Snake Monster?

107
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,040
We don't want your life.

108
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,520
Tell me, where are the killers?

109
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,720
Do you think you can get away?

110
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,840
What are you waiting for?

111
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,240
Think about the consequences of your information!

112
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,520
Hmph!

113
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,700
The medicine produced in the dungeon

114
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,580
is the expel medicine.

115
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,380
It consumes a lot.

116
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,480
You're running out of hives.

117
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,180
I can't die yet.

118
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,340
If I die,

119
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:19,520
these boatwios will float out to the ground and refuse to be shot.

120
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,980
I don't even know how I'll die.

121
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,920
You grope in Zone 3

122
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,380
just to save the !!!

123
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,380
Tell me where the killer is.

124
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:30,380
I'll pretend that I haven't been here.

125
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,380
You've seen our skills.

126
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,380
You have no other choice.

127
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:58,380
Is it here?

128
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,380
It's you.

129
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:39,380
Master Zhang, you assassinated me in the Demon Kingdom.

130
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,380
Are you trying to betray the entire Yiqi Alliance?

131
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,380
I'm not.

132
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,380
I'm just a nobody.

133
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,380
I'm just a nobody.

134
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,380
I'm just a nobody.

135
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,380
I'm just a nobody.

136
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,380
Are you trying to betray the entire Yiqi Alliance?

137
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,380
I don't understand what you're talking about.

138
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:02,380
Since you don't understand, show me your leg wound.

139
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:15,380
Do you think you can escape?

140
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,380
Brother!

141
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,380
This has nothing to do with him.

142
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,380
I'll go with you.

143
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:51,380
So the one that Miss Qi Mu cares about is Master Zhang, right?

144
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,380
Zhang Zheng, the Black Sword,

145
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,380
to fight for the world's first sword,

146
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,380
he's always against Wang Quan's Manor.

147
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,380
That day, Ruyi Pavilion assassinated me.

148
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,380
Do you know about it?

149
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,380
I do.

150
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,380
What else are you hiding from me?

151
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,380
Brother.

152
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:12,380
If I say that Zhang Zheng assassinated you for a reason,

153
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,380
can you let him go?

154
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,380
You already know that I won't let him go.

155
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,380
That's why you rushed over tonight

156
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,380
to save him.

157
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,380
Brother, you said it too.

158
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,380
I'm not going to let him go.

159
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,380
I'm not going to let him go.

160
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,380
I'm not going to let him go.

161
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,380
I'm not going to let him go.

162
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,380
I'm not going to let him go.

163
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,380
I'm not going to let him go.

164
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,380
I'm not going to let him go.

165
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,380
Brother, you said it too.

166
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,380
He's always against Wang Quan.

167
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,380
He's the biggest opponent of Yi Qi Sect.

168
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,380
So what?

169
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,380
So you think that I won't let him go

170
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,380
if I know his secret?

171
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,380
You think I won't let the whole Zhang family go?

172
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,380
You...

173
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,380
In your heart,

174
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,380
Brother is that kind of person, right?

175
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,380
Brother,

176
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,380
I really like him.

177
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,380
I'll tell you everything

178
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,380
I know right now.

179
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,380
That's the way it is.

180
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,380
I want to save him.

181
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,380
I want to kill An Nanyan.

182
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,380
Zhang Zheng must have something to do with him.

183
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,380
But An Nanyan won't be so stupid

184
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,380
to take the evidence with him.

185
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,380
He should be giving the evidence to someone.

186
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,380
Once he's dead,

187
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,380
the evidence will be released immediately.

188
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,380
You've already ordered for a killing.

189
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,380
The reward is ten thousand taels.

190
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,380
I'll send the order back immediately.

191
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,380
I'll tell Yi Tan right away.

192
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,380
You start your information network

193
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,380
to track down all An Nanyan's movements.

194
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,380
If he's not a person,

195
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,380
he's very likely to be hiding in the medical equipment.

196
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,380
Find someone to investigate.

197
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,380
We'll give you information.

198
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,380
Finally, I have something to do.

199
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,380
Tell me.

200
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,380
Who is the big boss?

201
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,380
Why do you need me to help?

202
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,380
He said he wanted us to find someone

203
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,380
who's hiding in the medical equipment.

204
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,380
This person has Zhang Zheng's evidence.

205
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,380
Black Sword Zhang Zheng?

206
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,380
When did my brother

207
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,380
get together with him?

208
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,380
I'm hungry.

209
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,380
Are you hungry?

210
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,380
Eat.

211
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,380
Why?

212
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,380
Are you thinking of how to kill me

213
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,380
and bringing me a meal?

214
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,380
There's no bamboo shoots in here.

215
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,380
Zhang Zheng.

216
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,380
Meng Xuanhong.

217
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,380
What do you want?

218
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,380
Am I in your heart

219
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,380
such a

220
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,380
despicable person?

221
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,380
Dongfang Huai Zhu is the sword master

222
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,380
of the Nangong family.

223
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,380
The Nangong family's mutiny

224
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,380
was done by you two.

225
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,380
You still remember.

226
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,380
You still remember.

227
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,380
It seems that

228
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,380
you're not only worried about Qingmu Garden

229
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,380
but also Zhang family.

230
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,380
You've become the second Nangong.

231
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,380
I have a question for you.

232
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,380
Go ahead.

233
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,380
Nangong has pulled you many times.

234
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,380
You have many chances to use the demon elixir

235
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,380
to surpass me and become the best sword in the world.

236
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,380
Why did you refuse?

237
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,380
I want to defeat you.

238
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,380
But Black Sword

239
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,380
must be Black Sword.

240
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,380
Is it because

241
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,380
that person used his own life

242
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,380
to give you the order?

243
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,380
Wu Mei told me

244
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,380
your secret.

245
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,380
I have another thing

246
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,380
that I just got.

247
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,380
Your hand.

248
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,380
A Na Yan is very crafty.

249
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,380
The seller

250
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,580
asked the Zhang family to write this

251
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,580
elixir to you.

252
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,580
The Zhang family used fake name,

253
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,580
but when we compare the handwriting,

254
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,580
we can see

255
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,580
who wrote it.

256
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,580
Hong Jun Hong Yan,

257
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,580
what do you want to do?

258
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:30,260
You've been threatened by this thing for so long.

259
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:37,780
No matter what, I won't be threatened by you anymore.

260
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:00,580
I really don't understand you.

261
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:04,580
If I say that I've always been very lucky to have someone by my side

262
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:09,580
who can surpass me at any time like you, will you believe me?

263
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:16,580
It seems that you don't believe me.

264
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:23,580
Then can this gift change the next chance for you to understand me?

265
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:31,580
The wontons are cold. Hurry and eat.

266
00:17:55,580 --> 00:18:00,580
In the Yiqi Alliance, the Wangquan Sword is more powerful than the Yuzhong Sword.

267
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,580
The Black Sword is stronger than the Baojing Sword.

268
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:08,580
These two never conflict.

269
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,580
You really let me go?

270
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:21,580
I know that you've already become a sword. You won't change easily.

271
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:24,580
But I still want to see you.

272
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:29,580
But I still hope that you can understand my intentions.

273
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:41,580
If I'm not wrong, this jade pendant was given to you by Young Master, right?

274
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:49,580
Young Master is such a good person. The last thing he left for you will never be a lock.

275
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:56,580
Don't feel guilty. This is all my own choice.

276
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,580
It has nothing to do with you.

277
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:03,580
I hope that you can continue to live well.

278
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,580
Take good care of yourself.

279
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:13,580
You're doing well.

280
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,580
You're the only thing I want.

281
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,580
I'm sorry.

282
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:33,580
The red-sword of the Wangquan Sword was given to you by me.

283
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:37,580
It should be given to you by the King.

284
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:41,580
He's the leader of the Drunken Dragon House. He's been picking out demons lately.

285
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,580
He's doing something very dangerous.

286
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,580
I already have a clue about this.

287
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:51,580
Zhang Zheng, can I ask you to do me a favor? What is it?

288
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:57,580
Zhang Zheng is quite good.

289
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,580
Is he better than me?

290
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,580
He and Qingmu Yuan are a good match.

291
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,580
Then why didn't my sister come by herself?

292
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:15,580
Sometimes, they have to think it through themselves.

293
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:44,580
You have a good taste.

294
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,680
Xia Babuffin.

295
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:22,320
The black

296
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:31,580
My Lady, what are you looking at?

297
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,580
It's nothing.

298
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,700
Get a drink after the meal tomorrow.

299
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,220
I'll buy you some.

300
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:39,740
Thanks.

301
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,060
Didn't you say that your girlfriend's girlfriend is going out marks'

302
00:21:42,660 --> 00:22:02,480
wouldn't she be

303
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,560
You...

304
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,520
He contour my entire body.

305
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,840
79g of blood.

306
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,920
Stop.

307
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,400
Hurry up.

308
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,200
But...

309
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,480
I used insbesondere phlegm against you, right?

310
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,360
Yes.

311
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,280
I'm Young Master's escapee.

312
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,600
There's more?

313
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,040
What?

314
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,680
Now I know why you're not interested in me

315
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,640
after going out of your inner circle,

316
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,800
it feels too much...?

317
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,240
Give me the way.

318
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:12,880
Changzheng.

319
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,000
Changzheng.

320
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:14,940
What's wrong with you?

321
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,280
Changzheng.

322
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,820
I'm ici posed to

323
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,040
death in aă 무ニ'owed Poison.

324
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,280
Same color as me.

325
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,200
The poison is all over now.

326
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,280
How can you die like this?

327
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,200
Zhang Zheng!

328
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,520
To poison the heart,

329
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,720
I can't even cure the poison

330
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,240
after taking you back to the palace.

331
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,400
Zhang Zheng!

332
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,760
Ye Xiang.

333
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,000
This is the only way

334
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,480
to cure the bloodthirsty enemy.

335
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,760
I can only trade blood with him

336
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,880
to take the poison into my body.

337
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,240
Before the poison enters the human heart,

338
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,800
I must find a way to suppress it.

339
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,120
Hmph.

340
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,080
Zhang Zheng.

341
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,720
I want you to hold me forever.

342
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,120
Hmph.

343
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,480
What happened again?

344
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,320
Be careful.

345
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,720
What?

346
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,040
You're more interested in this

347
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,960
than me.

348
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,800
Why are you jealous?

349
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,240
I always have you in my heart.

350
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:47,880
Forget it.

351
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,440
I've seen you through.

352
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,520
You just dare to come to me

353
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,000
without Miss Huai Zhou.

354
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,320
You're just afraid that people will find out

355
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,920
and stop you from pursuing your dream.

356
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,360
You're thinking too much.

357
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,840
I have a way

358
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,360
to get rid of the enemy.

359
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,200
What's your way?

360
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,720
Tell me.

361
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,400
Is it this?

362
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,320
I'll tell you next time.

363
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,120
It's getting late.

364
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,880
Okay, I'll listen to you.

365
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,120
You're my favorite person.

366
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,480
You can study it.

367
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,960
It's a very high-quality hairpin.

368
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,680
It's repaired so quickly.

369
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,200
It's a man's hairpin.

370
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,720
Is it you, Lord Jiuhuo?

371
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,040
That An Nanyan is not doing well.

372
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,080
Go to the Demon Kingdom to see her.

373
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,720
Yes.

374
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,000
The Demon Kingdom

375
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,680
What do you want to tell me?

376
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:30,920
Tell me.

377
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:33,960
Does Qin Lan

378
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,840
love you very much?

379
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,400
Nonsense.

380
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,240
What if there's a person

381
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,520
that your sister likes very much

382
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,000
but you don't like?

383
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,160
What will you do?

384
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,600
Then answer my questions first.

385
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,120
Do you know what my sister likes to eat?

386
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,640
Ying Gao and fish.

387
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,800
What is she good at?

388
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,120
She doesn't know how to play the piano and calligraphy.

389
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,400
She doesn't like to be a teacher.

390
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,200
She doesn't know how to cook and wash clothes.

391
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:02,320
But she likes to fight and fight.

392
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,400
Very good.

393
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,360
Then do you know why she doesn't fight easily?

394
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,320
Because the God Fire Manor has subdued her.

395
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,360
Although she is a good person,

396
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,800
I still care about her.

397
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,800
If you two are together,

398
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,720
your Wang Quan sword

399
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,600
and her Dongfang Lingxian

400
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,040
are both a burden

401
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,400
to you two.

402
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
The reason I like the leader of the Masked Club

403
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,120
is because my sister likes it.

404
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,040
She is so loyal.

405
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,440
In fact, she longs for

406
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,680
that freedom and freedom.

407
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,360
Do you understand?

408
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,160
I do.

409
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,120
Qian Lan really loves her.

410
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,040
Now you can give up on her.

411
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,040
Now I have to give up on her.

412
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,600
Why are you always so stubborn?

413
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,840
Because I also love bad things.

414
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,200
I can give her

415
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,360
what she wants.

416
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,400
Dongfang Ummu

417
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,560
I cannot.

418
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,080
I'm afraid that she'll avoid me

419
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,320
and leave me alone.

420
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,040
Do you think

421
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,200
that by myself

422
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,480
I can cooperate with that place?

423
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,080
What do you mean?

424
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,480
That's you being watchful.

425
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,040
I demais compared with you

426
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,000
is so sad.

427
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,200
Why?

428
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,680
What if she likes me?

429
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:29,800
That means

430
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,720
I can slightly

431
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,920
fix her anger.

432
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,280
I want one.

433
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,280
You're so down-to-earth.

434
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,160
You're not like yourself at all.

435
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,120
Li,

436
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,880
you have a brother?

437
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,600
Yes.

438
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,200
Do you know

439
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,600
what your brother likes

440
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,920
and what he doesn't like?

441
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:57,720
No.

442
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,640
He never told me.

443
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,920
You're so heartless.

444
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,360
Aren't you afraid that he'll be disappointed?

445
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,320
I'm so good.

446
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,600
What does my brother want?

447
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,120
I like myself very much.

448
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,600
I have a good personality

449
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,280
and I'm good-looking.

450
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,600
Many people love me.

451
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,280
I have someone I love.

452
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,280
I can eat and sleep.

453
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,840
And I eat more than others.

454
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,760
I'm really special.

455
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,920
What's wrong?

456
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,440
I just

457
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,080
love my sister very much.

458
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,800
She's so nice to me.

459
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,560
But I don't know

460
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,000
how to repay her.

461
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:48,960
Then

462
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,160
you're wrong.

463
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,440
My brothers and sisters

464
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,920
raised us so well.

465
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,240
They're so silly.

466
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,040
They're actually very happy.

467
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,360
We

468
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,000
put this gratitude in our hearts.

469
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,240
We just need to

470
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,480
live happily

471
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,800
and show them.

472
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,520
I didn't expect

473
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,440
you're quite reliable

474
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,800
sometimes.

475
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,280
Don't really treat me like a dog.

476
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,760
Call me Brother Qu Zhuo.

477
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,080
You're a dog.

478
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,480
Don't call me Brother Qu Zhuo.

479
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,400
What dog?

480
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,680
Hurry up.

481
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,640
Go.

482
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,560
Go, Li Gou.

483
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,560
You still say you're not a dog.

484
00:32:45,760 --> 00:33:04,500
The

485
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:12,700
arah

486
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:15,700
But it's just temporarily suppressed.

487
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,700
You fell asleep?

488
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,700
Lotus seed soup.

489
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,700
After drinking it, clean it up.

490
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,700
This year is the annual Wulan Festival of the Demon Valley.

491
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,700
I want to take you out and give you a gift.

492
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,700
Lotus seed soup.

493
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,700
Lotus seed soup.

494
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,700
Lotus seed soup.

495
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,700
Boss, this one is for me.

496
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,700
Rabbit.

497
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,700
Rabbit.

498
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,700
I want this.

499
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,700
Okay.

500
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,700
No need to find it.

501
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:04,700
Thank you.

502
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,700
I bought it for Qinglan.

503
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:08,700
I bought it for you.

504
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,700
It's very sweet. Try it.

505
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:14,700
Sister, I also want to buy a rabbit.

506
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,700
For you.

507
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:21,700
Thank you, sister.

508
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:23,700
Let's go.

509
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:33,700
What?

510
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:34,700
Your sister followed my brother out.

511
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:35,700
What are you worried about?

512
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,700
Because it's your brother, I'm even more worried.

513
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:42,700
You...

514
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:46,700
What do you think of this little brain?

515
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,700
I'm afraid my sister will be fooled by others.

516
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,700
Since you're so worried,

517
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,700
I'll let you know.

518
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:02,700
Let you know that my brother is the best man to be entrusted by your sister.

519
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,700
Don't say too much.

520
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:07,700
What if I hate your brother more after seeing it with my own eyes?

521
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:09,700
Let's see it for real.

522
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,700
Let's go.

523
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:28,700
Sir, please have some tea.

524
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,700
That dress is too suitable for a lady.

525
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,700
But the price is not cheap.

526
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:42,700
Thank you, sir.

527
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,700
Thank you.

528
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,700
If it were me, I would respect her decision.

529
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,700
Let her choose the one she likes.

530
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:53,700
Wait for me.

531
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,700
Thank you.

532
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,700
This is the gift I gave you.

533
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,700
A bowl of sweet porridge?

534
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,700
The world is on fire.

535
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,700
Ordinary couple, an ordinary day.

536
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,700
I'm sorry.

537
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,700
Huai Zhu,

538
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,700
I know you're young and weak.

539
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:51,700
What you want is an ordinary day like this.

540
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:55,700
I believe we will live such a day.

541
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,700
One day, it will be.

542
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,700
What are you doing?

543
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,700
Shut up.

544
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,700
Where are they going?

545
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:26,700
The Wulan Festival.

546
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,700
They made a wish under the Wulan tree near Banyue Lake.

547
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:33,700
It's said that as long as Banyue Lake becomes Yuan Yue Lake,

548
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,700
the wish will come true.

549
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:36,700
Do you want to go?

550
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:42,700
Will you have a stomachache at night?

551
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:44,700
No.

552
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,700
I have the spirit blood of the East.

553
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:36,700
I'm here.

554
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:37,700
I'm here.

555
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:38,700
I'm here.

556
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:39,700
I'm here.

557
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,700
I'm here.

558
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:41,700
I'm here.

559
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:42,700
I'm here.

560
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,700
I'm here.

561
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:44,700
I'm here.

562
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:45,700
I'm here.

563
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:46,700
