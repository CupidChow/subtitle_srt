1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,920
Freezemeal

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,160
Love and hate are both

3
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,040
Flowing

4
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,480
With tears as the wind

5
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,720
Chatting like a boat

6
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,920
Don't turn back and keep going

7
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,760
Life and death go forward

8
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,280
From the fire to the fire

9
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,480
Whose love

10
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,040
Is more vast than the universe

11
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,280
Don't turn back and keep going

12
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,120
Life and death go forward

13
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,560
From the fire to the fire

14
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,840
Whose love

15
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,520
Is more vast than the universe

16
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,520
It's me

17
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:04,120
Episode 16

18
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,120
Master.

19
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,880
Master, look.

20
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,520
For that flower,

21
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,560
we have died countless times in the tomb.

22
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,560
Then let's start the competition.

23
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,920
Find some new people outside.

24
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,440
No matter what,

25
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,960
I want to absorb the flower.

26
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,960
Yes, master.

27
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,480
I asked you to find the whereabouts of Wang Juan Hong Ye.

28
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,520
Why haven't we got any news yet?

29
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,480
The smoke has been released.

30
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,880
Master Xing is waiting for him.

31
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,200
But even if we find him,

32
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,320
with our ability,

33
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,720
we can't kill him.

34
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,320
Of course you can't kill him.

35
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,080
But there is one person who can.

36
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,080
Go find him.

37
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,520
Yes, master.

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
There is an assassin.

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Who is that?

40
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,520
Let's go.

41
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,520
Yes, master.

42
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,480
Let's go.

43
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,640
Boss Qing Mu.

44
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,120
Master Zhang.

45
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,720
Long time no see.

46
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,440
How are you?

47
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,720
Tell me.

48
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,600
Why are you here?

49
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,600
I should be the one asking this question.

50
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,560
You came to the Demon Kingdom three times in a month.

51
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,560
What are you going to do?

52
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,480
I have two legs.

53
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,920
Where should I go?

54
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,840
How does it concern you?

55
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,440
The Demon Kingdom is searching for Wang Juan Hong Ye.

56
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,720
Did you steal this news to the Demon Kingdom?

57
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,680
So Wang Juan Hong Ye is here too.

58
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,120
Why don't you ask him?

59
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,720
You should ask me instead.

60
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,600
Why do you always answer my questions?

61
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,680
Is it because you and the Demon Kingdom

62
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,680
have been in a long relationship?

63
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,480
What?

64
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,880
Did I get it right?

65
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,480
Do you want to kill me?

66
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,840
Let go.

67
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,160
I have to ask you something.

68
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,640
Why are you so different after you turn 18

69
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,920
and you don't want to see me?

70
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,520
What happened in the middle?

71
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,200
Say something.

72
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,600
Say something.

73
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,400
Now I can confirm that

74
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,000
the demons that the Demon Kingdom bought

75
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
were sent to get the West Lake Flower.

76
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And they have no regrets.

77
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,000
This is the purpose of the Demon Slayer Competition.

78
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,800
And the assassin who assassinated you

79
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,200
was also ordered by the Demon Kingdom.

80
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,080
Big Brother, Big Sister-in-law.

81
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,520
When you went to the Demon Kingdom,

82
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,720
Ruyi Pavilion got news

83
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,720
that the Demon Kingdom's Demon Kingdom's owner was found.

84
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,400
The new State Preceptor of the Demon Kingdom,

85
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,480
An Nayan.

86
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,800
State Preceptor An Nayan.

87
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,600
He is going to West Lake Flower.

88
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,600
And he ordered the assassin to assassinate me.

89
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,000
He also ordered the assassin to assassinate you.

90
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,600
Big Brother,

91
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,400
let's go to State Preceptor's Mansion to meet him.

92
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,800
It's easy to alert the snake.

93
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,800
They sent a lot of swallows.

94
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,000
They are looking for you in the city.

95
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,000
We can get the assassin out first.

96
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,600
It makes sense.

97
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,200
How?

98
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,600
The opposite of the swallows.

99
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,800
What are you doing?

100
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,200
Why are you following me?

101
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,800
I'm not afraid of wolves

102
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,600
or demons.

103
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,800
I just fear the darkness.

104
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,400
to repair the fire.

105
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,920
What's wrong?

106
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,800
My leg seems to be injured.

107
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,000
What are you doing?

108
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,040
Before I kill you,

109
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,760
I want to know the whole truth.

110
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,560
Who are you?

111
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,240
Zhang Zhen.

112
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,280
I want to know your true name.

113
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,280
Speaks.

114
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,640
꾸 Gro Thomas?

115
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,200
So,

116
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,680
was the sounds of Zhang Guo

117
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,280
Did you really sell your body

118
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,360
to Young Master

119
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,800
because you and him

120
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,320
look exactly the same?

121
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,560
Yes.

122
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,480
You took his identity away

123
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,280
and deceived everyone in the Zhang family.

124
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,480
Yes.

125
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:45,960
Where is Zhang Zheng?

126
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,760
Where is he?

127
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,040
He's dead.

128
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,640
He's dead.

129
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,840
You killed him.

130
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,240
I killed him.

131
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,400
He's such a good man.

132
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,920
You killed him.

133
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,280
I'm going to kill you.

134
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,680
Kill me.

135
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,240
I'm tired.

136
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,640
I'm sorry.

137
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,680
I'm sorry.

138
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,080
I can't go with you.

139
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,640
Miss Qingli,

140
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,320
I'm here to save you.

141
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,760
It's you.

142
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,600
You took me out of the Nightfall.

143
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,640
I want to hear the story between you and Zhang Zheng.

144
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,800
What happened

145
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,320
between you two?

146
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,120
We, young masters,

147
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,360
were

148
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,520
a great city.

149
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,720
Take to the left a bit.

150
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,520
Yes, that place.

151
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,840
I heard Yuan was asleep

152
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,600
in his bed late this morning

153
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,640
and was fired.

154
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,280
But rest assured

155
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,960
I helped him get his repair.

156
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,200
He doesn't like to move.

157
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,200
He has a good appetite.

158
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,000
He ate four moon cakes today.

159
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,640
He ate four?

160
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,080
Young Master knows him.

161
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,200
Shan Zhen doesn't like it.

162
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,560
He likes to eat five-person moon cakes.

163
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,480
Why didn't you come back with him?

164
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,240
He's afraid of the dark.

165
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,280
I've sent him back

166
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,280
after I finished the punishment at the Academy.

167
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,200
Come on.

168
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,800
That's good.

169
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,600
A'Yun has grown up.

170
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,560
Miss Qingmu

171
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,440
will soon be the new head of Ruyi Restaurant.

172
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,200
Young Master will

173
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,480
spend the Mid-Autumn Festival with her next year.

174
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,760
Me?

175
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,160
This year won't be easy.

176
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,200
Thank you for

177
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,400
taking the medicine for me

178
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,400
and giving me a good health.

179
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,680
And for me,

180
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,560
go to see A'Yun.

181
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,160
If I die,

182
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,960
you will be erased.

183
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I can run.

184
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,960
I've seen you practice swordsmanship.

185
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,200
You're talented.

186
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,680
If you want to run,

187
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,120
you can run.

188
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,400
Why don't you run?

189
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,520
Why?

190
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,200
You talk a little deste数.

191
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,440
But you're very tenderhearted.

192
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,680
You left me for me.

193
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,240
That's why

194
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,720
I...

195
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,360
I have something to do for you.

196
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,560
There's a bottle of heart medicine in the drawer.

197
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,680
Go get it.

198
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,840
Pour it all out.

199
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:52,960
Go to sleep.

200
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,280
Are you tired?

201
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,280
Please have a rest,습니다

202
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,920
There's a moon cake on the desk.

203
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,760
If you want to shake it up,

204
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,400
I know you don't love evangelical church young.

205
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:39,320
I didn't kill him

206
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,040
Young Master.

207
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,280
Young Master.

208
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,840
Did the medicine start to work?

209
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,080
Young Master, you can get out of bed.

210
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,120
That's great.

211
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,280
I asked someone to buy the medicine for Mid-Autumn Festival.

212
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,160
It's called jade-like.

213
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,000
It can make me return to light immediately.

214
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,680
I can walk around in the street.

215
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,400
But it will speed up my death.

216
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,480
Why did you do that?

217
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,840
Because I think you

218
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,880
are more suitable for black swordsmanship than me.

219
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,840
I've been a lawyer since I was a child.

220
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,680
I want to be a swordsman

221
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,240
and make black swords more powerful.

222
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,200
I was once the strongest swordsman of the Yiqi Sect.

223
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,720
Young Master, stop.

224
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,560
My sword.

225
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,600
How's mine?

226
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,080
Very good.

227
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,120
That's fine.

228
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:30,920
From today,

229
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,480
I'll be you.

230
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,240
Yi Zi's hand will be yours.

231
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,960
The surrounding will always be yours.

232
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,000
Ah.

233
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,480
Stay in this room.

234
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,520
I have about ten days

235
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,920
to get up.

236
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,880
You have to get up from the bed

237
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,720
and go through the miracle step by step.

238
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,600
Young Master.

239
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,840
Let's change clothes.

240
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,640
Young Master.

241
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,960
I've taken the jade-like pill.

242
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,280
I can't turn back.

243
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,040
It's okay.

244
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,960
I have many strong wills and unhappiness.

245
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,760
I have many heart-wrenching regrets.

246
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,080
But at least

247
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,680
I didn't hate you

248
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,800
and die on the bed.

249
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,400
At least

250
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,200
your life

251
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,880
can go on.

252
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,400
The end.

253
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,040
So

254
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,560
he wanted to exchange his identity with you.

255
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,880
Then why did you say that you killed him?

256
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,840
He died because of me.

257
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,000
I killed him.

258
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:54,660
Are you the hero of the

259
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,560
historicalliterature?

260
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,920
Who are you?

261
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,520
I'm a police officer.

262
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:04,960
A soldier.

263
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:09,880
A soldier?

264
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,640
Young Master, this is the order from the master.

265
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,240
You can't make things difficult for us.

266
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,360
I'll talk to him.

267
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,320
This...

268
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,160
Young Master.

269
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,000
Get lost!

270
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Yes.

271
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,960
I'm sorry.

272
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,960
I didn't get to wait for your friend.

273
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,280
This is how it's going to end.

274
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,280
Don't be afraid, Sister.

275
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,280
You can ask for more.

276
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,080
This is the result I wanted.

277
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,880
I'm already a demon of violence.

278
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,880
You know that.

279
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,880
You can't.

280
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,880
Do you know how much pain I've been going through

281
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:36,060
after I took the jade

282
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,060
and buried it?

283
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,060
It's painful.

284
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,060
You really can't.

285
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:50,060
You died of a stroke.

286
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,060
It's a hundred times more painful than this.

287
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,060
Why didn't you give me a choice

288
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:58,060
and give me a chance to stop you?

289
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,060
Because I was disappointed.

290
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:05,060
This is all my own choice.

291
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,060
It has nothing to do with you.

292
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,060
Don't feel guilty.

293
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:17,060
I hope you can live well.

294
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:19,060
Go on.

295
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:34,060
This is the handle I've been carrying around since I was a child.

296
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:37,060
I'm always hesitating.

297
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:40,060
I almost lost it

298
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:44,060
when I was trying to give you something.

299
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,060
Jun Zilan.

300
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:53,060
I didn't do it well.

301
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,060
From today on,

302
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,060
you are Black Sword Zhang Zheng.

303
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,060
Take care of my Lan Wang.

304
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,060
Take care of yourself.

305
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:29,060
Take care of the Zhang family.

306
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,060
Let go.

307
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:45,060
You want me to work hard for nothing, right?

308
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,060
No.

309
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:58,060
If you have to feel guilty about something,

310
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:02,060
you are doing well.

311
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:06,060
That's the only thing I can think of.

312
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,060
Help me put the knife on my head.

313
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,060
They are just following orders.

314
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,060
If they see my face,

315
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,060
I will...

316
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:19,060
I'm sorry.

317
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,060
It's time to say goodbye.

318
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:40,060
I hope Black Sword Zhang Zheng

319
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:44,060
is a decisive person.

320
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,060
Are you the one who took care of Qingmu Garden

321
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:12,060
because of Young Master?

322
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:15,060
Yes.

323
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:21,060
I'm sorry.

324
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,060
I'm sorry.

325
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,060
I'm sorry.

326
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:30,060
I'm sorry.

327
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:33,060
I'm sorry.

328
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:36,060
I'm sorry.

329
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,060
Then why did you

330
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,060
ignore Qingmu Garden

331
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:47,060
after you became Zhang Zheng?

332
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:55,060
It's because Young Master likes Qingmu Garden.

333
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:58,060
You dare not to make a wish.

334
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:02,060
Yes.

335
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,060
Do you like Qingmu Garden?

336
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,060
Yes.

337
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:14,060
Zhang Zheng, what's wrong with you?

338
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:17,060
Zhang Zheng.

339
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:20,060
Why is your face so hot?

340
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:22,060
Chen Mingyi and his formation

341
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:24,060
won't hurt anyone.

342
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,060
Zhang Zheng.

343
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,060
I'm sorry.

344
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,060
I'm sorry.

345
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:03,060
Luckily, I brought the money and the belt.

346
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,060
I've finally healed your wound.

347
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,060
What's wrong with you?

348
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:14,060
What do you like?

349
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,060
I like Qingmu Garden.

350
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,060
Your reaction speed

351
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:25,060
is still the same as when you were a child.

352
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:35,060
Then let me ask you a question.

353
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:39,060
Can Zhang Zheng

354
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:41,060
be with Qingmu Garden forever?

355
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:44,060
No.

356
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,060
Why not?

357
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:48,060
Let me ask you again.

358
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,060
Answer me.

359
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:52,060
Can Zhang Zheng

360
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:54,060
be with Qingmu Garden forever?

361
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,060
No.

362
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:59,060
Why?

363
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:09,060
You're in a dream now.

364
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:13,060
In a dream,

365
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,060
do you dare to ask about Qingmu Garden?

366
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:40,060
I'm sorry.

367
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:09,060
Qingmu Garden.

368
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:39,060
The person who loves you

369
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:41,060
hopes that you can live for yourself.

370
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:10,060
I'll use my thousands of words

371
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:12,060
to say goodbye.

372
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:16,060
I'll exchange our life for a wish.

373
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:19,060
Even if I can't keep the past

374
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:21,060
in my heart,

375
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:24,060
I'll keep the dream in my heart.

376
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:28,060
If we meet again in the next life...

377
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:40,060
Miss, it's early.

378
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,060
Miss,

379
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:47,060
why are you up so early today?

380
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,060
Miss,

381
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:59,060
have you met Zhang Zheng?

382
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,060
Yes.

383
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:05,060
It's really early.

384
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:09,060
I know he's not convinced.

385
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,060
Miss,

386
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:14,060
why do you look so worried?

387
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:18,060
Because I finally understand

388
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:20,060
why Zhang Zheng

389
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,060
will become like this after 18 years.

390
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:25,060
Why he will stop all desires

391
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:27,060
and live like a miserable monk.

392
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,060
Why he will not rest and sleep

393
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:33,060
and only spend five years

394
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:35,060
to become the second one in the world.

395
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:41,060
Why he will never see me again.

396
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,060
Why?

397
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,060
Because someone

398
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:49,060
sacrificed everything for him,

399
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:52,060
but instead became his lock.

400
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:56,060
He feels that he can't enjoy,

401
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,060
can't stop walking,

402
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,060
and can't fail.

403
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,060
That person's expectation...

404
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:08,060
But the most regrettable thing is

405
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:10,060
that someone

406
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,060
threatened him with this secret

407
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,060
and forced him to do

408
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:15,060
what he didn't want to do.

409
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:23,060
You killed me.

410
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:29,060
I'm tired.

411
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,060
Miss,

412
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:36,060
Master Zhang wants to see you.

413
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:39,060
He finally comes to see me.

414
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,060
Master Zhang,

415
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,060
you're a rare guest.

416
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:01,060
Your handwriting is good.

417
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,060
You're really me.

418
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:04,060
What did you do to me last night?

419
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,060
What are you talking about?

420
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:09,060
You fainted suddenly last night.

421
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:11,060
I gave you the medicine.

422
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,060
That's all?

423
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,060
Of course.

424
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,060
Why can't I remember

425
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,060
everything clearly

426
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,060
after I woke up?

427
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:22,060
That was the private banquet of Ling.

428
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,060
You don't remember

429
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:25,060
what happened after the private banquet.

430
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,060
Boss Qingmu.

431
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:30,060
You had such a high fever last night.

432
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,060
It's normal

433
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,060
to forget something.

434
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,060
What do you mean?

435
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,060
How long have we known each other

436
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,060
since we were in the same bed?

437
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:57,060
Why do you say such a meaningless thing?

438
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,060
We were in the same bed

439
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:00,060
for a long time.

440
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:02,060
Although you were silent,

441
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:05,060
at least you're alive.

442
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:08,060
What happened

443
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:10,060
that made you give up all your desires

444
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:13,060
and become a monk?

445
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,060
Why?

446
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,060
The one who loves you

447
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:30,060
wants you to live for yourself.

448
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,060
That's what it means.

449
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,060
Qingmu Yuan.

450
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,060
You're playing with me, aren't you?

451
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,060
Don't call me Boss Qingmu.

452
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,060
I'm not playing with you.

453
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:54,060
The red window is also a kind of love.

454
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,060
I hope

455
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,060
you can live for yourself.

456
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,060
Goodbye.

457
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,060
Zhang Zheng.

458
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,060
I'm sorry.

459
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:24,060
Not only did you agree,

460
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,060
but I also opened your wound.

461
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,060
I'll keep this secret

462
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,060
until you're cured

463
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,060
of all your obstacles.

464
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:42,060
The news from the King of Bumu

465
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,060
to the eldest brother.

466
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,060
The Tangshui Shop below

467
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,060
is the stronghold of the State Preceptor.

468
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,060
Which one do you think is the swallow?

469
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:51,060
Is it the beautiful boss's mother

470
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:54,060
or the one who drank the water

471
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,060
and didn't move even after drinking 80,000 Tangshui?

472
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,060
Brother Li.

473
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,060
When you call me sister,

474
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,060
I'll tell you who the swallow is.

475
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,060
You?

476
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,060
You're so annoying.

477
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:10,060
I've been picking medicine and treating diseases with my sister since I was a kid.

478
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,060
I've never seen a third-class wine cellar.

479
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:14,060
No one can escape my eyes.

480
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:17,060
Come on. Call me sister and listen to me.

481
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,060
I'll analyze it for you.

482
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,060
Come in.

483
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,060
Please.

484
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,060
Please.

485
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,060
Please.

486
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,060
Please.

487
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,060
Look.

488
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:36,060
The man who drank 80,000 Tangshui

489
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:39,060
has been staring at the beautiful boss's mother.

490
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,060
He should be a flowery-winged man.

491
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,060
The boss's mother

492
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,060
is very beautiful.

493
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:48,060
She runs a small Tangshui Shop.

494
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,060
She's really good.

495
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,060
But did you notice that

496
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,060
she never stood up?

497
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,060
There's something wrong with her left leg.

498
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,060
She's disabled.

499
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,060
It's impossible for her to stand up.

500
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:03,060
The most suspicious thing about the whole shop

501
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,060
is actually those two firemen.

502
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:09,060
One of them is still in Moyang Palace.

503
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,060
It's such a small shop.

504
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,060
Even if he's busy every day,

505
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:14,060
can he afford to hire two firemen?

506
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,060
Maybe

507
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,060
he's the boss's mother's ghost.

508
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:21,060
Which ghost dares to come here?

509
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,060
Let's go, Li Geng.

510
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,060
Let's go down and meet him.

511
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,060
The wind blows like a dew,

512
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,060
like a flower,

513
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:01,060
you are in a daze,

514
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:04,060
not far away.

515
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:08,060
My heart is not beating,

516
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:10,060
my heart is not beating.

517
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:14,060
I love you so much that I forget to return.

518
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:18,060
I wander around like a wild geese,

519
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,060
my old life is a mess.

520
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:21,060
I'm still alone,

521
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,060
I'm still alone,

522
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,060
I'm still alone,

523
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,060
I'm still alone,

524
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,060
I'm still alone,

525
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,060
I'm still alone,

526
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,060
I'm still alone,

527
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,060
I'm still alone,

528
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,060
I'm still alone,

529
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,060
I'm still alone,

530
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,060
I'm still alone,

531
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,060
I'm still alone,

532
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:34,060
I'm still alone,

533
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,060
I'm still alone,

534
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,060
I'm still alone,

535
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,060
I'm still alone,

536
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,060
I'm still alone,

537
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,060
I'm still alone,

538
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,060
I'm still alone,

539
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,060
I'm still alone,

540
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,060
I'm still alone,

541
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,060
I'm still alone,

542
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,060
I'm still alone,

543
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,060
I'm still alone,

544
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,060
I'm still alone,

545
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,060
I'm still alone,

546
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,060
I'm still alone,

547
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,060
I'm still alone,

548
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,060
I'm still alone,

549
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:51,060
I'm still alone,

550
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,060
I'm still alone,

551
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,060
I'm still alone,

552
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,060
I'm still alone,

553
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:55,060
I'm still alone,

554
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,060
I'm still alone,

555
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,060
I'm still alone,

556
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,060
I'm still alone,

557
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,060
I'm still alone,

558
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,060
I'm still alone,

559
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,060
I'm still alone,

560
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:02,060
I'm still alone,

561
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,060
I'm still alone,

562
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,060
I'm still alone,

563
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:05,060
I'm still alone,

564
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,060
I'm still alone,

565
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,060
I'm still alone,

566
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:08,060
I'm still alone,

567
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,060
I'm still alone,

00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:11,060
I'm still alone,

00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,060
I'm still alone,
