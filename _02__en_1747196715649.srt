Hello everyone, I am the host of Happy Family, Xiao Ming

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yesterday, when I saw my son from kindergarten

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
bringing back a portrait, I asked him

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
who did this portrait belong to?

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
My son proudly told me

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,480
He told me that this is my most beautiful mother

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,480
I look left and right

12
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,480
Look up and down

13
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,480
I still didn't see where it was like me

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,680
I was joking with him

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,440
So ugly

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,440
Not like mom at all

17
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,440
My son explained seriously

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,440
I will put on makeup for him in a while

19
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,440
Son

20
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,440
Then you have to draw well

21
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,440
Oh my god

22
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,960
Report to headquarters

23
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,960

24
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,960
Where is the rescue staff?

25
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,960

26
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,960
Don't interfere with my work

27
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,960
Look at me

28
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,960
I didn't look at you

29
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,960
Look at me

30
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,960
You are my big brother

31
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,960
I have no eyes

32
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,960
Oh my god

33
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,960
You are good

34
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,960
I am the bomb expert Xiong Ziqi

35
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,960
Now I come to rescue you

36
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,960
I can't calm down

37
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,960
I was scared the first time I saw the bomb

38
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,960
It's okay

39
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,960
Don't worry, I will save you

40
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,960
I am a bomb expert

41
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,960
I have a natural advantage

42
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,960
Natural advantage?

43
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,960
I can't kill you

44
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,960
I have a compulsive disorder

45
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,960
Compulsive disorder?

46
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,960
I have night blindness

47
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,960
Is your bomb related?

48
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,960
Because I have compulsive disorder

49
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,960
I am not allowed to make any mistakes

50
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,960
So in my task

51
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,960
I have never failed

52
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,960
Let me see your bomb

53
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,960
Hold it

55
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,960
Don't worry, I will take it off in a while

56
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,960
Oh my god

57
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,960
Your bomb

58
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,960
It's too disgusting

59
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,960
You are a bomb expert

60
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,960
Apologize to me

61
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,960

00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,960
Blame others

70
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,960

You are not in the right position

77

00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,540
Where's the money?

199
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,540
Take it

200
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,540
Is it good?

201
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,540
Is it good?

202
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,540
Look at the bottom

203
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,540
Is it black?

204
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,540
What's wrong?

205
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,540
Is it big?

206
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,540
No, 42

207
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,540
I'm really good

208
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,540
I'm really good

209
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,540
Get up

210
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,540
Oh my god

211
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,540
Back, back

212
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,540
Back

213
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,540
I'm so nervous

214
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,540
Oh my god, I'm finally done

215
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,540
Great

216
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,540
I'm really nervous

217
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,540
I'm 1 minute and 01 seconds

218
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,540
I'm 1 minute and 01 seconds

219
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,540
1 second

220
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,540
You want to kill me

221
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,540
How can you sit for 1 second?

222
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,540
Don't move

223
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,540
Stand up

224
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,540
I'll help you

225
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,540
Come on

226
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,540
No, no, no

227
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,540
No, I'll walk for 1 more second

228
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,540
You're not a compulsive disorder

229
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,540
You're sick

230
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,540
1 second

231
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,540
Hello, everyone

232
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,540
I'm Song Er Leng, who's screaming in the loudspeaker

233
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,540
Do you know me?

234
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,540
Yes

235
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,540
I'm the famous performance artist of our village

236
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,540
Because as soon as the leaders come to our village

237
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,540
Our village director

238
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,540
Let me play various roles

239
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,540
Act for the leaders

240
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,540
Mainly bragging

241
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,540
Just call me like this

242
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,540
There must be someone up there

243
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,540
You guys say, can I help him

244
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,540
to fool the leaders today?

245
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,540
Yes

246
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,540
Who else can do that?

247
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,540
You come up

248
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,540
Such a good-looking girl

249
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,540
What work do you dare to do

250
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,540
Song Er Leng

251
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,540
Director, are you going to turn the sky upside down?

252
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,540
Why are you here?

253
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,540
The inspection team will be here soon

254
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,540
The old rules, rush up at the critical time

255
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,540
Block the leaders and give me a strong blow

256
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,540
OK, the old rules

257
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,540
Give me your lines today

258
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,540
I forgot such an important thing

259
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,540
Then it's over

260
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,540
You didn't give me the lines, how can I blow the smoke?

261
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,540
Don't worry

262
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,540
You just say I've done those good things

263
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,540
Have you done good things?

264
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,540
Do I have to blow you?

265
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,540
Director

266
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,540
Can you change the person?

267
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,540
There are so many people in our village

268
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,540
You can't let me suffer alone

269
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,540
I can't bear to see your face

270
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,540
Look at this face

271
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,540
How deceitful

272
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,540
The hat is thick and the face is pure

273
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,540
What the director means is

274
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,540
I won't lie to you easily

275
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,540
I'll lie to you one by one

276
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,540
You bastard

277
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,540
Director, look at the villages around us

278
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,540
The village director has brought everyone

279
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,540
to live a good life

280
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,540
The village director took everyone to build dams

281
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,540
Now they are green ecological park

282
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,540
And the yellow rice village

283
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,540
It used to be a famous poor village

284
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,540
Now they are building food processing plants

285
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,540
They have already been out of poverty

286
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,540
Look at those village directors

287
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,540
They are tired

288
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,540
They can't even stand up

289
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,540
Look at my waist

290
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,540
Where is your waist?

291
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,540
Where do you care about my waist?

292
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,540
My waist is still strong

293
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,540
This big waist

294
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,540
The super high pay rate, the reward rate

295
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,540
The chance to get rich, more and more

296
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,540
Hurry up and join

297
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,540
Macau New Peking Entertainment City 015005.com

298
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,540
I'm not a good actor

299
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,540
The new son-in-law of Liu

300
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,540
From the county troupe

301
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,540
Can the county troupe do this for you?

302
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,540
If he doesn't do it

303
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,540
I won't give him the old man to play the low treasure

304
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,540
Low treasure is a policy set by the state

305
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,540
You say you don't give it

306
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,540
What's wrong? I'm the owner of my land

307
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,540
What is that?

308
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,540
donkey

309
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,540
I want to say he is a horse

310
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,540
I see who dares to say he is a donkey

311
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,540
Do you dare?

312
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,540
I dare not

313
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,540
You say he is you, we have no opinion

314
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,540
Master, the meeting is over

315
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,540
Wait a minute

316
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,540
The son-in-law of Liu has come here

317
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,540
I don't know him

318
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,540
I haven't seen him

319
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,540
I haven't seen him either

320
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,540
He hasn't done this job

321
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,540
You tell him

322
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,540
When the inspection team arrives, you two will go up

323
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,540
Give me a few high-level players

324
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,540
High-level players

325
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,540
Look at this shape

326
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,540
Look at this shape

327
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,540
It's like a ball

328
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,540
Where can I get you a high-level player?

329
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,540
Yes, I am a high-level player

330
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,540
Leader

331
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,540
This time the other villages are very good

332
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,540
Only the village of director

333
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,540
The people's opinion is very big

334
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,540
Yes, I just want to see how they act

335
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,540
Come on

336
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,540
Son-in-law of Liu

337
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,540
Help the village director act

338
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,540
Act?

339
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,540
The leader is here to help the director act

340
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,540
Come on

341
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,540
What are you doing?

342
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,540
The county group

343
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,540
Good conditions

344
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,540
The five officials look very good

345
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,540
I tell you

346
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,540
When the leader comes, you should be more energetic

347
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,540
Don't be so crazy

348
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,540
No, I'm serious

349
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,540
Yes

350
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,540
No, I'm serious

351
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,540
My god

352
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,540
These people are so selfish

353
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,540
He can see others, but others can't

354
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,540
What do you mean?

355
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,540
Nothing

356
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,540
You are serious

357
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,540
What is it?

358
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,540
You are so serious

359
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,540
Son-in-law

360
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,540
Come on

361
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:02,540
What are you counting?

362
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,540
I'm counting pigs.

363
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,540
It's the 60th of the Chinese New Year.

364
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:09,540
36 pigs.

365
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,540
Oh my god, who can tell?

366
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,540
This face is 5,000 years old.

367
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,540
It's so ugly.

368
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,540
What's wrong with you?

369
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,540
Oh my god.

370
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,540
Actually, I understand why you came.

371
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:28,540
You're doing this for your father-in-law's treasure.

372
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,540
I'm doing this for our house's renovation fund.

373
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,540
Otherwise, who can do this?

374
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:35,540
What do we do?

375
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,540
The director said that when the leaders come,

376
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,540
we'll rush up and give him a good blow.

377
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,540
Give him a blow?

378
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,540
What good things did he do?

379
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,540
He did good things.

380
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,540
He didn't even do human things.

381
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,540
Oh, my god.

382
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,540
Isn't that talking nonsense with your eyes open?

383
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,540
Oh my god.

384
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,540
Oh my god.

385
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,540
Actors, the actors,

386
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,540
the actors in the drama team,

387
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,540
the actors in the drama team,

388
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,540
they're all the same.

389
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,540
You really can open your eyes?

390
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,540
Oh my god.

391
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,540
You'll hear it later.

392
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,540
Your father-in-law will come down with the treasure.

393
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,540
Oh, right.

394
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,540
You won't act and give him the treasure, right?

395
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,540
The director won't say that.

396
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,540
The director will make you wait.

397
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,540
When will I wait?

398
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,540
When the treasure comes down,

399
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,540
your father-in-law will come down with the treasure.

400
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,540
He'll come down and say,

401
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,540
I'm so happy.

402
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,540
What do you mean?

403
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,540
I'm so happy.

404
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,540
I'm telling you,

405
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,540
when the leader comes,

406
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,540
you have to blow it hard.

407
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,540
No, I can't blow it without understanding the situation.

408
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,540
I'm afraid it'll explode.

409
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,540
Don't blow it.

410
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,540
If you change my method again,

411
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,540
I'll be in trouble.

412
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,540
Come on.

413
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,540
Read this letter.

414
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,540
I read this letter last time.

415
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,540
Anyway, it's not from the same group of leaders.

416
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,540
You wrote it?

417
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,540
I wrote it.

418
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,540
The owner spent money on the old man's letter.

419
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,540
Do I have to memorize it?

420
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,540
You can't memorize it.

421
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,540
I've read this word for half a year.

422
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,540
I can't memorize it.

423
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,540
Why?

424
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,540
It's not a word for human beings.

425
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,540
It's not a word for human beings.

426
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,540
It's not easy to memorize.

427
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,540
I really want to see

428
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,540
what it is if it's not a word for human beings.

429
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,540
A miracle in the small village.

430
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,540
It's a rush.

431
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,540
You can't read it like that.

432
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,540
The director wants a high-level work.

433
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,540
You have to use your strength.

434
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,540
Use my strength?

435
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,540
Think about your old father-in-law.

436
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,540
The treasure is more valuable.

437
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:16,540
A miracle in the small village.

438
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,540
Rush out of Asia.

439
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,540
Run international.

440
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,540
Now try it.

441
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,540
One world conference.

442
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,540
Running out of bullets.

443
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,540
The tiniest yell.

444
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,540
Let's hope you won't talk about winning.

445
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,540
Like onи thetearhead.

446
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,540
I want to give my best.

447
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,540
Always remember that your life turns one end to the other.

448
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,540
Alright, I'm done.

449
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,540
You guys are acting like this?

450
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,540
This is too easy.

451
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,540
Oh my god, you're not even looking at the people in the county.

452
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,540
You're acting like this is easy.

453
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,540
You're acting like a man, try it.

454
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,540
Is there a man?

455
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,540
Of course.

456
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:04,540
Last time when the leader came, the director asked me to act like a poor man.

457
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,540
A man acting.

458
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,540
You've acted like this before?

459
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,540
Then you act for us.

460
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,540
Don't make a scene.

461
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,540
Act.

462
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,540
The crowd's cheering.

463
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,540
If you don't act, I won't act for a while.

464
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,540
You...

465
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,540
Put this song down.

466
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,540
There's music?

467
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,540
Of course.

468
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:25,540
When the leader came, the director arranged for a big party.

469
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,540
He put this song down to make the atmosphere better.

470
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,540
The director gave me this song. I usually practice with it.

471
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,540
Start.

472
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,540
You're acting.

473
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:51,540
Sprinkle a fewamenas of sadism to them.

474
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,540
Give a lot of spotlight to the eyes.

475
00:17:53,540 --> 00:18:14,940
Now, it's

476
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:21,940
He... he... he... he... he is the village director

477
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:27,940
Director... he... he... he...

478
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:34,940
Oh, young man, you really cry

479
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:39,940
I can't cry, last time it was raining and the director punished me 500 yuan

480
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,940
500?

481
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:45,940
Why did you choose him when he is so good?

482
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,940
Oh my god, this is a good question

483
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,940
I tell you, when we choose the village director, he has a trick

484
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:56,940
You see, when we choose the director, everyone can vote for two candidates

485
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:06,940
The director said, the first vote is for yourself, the second vote is for me, the last vote is for the village man and woman

486
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:11,940
Everyone has one vote, only our director has the most votes, he chose

487
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:15,940
He chose

488
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:18,940
So, is there anyone you are afraid of?

489
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:22,940
Afraid of the people above, last time a leader came and said one sentence

490
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:26,940
What's the situation? He was scared and he was at home for several days

491
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:30,940
Oh, what if I came from above?

492
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,940
You came from above, go up

493
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,940
Hey, Sun Ermei, you can go back now

494
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:38,940
No, I'm not acting

495
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,940
What acting? It's already this time, the inspection team will not come

496
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,940
You changed my room into a flat

497
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,940
You didn't act, why should I?

498
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,940
If you didn't act, why didn't you come to me?

499
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,940
Why should I come? Didn't the inspection team come?

500
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,940
Why didn't the inspection team come?

501
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,940
Are you afraid of the inspection team coming?

502
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:57,940
If you have the ability, find the inspection team, I'll give you a flat right now

503
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,940
How do you know I can't find it?

504
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:00,940
What do you mean?

505
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,940
What do you mean? The inspection team is here

506
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:04,940
Where?

507
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,940
He is from the inspection team

508
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:09,940
Stand up

509
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:15,940
The crew is all relying on you, help me

510
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:17,940
You are?

511
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,940
I'm Gao, I'm from the inspection team

512
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,940
Gao Chao is here

513
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:28,940
You're not talking nonsense, are you?

514
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:29,940
No

515
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:31,940
Acting

516
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,940
Acting

517
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:36,940
Acting?

518
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:41,940
He didn't give me the reform money, can I act?

519
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:45,940
He is the reform money, what's the situation?

520
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:50,940
The situation is that it has been approved

521
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:53,940
Take it

522
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,940
Can the old Liu Zong's treasure be approved?

523
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,940
What's the situation with the treasure?

524
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:05,940
It has been approved, take it

525
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,940
Then you'll have to pay me 500 yuan

526
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,940
What's the situation?

527
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,940
He is a little hesitant, right?

528
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:20,940
Give it back, I'm here, take it

529
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:22,940
I don't want to fight

530
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:23,940
You're here

531
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,940
Leader, you saw it, right?

532
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,940
The interest in the crowd is not small

533
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:33,940
I'm doing my best for the blind

534
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:36,940
Although I'm sick, my waist is not good

535
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:37,940
What's the situation with his waist?

536
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:38,940
Fat waist

537
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:41,940
Leader, I'll answer the phone

538
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,940
I didn't expect you to be so good

539
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,940
It's a pity you're just a trap

540
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,940
If you really are from the inspection team

541
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:52,940
You should hide

542
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,940
Yes, yes, yes, Chief Gao has arrived

543
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,940
Please call him

544
00:21:58,940 --> 00:21:59,940
Okay

545
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:06,940
You should hide, Chief Gao

546
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,940
You're here

547
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,940
Okay, see you at the village committee

548
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:13,940
See you at the village committee

549
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:21,940
What's the situation?

550
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,940
You're really Chief Gao

551
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,940
Your eyes are not small

552
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:34,940
My eyes are too small, they look too selfish

553
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:35,940
Leader, this guy can't talk

554
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,940
He's telling the truth

555
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,940
You're acting with us every day

556
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,940
Why do other villages live a good life?

557
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,940
Because all the village leaders

558
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,940
Are thinking about doing good deeds for the people every day

559
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,940
You're thinking about how to fool the leaders

560
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,940
Can the people live a good life?

561
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:53,940
Leader

562
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:58,940
Your situation is under control

563
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,940
I want to talk to you later

564
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,940
Talk to me? What do you mean?

565
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,940
You want to talk?

566
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,940
Let's talk later

567
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,940
I want to talk too

568
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:12,940
Do you dare to use your words to describe yourself?

569
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:13,940
I dare

570
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,940
I dare to sign my name

571
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,940
The party and the government will vote for us

572
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,940
The people will not fear anything

573
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,940
Leader

574
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:26,940
I admit that I have many shortcomings and shortcomings in my work

575
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,940
But I never forget that I was born with hardships

576
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,940
I'm the son of a farmer

577
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:34,940
You know you're the son of a farmer

578
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,940
When you didn't give the people a land

579
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,940
Why didn't you think of the farmers as your father?

580
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,940
When you blocked the people's illegal reform

581
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,940
Why didn't you think of the people as your father?

582
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,940
When you were in the village

583
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:48,940
How could you not think of the farmers as your father?

584
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:49,940
Well said

585
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,940
What's wrong, brother-in-law?

586
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,940
Look at your appearance

587
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,940
You're a girl's little firewood

588
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,940
I'm a girl's little mushroom

589
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,940
I changed your tongue's shoelaces

590
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,940
What are you doing here?

591
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:12,940
This is a girl's rebellion

592
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,940
No, this is a firewood rebellion

593
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,940
You're messing with me

594
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,940
What are you doing?

595
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,940
Why are you late for work today?

596
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,940
Blocked the car

597
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,940
There is only one road in our village

598
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,940
I can't see people for eight lifetimes

599
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,940
Who blocked you?

600
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,940
You're a girl's little firewood

601
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:39,940
I'm late for work

602
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,940
Then you should say you're late for work

603
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,940
I'm not afraid you'll beat me

604
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,940
I'm more ruthless

605
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,940
Then I'll know now

606
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,940
Meeting

607
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,940
What meeting?

608
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:56,940
The 48th National University of the Communist Party of China

609
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,940
All the teachers' meetings

610
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,940
Brother-in-law

611
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:03,940
Is it necessary to have a meeting like this?

612
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,940
Although the scale is small, it must be formal

613
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,940
We have a sense of ceremony

614
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:08,940
Call the name

615
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:09,940
You call the name

616
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:10,940
Call

617
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:13,940
Teacher Yuwen

618
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:16,940
Here

619
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:22,940
Teacher Shu Yuan

620
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:26,940
Here

621
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,940
Teacher Ying Yu

622
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:33,940
I'm here

623
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:38,940
Principal

624
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,940
You dare to call the principal?

625
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:41,940
You are stupid

626
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:42,940
Here

627
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:45,940
Security

628
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:46,940
Here

629
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:48,940
Get up

630
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:50,940
Yes

631
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,940
You said our school is a total of two people

632
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:54,940
You call the name

633
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,940
I'll get the flower bucket

634
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:58,940
Why do you take the flower bucket?

635
00:25:58,940 --> 00:25:59,940
What are you doing?

636
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:00,940
How many years has it been since you took the horn?

637
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:01,940
Is it useful to play with it?

638
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,940
Can you do it without a flower bucket?

639
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:04,940
Take it

640
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:05,940
Take it

641
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,940
This sense of ceremony

642
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:09,940
Another

643
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:10,940
Who has no flower bucket in the meeting?

644
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,940
You don't have a horn

645
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,940
Can you make the effect of the horn?

646
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:16,940
Hello

647
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:24,940
I said

648
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:25,940
I'm here

649
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:28,940
Is it fun?

650
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:29,940
Is it fun?

651
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:32,940
What are you talking about?

652
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:33,940
It's

653
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:35,940
From that Shifan University

654
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,940
A few college students graduated

655
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,940
Ready to come to our school to teach

656
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:40,940
I think this is a good thing

657
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:41,940
What do you think

658
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,940
You said it earlier

659
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:44,940
Go to

660
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:45,940
How to pick up

661
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,940
Our village's highest standard

662
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:48,940
Take the horse to pick up

663
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:49,940
beautiful

664
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,940
It's not here yet

665
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:52,940
It's you

666
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:53,940
Come on

667
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:54,940
The headmaster

668
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,940
Come on

669
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:56,940
I picked it up

670
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:57,940
I saw it

671
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:58,940
Someone picked it up

672
00:26:58,940 --> 00:26:59,940
Headmaster Jia

673
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:00,940
Thank you

674
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:01,940
Thank you

675
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:02,940
Headmaster Jia

676
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:03,940
We came all the way

677
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:04,940
Look at this beautiful landscape

678
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:05,940
It's really good

679
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:06,940
At first I heard

680
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:07,940
Use the horse to pick us up

681
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,940
Really don't need

682
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:10,940
This child speaks

683
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,940
What is the truth?

684
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,940
Why don't you use it?

685
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:15,940
No

686
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,940
We walked here ourselves

687
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:19,940
You didn't pick it up

688
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:20,940
I picked it up

689
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:22,940
He called the horse

690
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,940
I picked it up

691
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,940
Headmaster Jia is really humorous

692
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:31,940
Humorous

693
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:32,940
I think it's still a little bit missing

694
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:34,940
Really

695
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:35,940
Someone came

696
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:36,940
Then I'll go back

697
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:37,940
Then you go to the health

698
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:38,940
No, you come on

699
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:39,940
No, go to eat

700
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:40,940
OK

701
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:41,940
Go in quickly

702
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:42,940
Come back

703
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:43,940
I'll put it outside

704
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:44,940
Oh, my god

705
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:45,940
I'm sorry

706
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,940
The university is so angry

707
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:50,940
Just like the sun at 8 or 9 in the morning

708
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,940
How did the sun set?

709
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,940
Is this your school leader?

710
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,940
No, Headmaster Jia

711
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:02,940
You misunderstood

712
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,940
I am also a college student

713
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,940
I am their junior

714
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:09,940
Why?

715
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:12,940
No, you

716
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:13,940
You are too

717
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:14,940
You said you are my junior

718
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:15,940
I'm not happy

719
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:19,940
Headmaster Jia is so humorous

720
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:21,940
Then hurry up

721
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:22,940
Take the uniform

722
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:23,940
Don't be too happy

723
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:28,940
Just to save cloth

724
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,940
You look a little more like a princess

725
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:33,940
Which one is Zhang Muguir?

726
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:36,940
Headmaster Jia

727
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:37,940
My surname is Zhang

728
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,940
But my name is not Muguir

729
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:40,940
My name is Zhang Lincun

730
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:41,940
Lincun

731
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:50,940
Why did you write this?

732
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:51,940
Yes

733
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:52,940
It's a good name

734
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:53,940
Lincun has a wooden stick

735
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:54,940
What is this?

736
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:55,940
I'm sorry

737
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,940
Come on, sit down

738
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:58,940
Come on, sit down

739
00:28:58,940 --> 00:28:59,940
Take the chair

740
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,940
I'm so happy

741
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,940
This is great

742
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,940
You must be thirsty after coming all the way

743
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:07,940
Pour some water

744
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:12,940
I ask you something

745
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,940
If I don't pour the water, they won't drink

746
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:15,940
Do you believe it?

747
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:16,940
I don't believe it

748
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:17,940
Then pour it

749
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:22,940
Come on, let's drink

750
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:25,940
So good

751
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:27,940
This water is really sweet

752
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:28,940
Sweet?

753
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,940
The small river behind our house

754
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:31,940
The water is sweet and clean

755
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:32,940
It's enough to drink

756
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:34,940
Right, Headmaster Jia

757
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,940
Where do we go if we wash clothes in the future?

758
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,940
The small river behind

759
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:39,940
What about bathing?

760
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:40,940
The river behind

761
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:41,940
What about the toilet?

762
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:42,940
The river behind

763
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:43,940
The toilet next to the river

764
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:44,940
Are you scared?

765
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,940
I'm just kidding

766
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,940
I can let you eat a lasagna

767
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:57,940
And solve it in one river

768
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:01,940
Headmaster Jia

769
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,940
We've heard about your design

770
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,940
You are the only one who is guarding a school in the mountains

771
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:07,940
It's been decades

772
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,940
I'm afraid of being lonely and lonely

773
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:12,940
This time, the Headmaster asked us to come

774
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:13,940
To pick you up from work

775
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:14,940
Don't worry

776
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:15,940
We can definitely suffer

777
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,940
You can retire in honor

778
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,940
This is the letter from the Headmaster

779
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,940
The Headmaster will give you a special delivery

780
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:25,940
I'll take it back

781
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:27,940
Let me tell you

782
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:28,940
Whoever asked me to retire

783
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,940
He won't open a delivery

784
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,940
What is that?

785
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:32,940
A water delivery

786
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:35,940
Come here

787
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:37,940
Come here

788
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:38,940
What's going on?

789
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,940
I was still holding 888 to entertain the guests

790
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,940
But when the guests came, I was the headmaster

791
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,940
You can retire if you want

792
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,940
You've been doing this for a lifetime

793
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:47,940
I think those kids are pretty good

794
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:48,940
What kids?

795
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,940
You have to take care of kids

796
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:52,940
Kids are with kids

797
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:53,940
Isn't that a school card?

798
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,940
What card are you playing?

799
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,940
We have a total of ten kids

800
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:58,940
Ten kids is my life

801
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:00,940
I can give my life to them

802
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,940
Have you finished the notification on your book?

803
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:04,940
I'll make a statement to notify

804
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:05,940
What?

805
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:06,940
Get out of here

806
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:08,940
What are you doing?

807
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:10,940
Delivery

808
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:11,940
Headmaster

809
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:13,940
We're here to give instructions

810
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,940
If I'm not capable enough

811
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:16,940
You can let me go

812
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:17,940
If you're not capable enough

813
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:18,940
Can you just leave?

814
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:21,940
If you doubt our capabilities

815
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:22,940
Let's make a match

816
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:23,940
Okay

817
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:24,940
How about this?

818
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,940
Let's make a match

819
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:27,940
Whoever loses, leaves

820
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:31,940
You go first

821
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:32,940
What are you doing?

822
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:33,940
I'm a master of art

823
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:34,940
I'm a professional piano player

824
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:35,940
I'm a professional violin player

825
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,940
You're just a little bit of a master

826
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:41,940
What?

827
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:42,940
You're a master of violin

828
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,940
What does your DJ playing have to do with me?

829
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,940
Because I'm not comparing with you

830
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:47,940
Please excuse me

831
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:53,940
As the saying goes

832
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,940
Good men don't fight with women

833
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,940
But I have a character

834
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,940
That's like a tiger in the mountains

835
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:01,940
Come on, lady

836
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:02,940
Let's make a match

837
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:03,940
What are you doing?

838
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:04,940
Hello, Headmaster Jiang

839
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:05,940
I'm a major in science and science

840
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,940
I was the top student in science and science in the province during the college entrance examination

841
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:09,940
During college

842
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:10,940
I represented the school

843
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:13,940
And won the Olympic Maths Competition

844
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,940
My graduation thesis was also included in the textbook

845
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:18,940
By California University in the United States

846
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:20,940
I envy you

847
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,940
But what does that have to do with me?

848
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:25,940
I just want to pass you by

849
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,940
And talk to this little kid

850
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,940
What do you think you're doing?

851
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:30,940
I'm teaching sports

852
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:31,940
You're teaching sports

853
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:32,940
You're laughing at me

854
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:33,940
I'm teaching sports

855
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:34,940
Come here

856
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:37,940
You can't even stop me from teaching you sports

857
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,940
You're teaching sports

858
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,940
How do you want to develop your language?

859
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:48,940
Three

860
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:50,940
Four

861
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:51,940
Five

862
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:52,940
Six

863
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:54,940
Hurry up, hurry up

864
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:55,940
Don't move your stomach

865
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:56,940
It's not appropriate to move your stomach

866
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:58,940
Since you're teaching sports

867
00:32:58,940 --> 00:32:59,940
And you're so sharp

868
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:00,940
I want to ask you

869
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:01,940
What are you doing?

870
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:02,940
Let's compete

871
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:03,940
Let's let you compete

872
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:04,940
Let's compete

873
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:05,940
Let's make a math test

874
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:06,940
You can pick whatever you want

875
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:07,940
Come on

876
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:08,940
Brother-in-law

877
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:09,940
We're on the same side

878
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,940
I just want to ease the embarrassment

879
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:14,940
Master Jiang

880
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:15,940
We don't have to go

881
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:16,940
You have to go this time

882
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,940
Our major is fine

883
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:20,940
Your major is too bad

884
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:21,940
It's not a problem

885
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,940
You guys are so proud

886
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,940
Our temple can't use you

887
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:27,940
You just got up to the top 10

888
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:28,940
You're in our top 10

889
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:29,940
You're in the top 10

890
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,940
Who else can afford a piano?

891
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:35,940
Play

892
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:38,940
And you, big girl

893
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:40,940
You and I are like family

894
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,940
And there's an Olympic competition

895
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:43,940
What's the use?

896
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,940
Our kids can walk out of this mountain

897
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,940
That's our dream

898
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:49,940
Especially you

899
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:50,940
I don't like you

900
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:52,940
You're not tall

901
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:53,940
You should get a piece of shoulder meat

902
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:54,940
What's the use?

903
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:55,940
Our kids are not really nourished

904
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:56,940
To sing the song

905
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:57,940
You should get a piece of shoulder meat

906
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:58,940
You should get a piece of shoulder meat

907
00:33:58,940 --> 00:33:59,940
And stew it

908
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:02,940
I'm telling you

909
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,940
You should figure out what's in this book

910
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:05,940
That's it

911
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:06,940
That's what you get

912
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:08,940
We can figure out what's in this book

913
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:10,940
You're too bold

914
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:12,940
Come on, you figure it out

915
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,940
You can just read the textbook

916
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,940
See if I can accept you on behalf of the kids

917
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:19,940
Swim

918
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:20,940
Swim

919
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:21,940
Swim, swim, swim

920
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:22,940
The direction is like the sky

921
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:23,940
White hair, green water

922
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:24,940
Red palm, wave your hand

923
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:25,940
Stop it

924
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:26,940
I told you to peel the goose

925
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:27,940
You never listen to me

926
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:29,940
Why did you read the goose

927
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,940
And you can smell the goose

928
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:35,940
Then what should I read?

929
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:36,940
You should be clear-headed

930
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,940
You should let the kids remember it

931
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:52,940
Look at me

932
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,940
I read the goose's size

933
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:57,940
A goose with a small goose

934
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:04,940
The direction is like the sky

935
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,940
White hair, green water

936
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:13,940
Red palm

937
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,940
I didn't understand the last sentence

938
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:20,940
This performance is too exciting

939
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:21,940
Let's do it the other way

940
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:22,940
Red palm

941
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:26,940
You're peeling the goose

942
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:27,940
I'm peeling the goose

943
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,940
Why did you know to shield yourself?

944
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:31,940
You're a brave goose

945
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:33,940
Don't be a brave goose

946
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:34,940
Go, go with the team

947
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:35,940
Go, go

948
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:36,940
I can't go

949
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:37,940
Brother-in-law

950
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:39,940
Can you stop it?

951
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:41,940
Can't you just rest?

952
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:42,940
How can I rest?

953
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,940
Can I teach the kids?

954
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,940
Who can sit and watch the four of you

955
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:48,940
And teach the kids?

956
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,940
Can't you just let the kids learn how to grind the beans?

957
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,940
If you can't get up, you can't grind it

958
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,940
What can the kids eat and drink?

959
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,940
Like the food delivery in your city

960
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:57,940
The beans are here

961
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:58,940
They're all beans

962
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:00,940
I'm not leaving

963
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,940
The school is my home

964
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,940
The kids are my life

965
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:06,940
This is my root

966
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:08,940
I can't leave

967
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:10,940
I'm telling you

968
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:11,940
I'll call the school committee

969
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:12,940
I'll let you guys go

970
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,940
You're the one who called

971
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:17,940
I don't believe it

972
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:18,940
Brother-in-law

973
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:22,940
Lin Kun

974
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:25,940
No, let's go back first

975
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:26,940
What do you mean?

976
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:27,940
Isn't he sick?

977
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:28,940
Yes

978
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:31,940
He's sick

979
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:34,940
You guys

980
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:36,940
You don't know

981
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:39,940
My brother-in-law has been in poor health for the past few years

982
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,940
I went to the hospital with him for a physical examination last month

983
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:43,940
I found out

984
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:44,940
I'm sorry

985
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:48,940
Wanqi

986
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:53,940
Everyone in the village knows

987
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,940
Only he doesn't know

988
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,940
Do you know why you came here?

989
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:01,940
It's the people in the village who wrote to the school committee

990
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:02,940
Tell them the situation

991
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:05,940
Teachers

992
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:08,940
Thank you

993
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:10,940
Can come to our mountain ditch

994
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:12,940
I have one request

995
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,940
You guys take my brother-in-law

996
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:17,940
As a child

997
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:22,940
Accompany him to complete the last wish

998
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:25,940
Is it okay?

999
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:38,940
Teacher Gao

1000
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:43,940
When will our school's teaching building be completed?

1001
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,940
It will be sealed soon

1002
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,940
It will be moved in a few days

1003
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:48,940
That's great

1004
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:50,940
Teacher Zhang

1005
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:53,940
The dormitory building is almost completed

1006
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:54,940
When the school starts

1007
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,940
The children can live in the new dormitory

1008
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:00,940
By the way

1009
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:04,940
When will the university teacher recommended by the committee arrive?

1010
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:05,940
Go to pick up

1011
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:06,940
Go to pick up

1012
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,940
His son, the son of the teacher

1013
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,940
Go to pick up at four or four o'clock

1014
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:13,940
Teacher Zhang

1015
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:14,940
Teacher Zhang

1016
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,940
The adults have picked you up

1017
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:17,940
Little four

1018
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:18,940
I'll go back when the people arrive

1019
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:19,940
Teacher Zhang

1020
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:20,940
Children, thank you

1021
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:21,940
It's okay

1022
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:23,940
Hello everyone

1023
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:28,940
May I ask

1024
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,940
Is this Qianfu Taichun Experimental Elementary School?

1025
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:33,940
You

1026
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:34,940
You are

1027
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,940
President Zhang Mugun, right?

1028
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:39,940
Yes

1029
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:42,940
I am a freshman in Shifan University

1030
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:43,940
I am self-taught

1031
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:44,940
My name is

1032
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:46,940
Wang Juntai

1033
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,940
Why don't I give you a test?

1034
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:54,940
Come

1035
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:58,940
Hello everyone

1036
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:00,940
Today

1037
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,940
I will teach you a poem

1038
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:04,940
This poem

1039
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:07,940
Is the famous Tang Dynasty poet

1040
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,940
King Luo Bin wrote

1041
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,940
Eternity

1042
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:34,940
