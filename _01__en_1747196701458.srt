00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,820
theorem

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,440
I look left, right, up, down

3
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,480
I still can't see where it looks like me

4
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,480
I was kidding with him

5
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,480
It's so ugly

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,200
It's not like mom at all

7
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,160
My son explained seriously

8
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,080
I'm going to put on makeup for him

9
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,200
Son

10
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,160
You have to draw it well

11
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,160
Oh my god

12
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,160
You guys

13
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,720
Report to headquarters

14
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,320
I have arrived at the rescue site

15
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,960
Where is the rescue personnel?

16
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:05,840
Brother brother

17
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,400
Don't interfere with my work

18
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
Brother brother

19
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,520
Look at me

20
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,520
Look at me

21
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,520
I didn't look at you

22
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,800
Look at me look at me

23
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,520
I

24
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,960
You have to be my big brother

25
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,920
I have no eyes

26
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,480
You

27
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,720
You just take a mirror with you

28
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,400
Oh my god

29
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,040
Aren't you good?

30
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,240
I am an egg-breaking expert Xiong Ziqi

31
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,520
Now I'm here to rescue you

32
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,720
You just calm down and it's over

33
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,880
No, I can't calm down

34
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,840
From the beginning

35
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,000
I was afraid when I saw the bomb for the first time

36
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,840
It's okay

37
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,800
Don't worry

38
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,280
I'll save you, don't worry

39
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,720
As an egg-breaking expert

40
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,240
I have a natural advantage over others

41
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,400
Natural advantage

42
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,600
Yeah

43
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,600
Can't kill you

44
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,160
I have a compulsive disorder

45
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,640
Compulsive disorder

46
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,920
I also have night blindness

47
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,600
Is it because you're an egg-breaking expert?

48
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,600
Because I have compulsive disorder

49
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,440
I'm not allowed to make any mistakes

50
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,080
So in my task

51
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,360
I've never failed

52
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,600
Come on, let me see your egg

53
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,120
Hold it for me

54
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,920
Your egg

55
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,120
I'm familiar with your egg

56
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,160
You just give up and calm down

57
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,080
It's over in a minute

58
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,920
It's okay

59
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,240
What's wrong with you?

60
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,360
This egg

61
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,600
You're too ugly

62
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,560
You're a fake egg

63
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,000
You apologize to the bomb again

64
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,520
What do you apologize to the bomb for?

65
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,320
Save me

66
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,800
I can't save you if you don't apologize

67
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,720
I feel bad

68
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,320
Okay

69
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,040
I apologize

70
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,400
Egg-breaking expert

71
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:34,960
I'm sorry

72
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,080
I'm too ugly

73
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,080
Don't bomb me

74
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,560
You go to bomb others

75
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,120
Okay, it's over

76
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,120
Save me, hurry up

77
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,160
Cut the line

78
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,360
I'll overcome it

79
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,120
I'll do it

80
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,440
Hurry up

81
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,160
Head shape

82
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,760
What's this?

83
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,240
Head shape

84
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,400
You don't match

85
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,800
I'll straighten it for you

86
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,200
You're so annoying

87
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,120
Hurry up

88
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,040
Where are you?

89
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,240
Stop blowing

90
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,320
Where are you?

91
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,200
Oh, my God

92
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,440
Look at your hair

93
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,280
I feel so bad

94
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,440
Look at you

95
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,280
You're not good at it

96
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,120
Hurry up, bro

97
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,960
I'm too handsome this time

98
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,640
I'm out of time

99
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,800
Hurry up

100
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,400
Okay, I'll take it off for you this time

101
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,920
Don't worry

102
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,400
Come on, it's too short

103
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,800
Are you ready?

104
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,800
What?

105
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,760
Are you really ready?

106
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,480
Yes

107
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,280
Hurry up

108
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,880
Oh, my God

109
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,000
What's wrong with you?

110
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,920
Are you trying to make me angry?

111
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,840
What's wrong with me?

112
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,200
You're all so ugly

113
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,840
You're still ugly when you talk

114
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,120
Oh, my God

115
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,360
Well

116
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,480
You have to say that

117
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,280
What's that called?

118
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,080
The tongue-twister, right?

119
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,640
Come on, give me the tongue-twister

120
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,280
I'm sorry

121
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,040
Stop talking

122
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,920
Hurry up, cut the line

123
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,720
It's time to say goodbye

124
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,200
I can't take it if you don't say it

125
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,360
Say it, hurry up

126
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,160
I'm so sad

127
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,000
Hurry up

128
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:12,620
Black

129
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,360
Oh

130
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,880
There's no black tongue-twister at all

131
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,200
There are white and gray tongue-twisters

132
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,560
White tongue-twisters are for urine

133
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,200
Gray tongue-twisters are for urine

134
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,440
Right?

135
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,680
It seems to be

136
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,200
It's a curse

137
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,280
This mouth should say

138
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,560
White tongue-twister urine is white

139
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,840
Gray tongue-twister

140
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,640
It's gray

141
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,840
Put it in the ground and run to the middle

142
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,440
White tongue-twister urine is white

143
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,280
Yes

144
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,360
Gray hair is gray

145
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,840
Two men play gray

146
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,600
Yes

147
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,560
What's right?

148
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,080
Are you going to run?

149
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,760
I said I'm not singing

150
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,640
But when I sing

151
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm not singing

152
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,160
I sing and say

153
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,600
Brother, hurry up and cut the line

154
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,240
I'm going to die in the office

155
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,560
You're talking so hard

156
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,000
What song are you singing?

157
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,000
I sing the second person

158
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,400
The second person is good

159
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,240
The second person is good

160
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,240
We love to listen

161
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,280
Come on

162
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,160
Oh, brother

163
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,120
Hurry up and cut the line

164
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,720
Don't let me sing

165
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,480
You sing or not

166
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:21,960
Don't sing

167
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,200
I can't guess if you don't sing

168
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,040
Can't guess

169
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,960
I don't sing

170
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,240
If you don't guess, I'll leave

171
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,240
A

172
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,560
A

173
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,840
Little donkey calls me a good cup of tea

174
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,720
All right

175
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,320
Don't sing

176
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,200
Standing in the blue sun

177
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,800
The second person is good

178
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,480
The second person is good

179
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:52,040
A

180
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,000
Cut the line

181
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,920
Hurry up and cut the line

182
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,400
Oh my god

183
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,040
You're so bad

184
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,440
You don't know the front

185
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,520
Just the last A

186
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,880
I don't know what to do

187
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,600
What's the A?

188
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,120
It's A

189
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,040
Teach me

190
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,960
The second person is good

191
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,440
Yellow

192
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,040
A

193
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:18,520
No, A

194
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:25,240
A

195
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,240
That's it, right?

196
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,280
It's good

197
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:27,840
You know it, right?

198
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,320
I know

199
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,520
OK, I'll practice by myself

200
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:29,880
OK

201
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,120
These kids are so talented

202
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,840
If you don't sing, you'll be so stupid

203
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,240
Hurry up

204
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,520
Come back

205
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,920
I'm so angry

206
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,360
You don't think you're

207
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,400
Do you forget something?

208
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,480
What did I forget?

209
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,840
You didn't pay the tuition

210
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,560
What tuition?

211
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,760
Guess

212
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,280
Hurry up

213
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,200
Guess

214
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,000
What's this?

215
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,800
This is so loud

216
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm looking

217
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Guess

218
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Oh my god

219
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Oh my god

220
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,040
Are you trying to kill me?

221
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,960
What's wrong with you?

222
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,800
Your shoelaces

223
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,800
Why don't you have a pair of shoes?

224
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,600
Can't you take it off?

225
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,600
Take it off

226
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,400
What's wrong with you?

227
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,080
Are you trying to kill me?

228
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,200
Can you kill me?

229
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:30,800
You wear socks

230
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,760
You wear two shoes

231
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,400
I can't stand it

232
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,400
Where's your money?

233
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,400
Here

234
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,400
Take it

235
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,400
Is it a good deal?

236
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,400
Look at the bottom

237
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,400
Is it black?

238
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,400
Is it black?

239
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,400
What's wrong?

240
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,400
Is it big?

241
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,400
Big

242
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,400
No, 42

243
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,400
It's big

244
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,400
OK

245
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,400
I'm so bad at guessing

246
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,400
Time

247
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,400
Time

248
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,400
Oh my god

249
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,400
Back

250
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,400
OK

251
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,400
I'm so scared

252
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,400
Oh my god, I'm finally done

253
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,400
Great

254
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,400
I'm so lucky

255
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,400
I have 1 minute and 1 second left

256
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,400
What about me?

257
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,400
1 minute and 1 second

258
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,400
Oh my god

259
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,400
You're trying to kill me

260
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,400
How can you do this?

261
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,400
I can't stand it

262
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,400
What are you doing?

263
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,400
Don't move

264
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,400
Stand up

265
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,400
What?

266
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,400
I'll help you

267
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,400
Come on

268
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,400
OK

269
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,400
Let's go

270
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,400
No

271
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,400
No, I have 1 more second

272
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,400
I have 1 more second

273
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,400
This is a forced certificate

274
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,400
Are you crazy?

275
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,400
I have 1 more second

276
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,400
I have 1 more second

277
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,400
Hello, everyone

278
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,400
I'm Song Erlong, who is shouting in the big head

279
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,400
Do you know me?

280
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,400
I'm the famous artist of our village

281
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,400
As long as the leaders come to our village

282
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,400
Our village director will let me play different roles

283
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,400
Acting for the leaders

284
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,400
Mainly to brag

285
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,400
Just call me like this

286
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,400
There must be someone else up there

287
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,400
Can I help him fool the leaders today?

288
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,400
Yes

289
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,400
Who said yes?

290
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,400
How can you come up?

291
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,400
Such a beautiful girl

292
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,400
How dare you do anything?

293
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,400
Song Erlong

294
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,400
Director

295
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,400
Are you going to turn the world upside down?

296
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,400
Why are you so late?

297
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,400
I'm here

298
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,400
The inspection team will be here soon

299
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,400
The old rules

300
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,400
Go up at the critical moment

301
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,400
To brag about me in front of the leaders

302
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,400
OK, the old rules

303
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,400
Give me your lines today

304
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,400
I forgot such an important thing

305
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,400
Then it's over

306
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,400
How can I brag if you don't give me the lines?

307
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,400
It doesn't matter

308
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,400
You just say I've done those good things

309
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,400
Have you done good things?

310
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,400
Do I have to brag about you?

311
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,400
Director

312
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,400
Can you change the person?

313
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,400
There are so many people in our village

314
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,400
You can't let me suffer alone

315
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,400
I can't bear to see your face

316
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,400
Everyone look at this face

317
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,400
How deceitful

318
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,400
The hat is thick and the face is pure

319
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,400
Director means I'm not lying

320
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,400
I'm lying to you

321
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,400
You bastard

322
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,400
Director

323
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,400
Look at the villages around us

324
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,400
The village director has brought everyone

325
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,400
To live a good life

326
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,400
The village director has brought everyone

327
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,400
To build a dam in the water area

328
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,400
Now they are green ecological sources

329
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,400
And the yellow rice village

330
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,400
It used to be a famous poor village

331
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,400
The village director brought everyone

332
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,400
To build a food processing plant

333
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,400
They have already been out of poverty

334
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,400
You want to be like them

335
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,400
All right

336
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,400
Look at those village directors

337
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,400
Tired

338
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,400
Can't even stand up

339
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,400
Look at my waist

340
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,400
Where is your waist?

341
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,400
It's none of your business

342
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,400
My waist is still strong

343
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,400
This big waist

344
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:10,400
Advertisment

345
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,120
I'm waiting for the defense to be destroyed.

346
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,840
Sister Wu, I will play the director today.

347
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,760
But you can't stand this scene alone.

348
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,960
I hired a leading role.

349
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,320
You play him.

350
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:40,880
What?

351
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,600
There is a girl who can act in our village?

352
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,120
The new son-in-law of Liu.

353
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,440
From the county theater troupe.

354
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,760
Can the county theater troupe do this for you?

355
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,080
If he doesn't do it,

356
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,360
I won't give him the title of old man.

357
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,080
The title is a policy set by the state.

358
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,520
You don't give it.

359
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,520
What?

360
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,280
I'm the master of my place.

361
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,680
What is that?

362
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,640
A donkey.

363
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,640
A donkey?

364
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,800
I want to say he is a horse.

365
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,520
Who dares to say he is a donkey?

366
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:09,240
A donkey.

367
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,760
Do you dare?

368
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,000
I don't dare.

369
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,080
You just say he is you.

370
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,280
We have no opinion.

371
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,320
Master, the meeting is over.

372
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,760
Wait a minute.

373
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,080
The son-in-law of Liu has come here.

374
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,840
I don't know him.

375
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,600
I haven't seen him.

376
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,720
I haven't seen him either.

377
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,080
It's okay.

378
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,400
He came here by car.

379
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,880
He hasn't done this job yet.

380
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,000
You tell him the truth.

381
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,360
When the inspection team arrives,

382
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,600
you two go out

383
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,800
and give me a high-fives.

384
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,520
High-fives.

385
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,680
High-fives.

386
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,960
Look at the shape.

387
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,680
It's high.

388
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,400
It looks like a ball.

389
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,960
Where can I give you a high-fives?

390
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,320
Yes.

391
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,640
I'm a high-fives.

392
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,600
Leader,

393
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,040
this time the case was very good.

394
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,440
Only the director of the village

395
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,280
has a lot of people's opinions.

396
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:55,920
Yes.

397
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,920
I just want to see

398
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,840
how they act.

399
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,520
Yes.

400
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,120
You're here.

401
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,360
The son-in-law of Liu

402
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,000
is here to help the village director.

403
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,120
Act?

404
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,040
The leader is here.

405
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,880
He's here to help the director

406
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,320
and to fool the leader.

407
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,720
Come on.

408
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,520
Come on.

409
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,160
What are you doing?

410
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,440
You're here to act, right?

411
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,640
The conditions are good.

412
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,400
The martial arts are very good.

413
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,400
I tell you.

414
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,240
When the leader comes,

415
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,080
you should be more energetic.

416
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,960
Don't be so picky.

417
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,400
Don't always be picky.

418
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,640
I'm not picky.

419
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,960
I'm serious.

420
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,360
You're serious?

421
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,320
Oh my god.

422
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,280
These eyes are so selfish.

423
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,280
If he can see others,

424
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,480
others can't see him.

425
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,360
What do you mean?

426
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,280
Nothing.

427
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,400
I'm serious.

428
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,480
What do you mean?

429
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,880
I'm serious.

430
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,720
Oh my god.

431
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,320
The son-in-law of the village

432
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,920
is so serious.

433
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,160
The daughter-in-law?

434
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,560
Come on.

435
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,600
What are you counting?

436
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,160
The pig.

437
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,520
It's the 60th of the New Year.

438
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,520
Yes.

439
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,640
The pig of 36.

440
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,520
Oh my god.

441
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,080
Who can see it?

442
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,920
The face is so ugly.

443
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,440
So ugly.

444
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,720
What's wrong with you?

445
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,920
Nothing.

446
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,440
Oh my god.

447
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,840
I understand that you're here.

448
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,440
You're here for your father-in-law.

449
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,600
I'm here to ask for our house's

450
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,640
renovation money.

451
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,440
Otherwise, who can do this?

452
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,560
What do we do?

453
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,640
The director said

454
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,840
when the leader comes,

455
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,640
we'll rush up

456
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,920
and blow him up.

457
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,920
Blow him up?

458
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,840
What good things did he do?

459
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,400
He did good things.

460
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,240
He didn't even do human things.

461
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,960
He...

462
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,000
That's a lie.

463
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,240
Oh my god.

464
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,320
Oh my god.

465
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,160
The actor

466
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,000
is the first one in the crew.

467
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,800
He's so good.

468
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,320
He can open his eyes.

469
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,120
Oh my god.

470
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,760
You'll be here soon.

471
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,080
Your father-in-law will come down.

472
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,200
Oh, right.

473
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,520
You won't play the role of Di Bao, right?

474
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,120
The director won't say that.

475
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,280
He'll let you wait.

476
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,880
When will I wait?

477
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,440
When Di Bao comes down,

478
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,560
your father-in-law

479
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,920
will lie down

480
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,280
without any pain.

481
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,840
He'll be like a father-in-law.

482
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,560
What does it mean?

483
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,360
He'll be like a father-in-law.

484
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,360
Listen.

485
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,680
When the leader comes,

486
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,960
we'll rush up and blow him up.

487
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,760
No way.

488
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,560
I don't know what's going on.

489
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,760
I can't just blow him up.

490
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,480
I'm afraid he'll blow up.

491
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,360
Don't blow him up.

492
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,360
If you change my room,

493
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,880
I'll be in trouble.

494
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,760
Come on.

495
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,880
Read this letter.

496
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,160
I read it once last time.

497
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,840
It's not from the same group.

498
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,960
You wrote it?

499
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,360
I did.

500
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,560
The owner spent money on his old friend.

501
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,200
Should I memorize it?

502
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,520
You can't memorize it.

503
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,640
I've read this for half a year.

504
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,880
I can't memorize it.

505
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,880
Why?

506
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,880
It's not a word from a painting.

507
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,880
It's hard to memorize.

508
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,480
I really want to see

509
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,480
what it means if it's not a painting.

510
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,280
A miracle in a small village.

511
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,280
Rush out.

512
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,880
You can't read it like that.

513
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,280
The director wants a high-end.

514
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,080
You have to work hard.

515
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,080
Work hard.

516
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,480
Think about your father-in-law.

517
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,680
He's poor.

518
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,280
He's poor.

519
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,280
A miracle in a small village.

520
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,880
Rush out of Asia.

521
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,480
A trick of the country.

522
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,680
Let's set a small goal.

523
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,880
Let's make two hundred million first.

524
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,480
One year, two hundred million.

525
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,680
The director is a remote control.

526
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,880
Remote control.

527
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,880
One launch.

528
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,080
History records are all broken.

529
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,080
Breaking records.

530
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,280
The first place.

531
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,280
The director is a excavator.

532
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,280
The excavator is stronger.

533
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,280
The director is showing off to fly.

534
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,880
To fly.

535
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,280
Ha ha ha.

536
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:49,880
Alright.

537
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,280
The old man is down.

538
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,680
You guys are acting like this?

539
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,480
This is too easy.

540
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,080
Oh my god.

541
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,680
You're a county group.

542
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,080
You look down on people.

543
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,280
You're too easy to act.

544
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,080
You're a man.

545
00:16:59,080 --> 00:16:59,680
Try it.

546
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,680
Is there a man?

547
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,880
Of course.

548
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,880
When the last leader came,

549
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,280
the director asked me to act a remote control.

550
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,480
A man.

551
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,680
You've ever acted this?

552
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,480
Oh.

553
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,480
Then you show us.

554
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,280
Don't make trouble.

555
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,480
Show us.

556
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,680
The crowd's cheering.

557
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,480
You don't act.

558
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,280
I don't know how to act.

559
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,680
You...

560
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,080
Put this song down.

561
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,080
There's music?

562
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,080
Of course.

563
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,280
When the leader came,

564
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,880
the director arranged a big party.

565
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,880
Put this song down.

566
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,080
To make the atmosphere better.

567
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,080
The director gave me this song.

568
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,480
I usually practice with it.

569
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,080
Start.

570
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,280
It's in the play.

571
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,880
Okay.

572
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,680
Leader.

573
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,680
Thank you.

574
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:06,280
I want to live in this remote village.

575
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,280
Actually, we're doing great.

576
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,680
Because we have a good leader.

577
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,680
Who?

578
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,680
He...

579
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,680
He...

580
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,880
He...

581
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,480
He's the village director.

582
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,880
The director...

583
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,880
He...

584
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,680
He...

585
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,080
Young man.

586
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,680
You're really crying.

587
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,480
I can't stop crying.

588
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,080
Last time, I just got wet.

589
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,280
The director fined me 500 yuan.

590
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,480
500?

591
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,280
Your director is so good.

592
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,280
Why did you choose him?

593
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:46,880
Oh my god.

594
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,280
This is a good question.

595
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,280
Let me tell you.

596
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,680
The village director said

597
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,080
our director has a trick.

598
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:52,880
Look.

599
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,080
When you choose the director,

600
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,080
you can vote for two candidates.

601
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:57,880
The director said,

602
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,880
the first vote,

603
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,280
you can vote for yourself.

604
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,480
Humanity.

605
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,280
The second vote,

606
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,480
you must vote for me.

607
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,680
Be humble.

608
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,880
The last vote,

609
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,280
the village men and women,

610
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,880
everyone got one vote.

611
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,480
Our director got the most votes.

612
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,880
He chose.

613
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,080
He chose?

614
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,080
Yes.

615
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,880
Isn't there anyone you're afraid of?

616
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,680
He's afraid of the people above.

617
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,080
Last time, a leader came and said,

618
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,280
what's going on?

619
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,880
He was scared and made a fuss at home for days.

620
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,880
Oh.

621
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,880
What if I'm the one above?

622
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,080
You're above.

623
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,880
Go up there.

624
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,280
Hey, Sun Erlong.

625
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,080
Director.

626
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,080
You can go back now.

627
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,680
No, I'm not acting.

628
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,480
What are you acting?

629
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,080
It's already this time.

630
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,080
The police won't come.

631
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,280
You changed my uniform to a suit.

632
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,080
You didn't act.

633
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,480
Why would I wear a suit?

634
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,280
If I didn't act, it wouldn't be me.

635
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,480
Then it's me.

636
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,480
Didn't the procuratorate come?

637
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,480
Why didn't the procuratorate come?

638
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,480
You're afraid the procuratorate will come?

639
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,080
If you have the ability, go find it.

640
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,680
I'll give you a suit now.

641
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,680
How do you know I can't find it?

642
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,680
What do you mean?

643
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,880
What do you mean?

644
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,480
The procuratorate is here.

645
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,480
Where?

646
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,880
There.

647
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,080
The procuratorate.

648
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,680
Stand up.

649
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,880
The procuratorate is here.

650
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,880
They're counting on you.

651
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,880
Help me.

652
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,680
You are?

653
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,880
My surname is Gao.

654
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,880
I'm from the Procuratorate.

655
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,880
The high-ranking is here.

656
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,280
You're not talking nonsense, are you?

657
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,080
No.

658
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,280
Act.

659
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,280
What?

660
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,280
Act.

661
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,280
Act.

662
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,280
Act?

663
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,280
He didn't give me a ticket

664
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,480
and he didn't give me a ticket.

665
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,480
Can I act?

666
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,480
Yes.

667
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,480
He didn't give me a ticket.

668
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,480
What's going on?

669
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,480
What's going on?

670
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,480
He's already paid.

671
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,480
Take it.

672
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,480
Can the old man pay with his wallet?

673
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,480
What's going on with the wallet?

674
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,480
He's already paid.

675
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,480
Take it.

676
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,480
Then you'll have to pay me 500 yuan.

677
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,680
What's going on?

678
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,680
What's going on?

679
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,680
He's a little hesitant, isn't he?

680
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,680
Pay.

681
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,680
I'm here.

682
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,680
Take it.

683
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,680
I don't want to fight.

684
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,680
Leader, did you see that?

685
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,680
The public interest is not small.

686
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,680
I'm doing my best to help the villagers.

687
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,680
Although I'm sick,

688
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,680
my waist is not good.

689
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,680
What's going on with his waist?

690
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,880
His waist is big and fat.

691
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,880
Leader, I'll answer the phone.

692
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,880
I didn't expect you to be so good.

693
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,880
It's a pity that you're just a trap.

694
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,880
If you're really from the inspection team,

695
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,880
you should hide.

696
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,880
Yes.

697
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,880
Chief Gao is here.

698
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,880
Chief Gao, please answer the phone.

699
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,880
You should hide.

700
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,080
Chief Gao.

701
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,080
You're here.

702
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,080
See you at the village committee.

703
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,080
What's going on?

704
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,080
You're really Chief Gao.

705
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,080
Your eyes are not small.

706
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,080
My eyes are too small.

707
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,280
Leader, he can't talk.

708
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,280
He's telling the truth.

709
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,280
You're acting with us every day.

710
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,280
Why do other villages live a good life?

711
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,280
Because all the village leaders

712
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,280
are thinking about

713
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,280
doing good deeds for the people every day.

714
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,280
You're thinking about

715
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,280
how to fool the leaders.

716
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,280
Can the people live a good life?

717
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,280
Leader.

718
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,280
Your situation

719
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,280
has been taken over by the organization.

720
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,280
I'll talk to you later.

721
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,280
What do you mean by talking to me?

722
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,480
You want to be a dog?

723
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,480
We'll talk about it later.

724
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,480
I'm a dog too.

725
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,480
Do you dare to

726
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,480
make your words into materials?

727
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,480
I dare.

728
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,480
I dare to sign and print.

729
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,480
The party and the government support us.

730
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,480
We're not afraid of anything.

731
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,480
Leader.

732
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,480
I admit

733
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,480
I have many shortcomings and shortcomings in my work.

734
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,480
But I never forget

735
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,480
I was born with hardships.

736
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,480
I'm a farmer's son.

737
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,680
I know I'm a poor farmer's son.

738
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,920
When you didn't give the people a land

739
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,920
how could you not think of the farmers as your father?

740
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,480
When you blocked the people's

741
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,480
illegal reform, how could you not think of

742
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,480
the people as your father?

743
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,480
When you were in the village

744
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,480
how could you not think of the farmers as your father?

745
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,480
Well said.

746
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,480
What's wrong, brother-in-law?

747
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,480
Your hairstyle is like a girl's firewood.

748
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,480
I'm a girl's mushroom.

749
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,480
Your tongue is changed by the shoelaces.

750
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,480
What are you doing here?

751
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,480
The girl is against the tide.

752
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,480
No, the firewood is against the tide.

753
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,480
What are you doing?

754
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,480
Why are you late today?

755
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,480
I'm stuck in traffic.

756
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,480
There's only one road in our village.

757
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,480
I can't see anyone for the whole life.

758
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,480
Who blocked you?

759
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,480
Are you blind?

760
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,480
I'm late.

761
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,480
Then you should say you're late.

762
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,480
I'm not afraid you'll beat me.

763
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,480
I'll beat you harder.

764
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,480
I'll know it now.

765
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,480
Let's have a meeting.

766
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,480
What meeting?

767
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,480
The 48th

768
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,480
National University of Education

769
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,480
The 48th National University of Education

770
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,480
Brother-in-law

771
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,480
Is it necessary to have a meeting

772
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,480
in our school size?

773
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,480
The scale is small, but it's necessary to be formal.

774
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,480
We have a ceremony.

775
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,480
Call the name.

776
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,480
Call it.

777
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,480
Mr. Yuwen.

778
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,480
I'm here.

779
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,480
Mr. Shu Jue.

780
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,480
Call it.

781
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,480
Mr. Ying Yu.

782
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,480
I'm here.

783
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,480
Mr. Yu.

784
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,480
You dare to call it.

785
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,480
Call it.

786
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,480
Security.

787
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,480
Get up.

788
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,480
Our school is only two of us.

789
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,480
You're the one who ordered it.

790
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,480
Give me the microphone.

791
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,480
Why do you take the microphone?

792
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,480
It's been years.

793
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,480
Can't you have a meeting without a microphone?

794
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,480
Give it to me.

795
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,480
It's a ceremony.

796
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,480
Who doesn't have a microphone in a meeting?

797
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,480
You can't make a sound without a microphone.

798
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,480
Can you make a sound effect?

799
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,480
Hello?

800
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,480
Hello?

801
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,480
Hello?

802
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,480
Hello?

803
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,480
Hello?

804
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,480
Hello?

805
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,480
Hello?

806
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,480
Is it fun?

807
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,480
Is it fun?

808
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,480
What are you talking about?

809
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,480
A few college students graduated from this university.

810
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,480
They are going to teach at our university.

811
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,480
I think it's a good thing.

812
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,480
What do you think?

813
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,480
You've already said it.

814
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,480
How to do it?

815
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,360
The highest standard is to pick up the horse

816
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:49,860
Beautiful

817
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:52,260
It's not yet here

818
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,260
President Jia

819
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:53,760
Here

820
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,760
President Jia

821
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,260
Come

822
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,760
Someone picked up

823
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,260
Someone picked up

824
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,760
President Jia

825
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,760
Thank you, thank you, thank you

826
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,760
President Jia

827
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,760
We have been here

828
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,260
Seeing this mountain and water show

829
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,260
It's really good

830
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:05,760
Yes

831
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,260
At first I heard that

832
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,760
Use the horse to pick us up

833
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,760
Really don't need

834
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,260
This still speaks

835
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,260
The one who is honest

836
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:15,260
Why don't you use it after using it

837
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:18,260
No, we walked here ourselves

838
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,260
You didn't pick it up

839
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,260
I picked it up

840
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,260
What?

841
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,260
He called the horse

842
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,260
President Jia is really humorous

843
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:32,260
Humorous? I think it's still a little bit missing

844
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:34,260
President

845
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,260
Someone is here, then I will go back

846
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,260
Then you go to the health care

847
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,260
No, you go to the health care

848
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,260
No, go to eat

849
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,260
Hurry up and go in

850
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,260
I'll put it outside

851
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,260
Hey, there

852
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,260
Oh, this is

853
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,260
I'm sorry, this university is

854
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,260
People are angry

855
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:50,260
Just like the sun at 8 or 9 in the morning

856
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:53,260
How did this sun fall down?

857
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,260
Is this your school leader?

858
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:02,260
No, President Jia

859
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,260
You misunderstood

860
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,260
I am also a college student

861
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,260
I am their junior

862
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,260
Why

863
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,260
You

864
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,260
You are too

865
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,260
You said you are my junior

866
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,260
I'm not happy

867
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,260
President Jia is really humorous

868
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:23,260
Hurry up and take the uniform

869
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:25,260
Don't be so happy

870
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,260
This is to save fabric

871
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,260
You look a little more like a little princess

872
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:34,260
Which one is Zhang Muguir

873
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,260
President Jia, my surname is Zhang

874
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,260
But my name is not Muguir

875
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,260
My name is Zhang Lingkun

876
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,260
Why did you write the words are fat

877
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:54,260
Lingkun has grown a tomb

878
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,260
What kind of thing is this

879
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,260
I'm sorry

880
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,260
Come on, sit down

881
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,260
Take the chair

882
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,260
I'm so happy

883
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,260
Oh, that's great

884
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,260
I must be thirsty on the way

885
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,260
Pour some water

886
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,260
I ask you something

887
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,260
You said I don't pour this water

888
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,260
They won't be thirsty, do you believe it?

889
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:17,260
I don't believe it

890
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,260
Then don't pour it

891
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,260
This is good

892
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,260
This water is really sweet

893
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,260
Sweet?

894
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,260
The little river behind our house

895
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,260
That water is sweet and clean

896
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,260
Right, President Jia

897
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:37,260
Where are we going to wash our clothes in the future?

898
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:39,260
The little river behind

899
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,260
Where is the toilet?

900
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,260
The little river behind

901
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,260
The toilet next to the toilet

902
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:44,260
Are you scared?

903
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:50,260
I'm just kidding you

904
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:55,260
I can let you eat a lasagna

905
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,260
Solve it in one bottle

906
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,260
President Jia

907
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,260
We have heard about your design

908
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:05,260
You are guarding such a mountain village elementary school

909
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:07,260
It's been decades

910
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,260
I'm afraid of loneliness

911
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:11,260
This time, the committee asked us to come

912
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,260
Just to pick you up

913
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,260
Don't worry

914
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,260
We can definitely suffer

915
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,260
You can retire

916
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:20,260
This is the letter from the committee

917
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:22,260
The committee leader will come to you in two days

918
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,260
To hold a return party

919
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,260
I take it back

920
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,260
I tell you

921
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,260
Whoever asked me to retire

922
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,260
He won't come to the return party

923
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,260
What is that?

924
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,260
The retreat

925
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,260
Come here

926
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,260
Come here

927
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,260
What's going on?

928
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,260
I was still inviting guests

929
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,260
But when the guests came, the retreat was the main one

930
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:44,260
You can retire

931
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,260
You have been doing it for a lifetime

932
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,260
I think those kids are pretty good

933
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,260
What kids?

934
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,260
These kids are with the kids

935
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,260
Kids are with the kids

936
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,260
Isn't that a school card?

937
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,260
What card are you playing?

938
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,260
We have a total of ten kids

939
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,260
Ten kids is my life

940
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,260
I can give my life to them

941
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,260
Have you finished the notice on your book?

942
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:05,260
I will give you a notice

943
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,260
What?

944
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,260
Get out of here

945
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,260
What are you doing?

946
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,260
I am sending you off

947
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,260
No, President Jiang

948
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:14,260
We are here to give advice

949
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:16,260
If I am not capable enough

950
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,260
Can you let me go?

951
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:19,260
If you are not capable enough, can you leave?

952
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:22,260
If you doubt our capabilities

953
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,260
Let's make a mistake on the spot

954
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,260
Okay

955
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,260
How about this?

956
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,260
Let's make a mistake

957
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,260
Whoever loses, leaves

958
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,260
You go first

959
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,260
What are you doing?

960
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,260
I am a master artist

961
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,260
I am a piano professional

962
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,260
I am a violin professional

963
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,260
You are just a little bit of a violin

964
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,260
What?

965
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,260
You are a violinist

966
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,260
What does your DJ playing have to do with me?

967
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,260
Because I am not comparing with you

968
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,260
Please excuse me

969
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,260
As the saying goes

970
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,260
Good men don't fight with women

971
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,260
But I have a personality

972
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,260
that is known to be a man of the sun and a tiger

973
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,260
and is more like a volcano

974
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,260
Come on, lady

975
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,260
Let's have a fight

976
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,260
What are you doing?

977
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,260
Hello, President Jiang

978
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,260
I am a major in science and science

979
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:09,260
I was the top student in science and science in the province during the college entrance examination

980
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,260
During college

981
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,260
I represented the school

982
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,260
and won the Olympic Maths Competition

983
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,260
for the national championship

984
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,260
My graduation thesis

985
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,260
was also included in the textbook

986
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,260
at California University

987
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,260
I envy you

988
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,260
But what does it have to do with me?

989
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,260
I just want to pass you

990
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,260
and contact this little friend

991
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,260
What do you do?

992
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,260
I teach sports

993
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,260
You are so funny

994
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,260
You teach sports

995
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,260
Come here

996
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,260
You can't even stop me from teaching you sports

997
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,260
You want to teach sports to you

998
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,260
How can you develop your language?

999
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,260
Little chicken

1000
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,260
Hold it

1001
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,260
Don't move

1002
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,260
Your stomach is moving

1003
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,260
It's not appropriate

1004
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,260
Since you teach sports

1005
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,260
and you are so sharp

1006
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,260
I want to ask you

1007
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,260
What are you doing?

1008
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,260
Let's have a fight

1009
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,260
Let's have a fight

1010
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,260
Let's have a fight

1011
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,260
You can pick any English or math student

1012
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,260
Come on

1013
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,260
Brother-in-law

1014
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,260
We are a team

1015
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,260
I just want to ease the embarrassment

1016
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,260
President Jiang

1017
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,260
We don't have to go, do we?

1018
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,260
You have to go this time

1019
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,260
Our major is fine

1020
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,260
Your major is too bad

1021
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,260
It's fine

1022
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:23,260
You are so proud

1023
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:25,260
We can't use you

1024
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,260
We can't use you

1025
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:28,260
You have a piano

1026
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:30,260
You can go to our village

1027
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:32,260
Who can afford a piano?

1028
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,260
Play

1029
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,260
And you, big girl

1030
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,260
You and I are like family

1031
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,260
You and I are like a big competition

1032
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,260
What's the use?

1033
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:47,260
Our children can walk out of this mountain

1034
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,260
That's our dream

1035
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,260
Especially you

1036
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,260
I don't like you

1037
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,260
You are not tall

1038
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,260
You can make a lot of meat

1039
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,260
What's the use?

1040
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,260
Our children are not really nourished

1041
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,260
They don't have to be like Brother Xiang

1042
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,260
You can make a lot of meat

1043
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:59,260
You can stew the meat

1044
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,260
I tell you

1045
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,260
You have to make this book

1046
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,260
Make it clear to me

1047
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,260
That's it

1048
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,260
That's the virtue

1049
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,260
We can make it clear

1050
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,260
You are so brave

1051
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,260
Come on, make it clear

1052
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,260
You can read any textbook

1053
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,260
See if I can accept you on behalf of the children

1054
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,260
Come on

1055
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,260
Come on, Yong E

1056
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,260
You can say it

1057
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,260
E E E

1058
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,260
Qu Xiang Xiang Tian Ge

1059
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,260
White hair, white hair

1060
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,260
Red palm, red palm

1061
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,260
Stop it

1062
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,260
This goose told you to peel

1063
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,260
You never pull it

1064
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,260
Why do you read this goose

1065
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,260
It's the taste of iron pot

1066
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,260
What are you doing?

1067
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,260
What do you want me to read?

1068
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,260
You have to be serious

1069
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:38,260
You have to let the kids remember it

1070
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,260
E E E

1071
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,260
E E

1072
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,260
Look at what I read

1073
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,260
The size of the goose is read out

1074
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,260
A big goose brings a small goose

1075
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:05,260
Qu Xiang Xiang Tian

1076
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,260
White hair

1077
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:11,260
Green fruit

1078
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,260
Red palm

1079
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:20,260
I didn't understand the last sentence

1080
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,260
This performance is too exciting

1081
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,260
Let's do it the other way around

1082
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,260
Red palm

1083
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,260
You are peeling

1084
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,260
I am peeling the iron pot

1085
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,260
Why are you so stupid

1086
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:32,260
You are brave

1087
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,260
Don't be brave

1088
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,260
Go to the team

1089
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,260
Don't be brave

1090
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,260
You can't go

1091
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,260
Brother-in-law

1092
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:40,260
Can you stop it?

1093
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,260
Can't you just rest?

1094
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,260
How can I rest?

1095
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:45,260
Can I teach the kids?

1096
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,260
Who can sit

1097
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,260
Get up early in the morning

1098
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,260
To grind soy milk for the children

1099
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,260
Can't get up

1100
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,260
What to eat and drink

1101
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:56,260
Call takeout in your city

1102
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,260
Soy milk is here

1103
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,260
It's all soy milk

1104
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,260
I'm not leaving

1105
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,260
School is my home

1106
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,260
Children are my life

1107
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,260
This is my root

1108
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,260
I can't leave

1109
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,260
I tell you I call the school committee

1110
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,260
I let you go

1111
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,260
You call to let you go

1112
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,260
I don't believe

1113
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,260
Brother-in-law

1114
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,260
Lin Kun

1115
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:25,260
No, let's go back first

1116
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,260
What to go back

1117
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,260
Isn't this person sick?

1118
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,260
Yes

1119
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,260
He is sick

1120
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,260
You teachers

1121
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,260
You don't know

1122
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,260
My brother-in-law has been in poor health for the past few years

1123
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:42,260
I went to the hospital with him last month

1124
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,260
I found out

1125
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,260
Wanqi

1126
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,260
Everyone in the village knows

1127
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,260
Only he doesn't know

1128
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,260
Do you know why you came here?

1129
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:00,260
It's the people in the village

1130
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,260
Write to the school committee

1131
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,260
Tell them the situation

1132
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,260
Teachers

1133
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,260
Thank you

1134
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,260
Can come to our mountain ditch

1135
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,260
I have a request

1136
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,260
You just take my brother-in-law

1137
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,260
As a child

1138
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:22,260
Accompany him to fulfill his last wish

1139
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,260
OK?

1140
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,260
Teacher Gao

1141
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,260
Our school's teaching building

1142
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,260
When can it be built?

1143
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,260
It will soon be sealed

1144
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,260
After a few days, it will be moved in

1145
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,260
That's great

1146
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,260
Teacher Zhang

1147
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,260
The dormitory building is almost ready

1148
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:55,260
In the beginning

1149
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,260
Children can live in the new dormitory

1150
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,260
By the way

1151
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,260
