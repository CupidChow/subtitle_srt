00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,760
You always got caught

15
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,380
What?

16
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:03,380
New-born apple, free to eat!

17
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,380
Empress, I've been watching for two days.

18
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,380
I really can't stop laughing.

19
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,380
You're so noisy.

20
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,380
Didn't you have an idea?

21
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,380
You said that Snow White ate the apple.

22
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:31,380
I can become the most beautiful woman in the world.

23
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,380
Two days?

24
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,380
Where's Yan?

25
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:42,380
I'm telling you, Snow White won't eat the apple again.

26
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,380
Do you believe that I'm a worm?

27
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,380
It's the apple of the world.

28
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,380
Free to eat!

29
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,380
Is this free?

30
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,380
I'm so hungry. Can you feed me?

31
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:57,380
You can't eat the apple.

32
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,380
Snow White left it for me.

33
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,380
Who gave it to me?

34
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,380
You left it for you.

35
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,380
Thank you, but I don't want to eat it.

36
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,380
I'm not hungry.

37
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,380
You're not hungry?

38
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,380
I want to eat it. I'm so hungry.

39
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,380
You can't eat it.

40
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,380
You have to eat it.

41
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,380
It's interesting.

42
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,380
You don't want to eat it.

43
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,380
You're not going to let me eat it.

44
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,380
I'm not eating it.

45
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,380
I really want to eat it.

46
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,380
What do you want to eat?

47
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,380
You take it.

48
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,380
You eat it.

49
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,380
I don't want to eat it.

50
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:32,380
You're so stingy.

51
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,380
You...

52
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,380
You eat it.

53
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,380
You eat it.

54
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,380
Thank you.

55
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,380
You eat it.

56
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,380
Thank you.

57
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,380
You're done.

58
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,380
What are you doing?

59
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,380
What?

60
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,380
You have a stomachache.

61
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,380
You have me.

62
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,380
You have a stomachache.

63
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,380
You have a stomachache.

64
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,380
You're so beautiful.

65
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,380
How do you feel?

66
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,380
It's delicious.

67
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,380
It's sweet.

68
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,380
You're so stingy.

69
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,380
You're so beautiful.

70
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,380
You're so beautiful.

71
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,380
You're so stingy.

72
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,380
Can you stop for a while?

73
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,380
Hurry up.

74
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,380
Go to the hospital.

75
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:30,380
Doctor, save me.

76
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,380
Are you okay, aunt?

77
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,380
I'm leaving now.

78
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,380
Where are you going, Snow White?

79
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,380
I want to ask a WeChat with the devil.

80
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,380
From now on,

81
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,380
the devil and Snow White

82
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:49,380
live happily together.

83
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:53,380
Why is the fairy tale so scary?

84
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:56,380
It's different from what my grandma told me.

85
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,380
I miss home.

86
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,380
Where are you?

87
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,380
Who are you?

88
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,380
I'm Xiao Honghao.

89
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,380
You are...

90
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,380
I'm...

91
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,380
Don't care who you are.

92
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,380
I'm going to my grandma's house.

93
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,380
Do you want to go?

94
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,380
I'm not going.

95
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,380
I'm going to see my grandma.

96
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,380
Okay.

97
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,380
My grandma must have made me

98
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,380
a lot of delicious food.

99
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,380
Wait a minute.

100
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,380
Don't rush.

101
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,380
You're cooking delicious food, right?

102
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,380
I suddenly remembered that

103
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,380
maybe your grandma

104
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,380
is my grandma.

105
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,380
We might be a couple.

106
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,380
Really?

107
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,380
Let's go. I'll take you home.

108
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,380
Okay.

109
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,380
My grandma made me a lot of delicious food.

110
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,380
I'm a big pot.

111
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:53,380
I'll wait for Xiao Honghao to come back.

112
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,380
Is your grandma doing well?

113
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,380
Grandma.

114
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,380
Grandma.

115
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,380
You're back to visit your grandma.

116
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,380
Grandma.

117
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,380
I brought a good friend back.

118
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,380
Grandma.

119
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,380
When are you going to eat?

120
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,380
Don't make too many dishes.

121
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,380
Just make some pork stew noodles,

122
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,380
beef balls,

123
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,380
pork belly,

124
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,380
snow peas,

125
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,380
fried dumplings,

126
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,380
and some fried dumplings.

127
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,380
Xiao Honghao.

128
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:23,380
You brought a camel back.

129
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,380
That's too much.

130
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,380
Your hand...

131
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,380
is...

132
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,380
a wolf's hand.

133
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,380
It's so cute.

134
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,380
It's so cute.

135
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,380
Look at the hair color.

136
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,380
It's so cute.

137
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,380
Look at the work.

138
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,380
It's still a piece of fur.

139
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,380
Enough.

140
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:58,380
I told you that I'm a wolf's hand.

141
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,380
Maybe I...

142
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,380
I don't know.

143
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,380
Let me say it again.

144
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,380
I'm a wolf's hand.

145
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:19,380
I asked if you two could respect me.

146
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,380
I said I'm a wolf.

147
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,380
I'm going to eat you two.

148
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:29,380
You shouldn't be afraid of running.

149
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,380
It's scary.

150
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,380
It's so scary.

151
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,380
I'm a wolf.

152
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,380
You're so noisy.

153
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,380
Why am I so stubborn?

154
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,380
I'm a wolf.

155
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,380
He's really a wolf.

156
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,380
Run.

157
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,380
Don't run.

158
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,380
I have a firefly.

159
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,380
It's for you.

160
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,380
Oh, my god.

161
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,380
Come on.

162
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,380
You're a wolf.

163
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,380
You're a firefly.

164
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,380
Mom, you're so hot.

165
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,380
I don't believe it.

166
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,380
Come on.

167
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,380
What's going on?

168
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,380
I'll do it again.

169
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,380
Again.

170
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,380
Go on.

171
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,380
Look.

172
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,380
It's going to blow up.

173
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,380
Look.

174
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,380
It's already blinded.

175
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,380
Come on.

176
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,380
What's that?

177
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,380
I can't eat it.

178
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,380
I can't eat it.

179
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,380
I'll do it again.

180
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,380
I'm sorry.

181
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,380
Thank you for taking me back.

182
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,380
It's not me.

183
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,380
It's him.

184
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,380
He can't do it.

185
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,380
It's true.

186
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,380
I'm leaving.

187
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,380
Bye.

188
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,380
Where are you going, Little Red Cat?

189
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,380
I want his...

190
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,380
The wolf's hand.

191
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,380
It's so scary.

192
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,380
Little Red Cat was killed

193
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,380
by two million people

194
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,380
when he was killed by two million people.

195
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,380
He didn't get hurt

196
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,380
without buying love.

197
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,380
It's so scary.

198
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,380
I want

199
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,380
to find my grandma.

200
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,380
Chao Long.

201
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,380
Little Red Cat.

202
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,380
Grandma.

203
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,380
Grandma.

204
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,380
I'm so sorry.

205
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,380
I'm so sorry.

206
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,380
I'm sorry.

207
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,380
I like you, too.

208
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,380
I'm so sorry, grandma.

209
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,380
Grandma.

210
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,380
It's okay.

211
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,380
Grandma.

212
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,380
You told me

213
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,380
so many fairy tales.

214
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:41,380
It's different now.

215
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:44,380
You're a joke again.

216
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,380
How is that possible?

217
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,380
Grandma.

218
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,380
Do you know that

219
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,380
the white blood princess

220
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,380
is apart from the wolf.

221
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,380
The rain in the rain is standing still.

222
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:01,300
The world, on its breaking point,

223
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:10,700
At the date of deathless eggs on its

224
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:14,820
wasn't so go租 time and food.

225
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,940
You tell me,

226
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,320
Great The einem ausolate world can eat

227
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,200
when you still want to eat.

228
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:29,200
The best dried fruit

229
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:35,200
You are so stupid

230
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,200
You know it every day

231
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,200
I tell you, he won't come to save you

232
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,200
Wait

233
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,200
I eat pig's feet

234
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,200
Get out

235
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,200
I can't take it

236
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,200
When can you come to save me?

237
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,200
I come to save you

238
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,200
I am Yang Guo

239
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,200
18 years old

240
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,200
I have been looking for my aunt

241
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,200
Today I finally find a fruit

242
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,200
I have been afraid that I can't recognize her

243
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,200
Dear

244
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,200

245
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,200

246
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,200
You were the one

247
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:44,200
I want to be apart, but I will be apart

248
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,200
Now I have a love

249
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,200
I come back

250
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,200
You are so stupid

251
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,200
Get down

252
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,200
Be careful of your image

253
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,200
I am so excited

254
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,200
I am excited too

255
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,200
You are so...

256
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:22,200
Where is the koupo?

257
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,200
I tried to save you

258
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,200
But I got a knife in my hand

259
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,200
I got a knife in my hand

260
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,200
The doctor said I was a knife

261
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,200
But I got a knife in my hand

262
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,200
It's okay

263
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,200
If I can save you today

264
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,200
I will be willing to give up no matter how much I lose

265
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:54,200
You are so gentle

266
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:59,200
I want to ask you something

267
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,200
Ask

268
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,200
I am so stupid

269
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,200
Who gave you the knife?

270
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,200
Qi

271
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,200
Are you stupid?

272
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,200
Are you a man?

273
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,200
What man?

274
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,200
I told you men don't have good things

275
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,200
Shut your mouth

276
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,200
We men don't have good things

277
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,200
We men fight for the family and the world

278
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,200
What's the result?

279
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,200
The result is the leader

280
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,200
The property is for the children

281
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,200
The money is for the wife

282
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,200
The wife is not careful

283
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,200
It's possible for others

284
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,200
Only the mistake and the lack

285
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,200
Is the man's own

286
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,200
Is it easy for men?

287
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,200
Yes

288
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,200
Beautiful

289
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:53,200
I will never doubt you again

290
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,200
As long as you are sincere to me

291
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,200
No one can stop us

292
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,200
Together

293
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,200
You two can't be together

294
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,200
Who?

295
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,200
I will take her away today

296
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,200
You let me go

297
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,200
I will let you go

298
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,200
I will not eat too much

299
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,200
What do you want?

300
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,200
According to the rules of the martial arts

301
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,200
You should beat me first

302
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,200
I can let you go

303
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,200
Since so

304
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,200
I will let you taste my martial arts

305
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,200
I will let you go

306
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,200
I will let you go

307
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,200
Let's go

308
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,200
You are so cold

309
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,200
Why do you go out?

310
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,200
What do I do?

311
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,200
I will let you go

312
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,200
I can only use it when I am very sad

313
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,200
I am so excited

314
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,200
I can't use it

315
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,200
What should I do?

316
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,200
You are so excited

317
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,200
You hurt me

318
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,200
I will let you go

319
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,200
I will beat you

320
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,200
You can't beat me

321
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,200
You are so ugly

322
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,200
Why do you say that?

323
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,200
I am so handsome

324
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,200
How can I say that I am ugly?

325
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,200
I have a relationship with an old friend

326
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,200
One more time

327
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,200
I have a relationship with an old friend

328
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,200
I am so ugly

329
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,200
My child is already a big brother

330
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,200
He is so handsome

331
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,200
You are so true

332
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,200
I almost believed it

333
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,200
I said it was true

334
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,200
I am so close to you

335
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,200
Don't chase

336
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,200
Let's go

337
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,200
What?

338
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,200
Explain it to me

339
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,200
You and the old friend have a child

340
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,200
I said those words just to stimulate you

341
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,200
What do I know about you?

342
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,200
Ok

343
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,200
As long as you are sincere to me

344
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,200
No one can stop us

345
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,200
Let's fight again

346
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:29,200
You two can't be together

347
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,200
Why are you here?

348
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,200
Who is he?

349
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,200
I am the first-ever master of love

350
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,200
Li Mo Chou

351
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,200
You are Li Mo Chou?

352
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,200
I don't know him

353
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,200
I don't care if you know him or not

354
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,200
I am going to tell you

355
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,200
It's between you two

356
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,200
You are the third-ever master

357
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,200
Don't be so mean

358
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,200
What did you say?

359
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,200
He is the third-ever master

360
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,200
Why are you scolding me?

361
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,200
You two can be dead

362
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,200
I am the one who can stimulate you

363
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,200
The old king and the next king

364
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,200
It's all true

365
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,200
Stop

366
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,200
I don't want to use this trick

367
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,200
I am so sad

368
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,200
I want you to try my skills

369
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,200
Sun Shenshu

370
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,200
Sun Shenshu

371
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,200
Li Mo Chou, you can die

372
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,200
Li Mo Chou

373
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,200
You can't stop me

374
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,200
Wow

375
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,200
Sun Shenshu is so awesome

376
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,200
They are exactly the same

377
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,200
I can't tell you

378
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,200
Which one is real

379
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,200
Which one is fake

380
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,200
So awesome

381
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,200
Stop talking

382
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,200
Get out of here

383
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,200
Li Mo Chou, you can die

384
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,200
I beg you

385
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,200
You are wrong

386
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,200
Li Mo Chou

387
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,200
You can't stop me

388
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,200
Okay

389
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,200
You are so shameless

390
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,200
I tell you

391
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,200
You two will have a good result

392
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,200
Chase me

393
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,200
Explain it to me

394
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,200
Explain what?

395
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,200
Why did he say I am the third-ever master?

396
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,200
What's the relationship between you and Chou?

397
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,200
You are a bastard

398
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,200
You said I am a bastard

399
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,200
What is a bastard?

400
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,200
What is a bastard?

401
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,200
In the Northeast

402
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,200
A bastard is a magical animal

403
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,200
It can be pulled

404
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,200
It can be mounted

405
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,200
It can be played

406
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,200
If you pull out the bastard

407
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,200
and go home with me

408
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,200
I will let you play with the bastard

409
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,200
In the end

410
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,200
you will be a bastard

411
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,200
Yes

412
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,200
It is a bastard

413
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,200
You are a bastard

414
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,200
This is the poison of the power

415
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,200
Awesome

416
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,200
We can stop the poison

417
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,200
We will finish the poison

418
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,200
when we come back

419
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,200
As long as you are sincere to me

420
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,200
No one can stop us

421
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,200
Together

422
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,200
You two can't be together

423
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,200
Who is this?

424
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,200
You two can't be together

425
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,200
Fan Hai

426
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,200
We can't be together

427
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,200
Yes

428
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,200
Fan Hai

429
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,200
Why can't we be together?

430
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,200
Because you don't deserve to have

431
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,200
mortal love

432
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,200
Why can't I

433
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,200
have mortal love?

434
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,200
Yes

435
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,200
Although he is mortal

436
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,200
Why can't he

437
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,200
have love?

438
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,200
You are a snake demon

439
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,200
What is a snake demon?

440
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,200
Yes

441
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,200
What is a snake demon?

442
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,200
Can't you have love?

443
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,200
Fan Hai

444
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,200
You don't understand love

445
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,200
I will let you know

446
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,200
what is real love

447
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,200

00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,200

I am a snake demon

451
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,200
What is a snake demon?

452
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,200
A snake demon

453
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,200
I have no work

454
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,200
Who are you?

455
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,200
I am a vegetarian

456
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,200
Old man

457
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,200
Who are you?

458
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,200
Fan Hai

459
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,200
Where is this?

460
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,200
Lei Fengta

461
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,200
Isn't this a dream?

462
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,200
You are all the same

463
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,200
The dream is right there

464
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,200
Sorry

465
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,200
I am going to the wrong place

466
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,200
I am leaving

467
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,200
Come back

468
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,200
Who?

469
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,200
You

470
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,200
What?

471
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,200
Come back

472
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,200
Who?

473
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,200

00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,200
What?

476
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,200
Are you going to your aunt?

477
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,200
How do you know?

478
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,200
She is looking for your aunt

479
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,200
Because your aunt

480
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,200
has been saved by Xu Xian

481
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,200
They are too much

482
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,200
Longer

483
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,200
I have waited for you for 18 years

484
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,200
You ran away with a drug

485
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,200
Guan Ran

486
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,200
You are sad now

487
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,200
Who is Guan Ran?

488
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,200
I am Yang Guo

489
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,200
I don't care

490
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,200
whether you are Yang Guo or Nong Guo

491
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,200
Anyway, from now on

492
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,200
You are going to be a snake demon

493
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,200
Why do you always ask me

494
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,200
to be a snake demon?

495
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,200
You are a snake demon

496
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,200
In fact, in our hometown

497
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,200
the snake is called Xiaolong

498
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,200
If you don't mind

499
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,200
you can call me Xiaolongnv

500
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,200

Xiaolongnv

503
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,200
Guo'er

504
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,200
Before that

505
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,200
we have shared

506
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,200
many little tricks

507
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,200
We hope that

508
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,200
in the busy life

509
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,200
we can relax

510
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,200
and solve our problems

511
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,200
Today

512
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,200
we have a friend

513
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,200
who shared

514
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,200
a little trick

515
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,200
called

516
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,200
Relaxing Hands

517
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,200
How to do it?

518
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,200
Look at it

519
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,200
First, put your hands out

520
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,200
and hold your fists

521
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,200
Yes

522
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,200
and then open your arms

523
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,200
You will feel this tension

524
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,200
and relaxation

525
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,200
feeling of relief

526
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,200
Don't say that

527
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,200
After holding it like this

528
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,200
The blood circulation

529
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,200
of the hand in the middle of the activity

530
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,200
is faster

531
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,200
It feels like it's very tight

532
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,200
You know what I mean

533
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,200
It's the same in our life

534
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,200
You can't always

535
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,200
be nervous and nervous

536
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,200
Right?

537
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,200
One by one

538
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,200
You can relax

539
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,200
when you are not tired

540
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,200
Right?

541
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,200
One by one

542
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,200
My god

543
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,200

Thank you

547
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,200
I won't drink

548
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,200
Hold me

549
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,200
Hot

550
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,200
Hot

551
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,200
Hot

552
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,200
No

553
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,200
My friend

554
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,200
Why did you come out

555
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,200
wearing this?

556
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,200
Where is your clothes?

557
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,200
Where is my wife?

558
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,200
Where is your wife?

559
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,200
In the car

560
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,200
Which car?

561
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,200
The car that was just drove by

562
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,200
You were pulled down

563
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,200
Take it

564
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,200
You are so serious

565
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,200
You are so big

566
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,200
Why did you pull down the car?

567
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,200
What's going on?

568
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,200
You

569
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,200
Don't know

570
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,200
The car was hot

571
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,200
My wife was thirsty

572
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,200
I

573
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,200
went to the car

574
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,200
and bought her some soup

575
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,200
The soup was hot

576
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,200
I went back

577
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,200
I saw there were many people in the car

578
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,200
My wife was not fit

579
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,200
I was smart

580
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,200
I came down

581
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,200
I came down

582
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,200
I thought

583
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,200
the moon

584
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,200
would come back to our car

585
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,200
I didn't expect

586
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,200
the car to be so fast

587
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,200
Bro

588
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,200
Don't you know

589
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,200
your wife is in the car?

590
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,200
Yes

591
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,200
Call her now

592
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,200
I didn't have the phone

593
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,200
Where is your phone?

594
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,200
In my bag

595
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,200
Where is my bag?

596
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,200
Where is my clothes?

597
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,200
Where is my wife?

598
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,200
Where is my wife?

599
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,200
The car was pulled down

600
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,200
Run away

601
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,200
I

602
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,200

00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,200
with my phone

607
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,200
How many times did she call you?

608
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,200
I don't remember

609
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,200
What about your phone?

610
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,200
I am in the bag

611
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,200
I am in the bag

612
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,200

Call my wife

618
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,200
She is so angry

619
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,200
My wife

620
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,200
The car was pulled down

621
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,200
Do you think it is funny?

622
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,200
Don't scold me

623
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,200
I am your husband

624
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,200
I am not a fraud

625
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,200
I am the one who is scolding

626
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,200
I am the one who is scolding

627
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,200
Who made me think?

628
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,200
Who made me look so sad?

629
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,200
You are not a fraud

630
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,200
I am a fraud

631
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,200

There is another car in the northeast

636
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,200
You can go to the car

637
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,200
and make a ticket

638
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,200
Okay

Okay

50 years

656
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,200
50 years

657
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,200
Then you still have a dear one

658
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,200
How did you do this?

659
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,200
I forgot her name

660
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,200
I dare not ask her

661
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,200
Then I will ask her

662
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,200
Dear

663
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,200

Look

00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,200

00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,200
What bag?

724
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,200

Brother, you can do it

733
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,200
The bag of the New Year

734
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,200
Is it a little bit cool?

735
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,200
He is not cool

736
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,200
Sister, it's okay

737
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,200

Who do you think this is?

746
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,200
We are two-mouthed

747
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,200
You are a group of people

748
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,200
You still have to make money

749
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,200
I will make money

750
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,200

Are you full of money?

755
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,200
No

756
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,200
Why did you take the bag?

757
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,200
Who told you to go forward and ignore me?

758
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,200
You don't want to tell me directly about the New Year

759
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,200
Who did you look at your face?

760
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,200
What do I look at?

761
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,200
Police officer

762
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,200
Did you see my face?

763
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,200
A little bit

764
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,200
Look at you

765
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,200
Do you dare to show me

766
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,200
Your short letter to your mother?

767
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,200
What are you talking about?

768
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,200
Look

769
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,200
I will take the money if you check it

770
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,200
I will check it

771
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,200
I can let you check it

772
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,200
Brother, you two are so mean

773
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,200
Bad

774
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,200
You are so bad

775
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,200
What's wrong?

776
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,200
Police officer

777
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,200
Thank you

778
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,200
Don't mention it

779
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,200
Why are you so mean?

780
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,200
I am just...

781
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,200
How can I be mean to you?

782
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,200
How?

783
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,200
My phone is in my wife's hand

784
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,200
Is there any problem?

785
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,200
There is a big problem

786
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,200
Every old man's phone

787
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,200
is for his wife

788
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,200
I understand

789
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,200
You are behind your wife

790
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,200
You are doing bad things

791
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,200
No

792
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,200
What are you afraid of?

793
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,200
Isn't it New Year?

794
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,200
I gave my parents a million yuan

795
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,200
It's good

796
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,200
What?

797
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,200
That's my private money

798
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,200
My wife doesn't know

799
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,200
Then tell her

800
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,200
I tell her

801
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,200
My wife is so naughty

802
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,200
If she knows I have private money

803
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,200
She will make me a private dish

804
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,200
I am so sorry

805
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,200
Look

806
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,200
You can solve it yourself

807
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,200
My phone

808
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,200
My wife

809
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,200
Your wife understands

810
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,200
How can I answer your phone?

811
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,200
You are a police officer

812
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,200
You are a bad person

813
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,200
I am afraid of police

814
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,200
Don't scold me

815
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,200
I am not your husband

816
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,200
I am a police officer

817
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,200
Listen to me

818
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,200
Your husband

819
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,200
He paid his parents

820
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,200
with his private money

821
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,200
You didn't say it

822
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,200
Fine

823
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,200
Fine

824
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,200
I will tell her

825
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,200
Bro

826
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,200
Your wife asked me to tell you three things

827
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,200
First

828
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,200
She just transferred 20,000 yuan to your parents

829
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,200
Did you hear that?

830
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,200
Your parents

831
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,200
I told her

832
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,200
I didn't

833
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,200
What about the second one?

834
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,200
For fairness

835
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,200
She also transferred 20,000 to her parents

836
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,200
I should

837
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,200
What about the third one?

838
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,200
It's all your phone

839
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,200
Bro

840
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,200
You should hold it

841
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,200
50,000 yuan for private money

842
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,200
I will pay it

843
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,200
I will pay it

844
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,200
Keep on

845
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,200
What did you find?

846
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,200
Who is this woman?

847
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,200
You

848
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,200
Is this your photo?

849
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,200
I look like this

850
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,200
You look like that

851
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,200
I look like this

852
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,200
Beauty

853
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,200
Beauty

854
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,200
You are so naughty

855
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,200
You don't love me

856
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,200
If you want to do this

857
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,200
We can't take pictures

858
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,200
Come back

859
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,200
I said come back

860
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,200
Police

861
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,200
Police

862
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,200
You can take pictures of us

863
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,200
You can't go to trouble

864
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,200
Fine

865
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,200
I won't

866
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,200
Sit down

867
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,200
Come on

868
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,200
Get ready

869
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,200
Take a photo

870
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,200
Beauty

871
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,200
Come on

872
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,200
Ready

873
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,200
One, two, three

874
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,200
Three

875
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,200
Thank you

876
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,200
How do you feel?

877
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,200
Dear

878
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,200
Look at the photo

879
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,200
Don't call me dear

880
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,200
Call me Ming

881
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,200
Qiu Xiang

882
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,200
You can't remember

883
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,200
You look like

884
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,200
Tang Bo Hu

885
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,200
Call me Qiu Xiang

886
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,200
Rui Zhi

887
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,200
Hurry up

888
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,200
I said Rui Zhi

889
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,200
Rui Zhi

890
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,200
Look at this

891
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,200
Who is Rui Zhi?

892
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,200
Sit down

893
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,200
I said, big mom

894
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,200
Where are you going this New Year?

895
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,200
Go to the airport

896
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,200
Go back

897
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,200
What go back?

898
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:42,200
We met there when we were young

899
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,200
Yes

900
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,200
We met that day

901
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,200
I was brave

902
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,200
What are you brave

903
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,200
I was brave

904
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,200
What am I doing there?

905
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,200
You stood on the ice

906
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,200
You secretly talked to me

907
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,200
I almost fell into the ice

908
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,200
I was the Wang family

909
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,200
I took him out

910
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,200
Oh, the water was cold that day

911
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,200
The water was cold

912
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,200
Who remembers this?

913
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,200
I remember

914
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,200
He is pretty

915
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,200
Thank you

916
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,200
Police

917
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,200
Big mom

918
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,200
Police

919
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,200
I'm not afraid of your laughter

920
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,200
I'm old

921
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,200
I can't remember my name

922
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,200
I can't say

923
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,200
I'm afraid of my own dignity

924
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,200
So many years

925
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,200
I take him to the airport every year

926
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,200
I'm afraid he forgets

927
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,200
the past

928
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,200
I just made him talk to you

929
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,200
I want to break his mind

930
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,200
Don't be annoyed

931
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,200
I understand

932
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,200
How can I be annoyed

933
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,200
You said you were annoyed

934
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,200
How can I be annoyed

935
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,200
I can't say it right

936
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,200
Police

937
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,200
Listen to me

938
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,200
You two

939
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,200
We have been married for three years

940
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,200
He told me his father missed him in the Spring Festival

941
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,200
I went back with him

942
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,200
His mother missed him in the second year

943
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,200
I went back with him

944
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,200
He said his sister missed him again

945
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,200
He is so close to his sister

946
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,200
You should go back with him

947
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,200
His sister is too close

948
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,200
Dog

949
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,200
Sister, you are too much

950
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,200
Police

951
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,200
He is more than me

952
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,200
You went back with me for three days

953
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,200
You slept for two days

954
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,200
Is it Spring Festival or winter

955
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,200
I want to sleep

956
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,200
I asked him before going

957
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,200
Can his father drink

958
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,200
He said he can't

959
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,200
I found out after going

960
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,200
My father-in-law can't drink

961
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,200
But he didn't tell me

962
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,200
He can't drink

963
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,200
And he is fast

964
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,200
He goes to the table

965
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,200
Grandpa

966
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,200
Come and have a taste

967
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,200
I told you

968
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,200
I spent two Spring Festival at home

969
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,200
I haven't heard of hot dishes

970
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,200
Brother

971
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,200
Isn't it good

972
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,200
Both of them are the same

973
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,200
Who's different

974
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,200
Different

975
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,200
Brother

976
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,200
Big eyes

977
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,200
Good

978
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,200
Go to your wife's house every year

979
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,200
Good

980
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,200
Let the neighbors know

981
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,200
Can laugh at you

982
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,200
You listen

983
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,200
Who are you going back to

984
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,200
My wife

985
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,200
You go back to your wife's house

986
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,200
You are not afraid of neighbors laughing

987
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,200
I would have let them laugh

988
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,200
Don't

989
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,200
You still have a chance

990
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,200
Hold it

991
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,200
What hold it

992
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,200
Tell you

993
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,200
Don't go home with me next year

994
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,200
OK

995
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,200
divorce

996
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,200
This

997
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,200
Still playing

998
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,200
Li Jiu Li

999
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,200
Who do you think you are

1000
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,200
Don't go home

1001
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,200
Don't go home

1002
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,200
Don't go home

1003
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,200
Don't go home

1004
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,200
Don't go home

1005
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,200
What are you doing

1006
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,200
What are you doing

1007
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,200
What are you doing

1008
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,200
This is a divorce

1009
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,200
Are you really going to be a divorce

1010
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:47,200
It's not easy for the two of us to be together

1011
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,200
That's right

1012
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,200
Look at this old friend

1013
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,200
It's been 50 years since we were together

1014
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,200
Now one of us is in love

1015
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,200
Big eyes, tell them

1016
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,200
Have you ever proposed to your mother

1017
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,200
I forgot

1018
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,200
This little boy

1019
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,200
Just to finish the soup for your wife

1020
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,200
I didn't even get in the car

1021
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,200
You said he was a cold-blooded brother

1022
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,200
Did he ever complain

1023
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,200
dare not

1024
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,200
This is love

1025
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,200
Isn't it

1026
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,200
Besides, you two still have a chance to talk

1027
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,200
Who will go back to their home next year

1028
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,200
Some people don't have a chance at all

1029
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,200
He can't go home at all

1030
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,200
What do you want

1031
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,200
You have to think about it for your parents

1032
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,200
If your parents know

1033
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,200
You two are standing on the stage

1034
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,200
To go back to your home

1035
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,200
Get the wedding ceremony

1036
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,200
But are you afraid of going back

1037
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,200
Sit there

1038
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,200
What are you looking at

1039
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,200
Hello mom

1040
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,200
Son

1041
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,200
You are at the little house

1042
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,200
In the car station

1043
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,200
I and your dad

1044
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,200
Just arrived at the three-story house

1045
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,200
The tour is coming

1046
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,200
Don't worry about us

1047
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,200
When you arrive at the little house

1048
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,200
Have a good New Year

1049
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,200
As long as you are happy

1050
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,200
We are relieved

1051
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,200
Mom, don't tell you

1052
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,200
I and your dad

1053
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,200
Are going to swim

1054
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,200
Hang up

1055
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,200
Okay mom

1056
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,200
What are you talking about

1057
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,200
Mom said

1058
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,200
He and dad are on a trip to the three-story house

1059
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,200
The big New Year

1060
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,200
Go to the three-story house

1061
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,200
Really fake

1062
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,200
Fake

1063
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,200

1064
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,200
Husband

1065
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,200
This year is New Year

1066
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,200
Let's go back to your house

1067
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,200
Go

1068
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,200
Husband

1069
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,200
Mom said

1070
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,200
As long as we are happy

1071
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,200
They are relieved

1072
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,200
Come back to my house next year

1073
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,200
How good is this

1074
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,200
Put it away

1075
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,200
What are you doing

1076
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,200
Aunt

1077
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,200
Come out

1078
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,200
Come out quickly

1079
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,200
Don't pull things

1080
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,200
Hold the old man

1081
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,200
Aunt, you take this, six-car box

1082
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,200
Okay

Please take it

1090
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,200
Please get in the car

1091
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,200
Thank you

1092
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,200
Don't move

1093
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,200
Please take it

This is six-car box

1097
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,200
That way

1098
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,200
Sister, the three-story house is gone

1099
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,200
Go

1100
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,200
Go to that side

1101
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,200
Okay, thank you

1102
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,200
Thank you

Please take it

1107

What is this

1108
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,200
I can't take it

1109
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,200
I'm sure

1110
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,200
If you have something

1111
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,200
Please take it

1112
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,200
The car is not stopped for three minutes

1113
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,200
Why are you in a hurry

1114
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,200
You don't have three minutes

1115
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,200
My wife and I are left for one minute

1116
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,200
Dear

1117
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,200
Hello

1118
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,200
Dear

1119
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,200
Hello

1120
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,200
Hello

Dear

1123
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,200
My mother and I are holding you

1124
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,200
It's still hot

1125
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,200
I just think about your award all the way

1126
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,200
Come

1127
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,200
I'll eat one

1128
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,200
It smells good

1129
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,200
It smells so good

1130
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,200
Okay

1131
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,200
We are finally old

1132
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,200
Dear, take it and eat it

1133
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,200
Eat it

1134
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,200
I have to go

1135
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,200
My wife and I are back

1136
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,200
I'm back for three times

1137
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,200
My parents are waiting for you to pass the year

1138
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,200
I bought you clothes

1139
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,200
Do they like it

1140
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,200
They like it

1141
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,200
It's still a shoe

1142
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,200
It's a shoe

1143
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,200
