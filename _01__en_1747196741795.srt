00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,020
An

2
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,280
Hello I am 저

3
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,580
today I went home

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,840
yesterday I brought back a portrait

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,800
from kindergarten

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,760
I asked who did this

7
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:24,940
My son conservation

8
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,080
I am very proud to tell me

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,860
This is my best mother

10
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:28,200
Where you live

11
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,240
Here

12
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,240
the most beautiful mother.

13
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,800
I looked left, looked right, looked up, looked down.

14
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,120
I still didn't see where it looked like me.

15
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,080
I was joking with him.

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,240
It's so ugly.

17
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,600
It doesn't look like me at all.

18
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,040
My son explained seriously that

19
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,640
I will put on makeup for him later.

20
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,000
Son,

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,040
you have to draw it well.

22
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,600
Oh my god.

23
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,720
Report to headquarters.

24
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,240
I have arrived at the rescue site.

25
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,880
Where is the rescue personnel?

26
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:05,840
Brother, brother.

27
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,400
Don't talk about my work.

28
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
Brother, brother.

29
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,520
Look at me.

30
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,520
Look at what I'm doing.

31
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,520
I don't have time to look at you.

32
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,800
Look at me.

33
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,480
I...

34
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,920
You have to be my big brother.

35
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,920
I have no eyes.

36
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,480
You...

37
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,840
You just have to be my brother.

38
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,400
Oh my god.

39
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,080
Isn't this good?

40
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,240
I am the bomb expert Xiong Ziqi.

41
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,520
Now I come to rescue you.

42
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,680
You just calm down and it's over.

43
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,880
No, I can't calm down.

44
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,880
From the beginning to the end,

45
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,000
I was afraid when I saw the bomb.

46
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,880
It's okay.

47
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,800
Don't worry.

48
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,280
I will save you.

49
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,280
Don't worry.

50
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,760
As a bomb expert,

51
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,280
I have a natural advantage over others.

52
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,400
Natural advantage?

53
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,600
Yes.

54
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,600
I can't kill you.

55
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,320
I have a compulsive disorder.

56
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,680
Compulsive disorder?

57
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,920
I have night blindness.

58
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,560
Is your bomb related?

59
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,600
Just because I have compulsive disorder,

60
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,400
I am not allowed to make any mistakes.

61
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,000
So in my task,

62
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,320
I have never failed.

63
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,520
Let me see your bomb.

64
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,120
Hold it.

65
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,800
Your bomb.

66
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,040
I know your bomb.

67
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,080
Just calm down.

68
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,040
It will be over soon.

69
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,040
It's okay.

70
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,240
What's wrong?

71
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,360
This bomb...

72
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,640
You look so ugly.

73
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,520
Are you a bomb expert?

74
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,120
Apologize to the bomb quickly.

75
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,480
Apologize to the bomb?

76
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,320
Save me.

77
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,760
I can't save you if you don't apologize.

78
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,760
I feel bad.

79
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,280
Okay.

80
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,280
I apologize.

81
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,360
Bomb expert.

82
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:34,920
I am sorry.

83
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,120
I look so ugly.

84
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,320
Don't blame me.

85
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,640
Blame others.

86
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,120
Okay.

87
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,080
Help me.

88
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,120
Help me.

89
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,360
I will help you.

90
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,560
I will help you.

91
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,240
Hurry up.

92
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,240
Head shape.

93
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,160
What's wrong with your head shape?

94
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,360
It's not symmetrical.

95
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,320
I will fix it for you.

96
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,160
You are so annoying.

97
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,080
Hurry up.

98
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,040
It's symmetrical.

99
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,240
Stop bragging.

100
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,400
Where is the hair?

101
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,440
Look at your hair.

102
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,920
It's so uncomfortable.

103
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,440
You are so...

104
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,520
You are so useless.

105
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,080
Hurry up.

106
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,960
You look so handsome.

107
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,640
I have no time.

108
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,760
Hurry up.

109
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,240
Okay.

110
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,400
I will fix it for you.

111
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,920
Don't worry.

112
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,440
Come on.

113
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,960
It's so hard.

114
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,760
Are you ready?

115
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,800
Are you really ready?

116
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,440
Okay.

117
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,040
Hurry up.

118
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,080
Oh my god.

119
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,200
What's wrong with you?

120
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,080
Are you kidding me?

121
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,040
What's wrong with me?

122
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,400
You are so ugly.

123
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,200
You are so ugly.

124
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,400
Oh my god.

125
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,560
Well.

126
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,680
You have to say...

127
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,440
What's it called?

128
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,240
Say something.

129
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,440
Say something.

130
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,200
Stop bragging.

131
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,080
Hurry up.

132
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,840
It's time to say goodbye.

133
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,320
I can't do it if you don't say it.

134
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,480
Say it.

135
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,320
It's uncomfortable.

136
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,240
It's here.

137
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,980
Black

138
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,120
What's it called?

139
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,840
Black

140
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,200
Black?

141
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,960
Ah.

142
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,480
Who invented the tongue twister?

143
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,440
I will kill him.

144
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,680
What's it called?

145
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,520
It has a bug.

146
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,520
What bug?

147
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,560
I have lived in a rural area.

148
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,120
There is no black.

149
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,440
There are white and gray.

150
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,720
White is the urine.

151
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,720
Gray is the urine.

152
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,480
Ah.

153
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,560
Right?

154
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,560
It seems so.

155
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,040
It's a bug.

156
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,080
It should be said that

157
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,400
white is the urine.

158
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,880
Gray is the urine.

159
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,680
Put it in the ground and run to the middle.

160
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,280
White is the urine.

161
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,120
Yes.

162
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,440
Gray is the urine.

163
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,400
Why?

164
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,480
Are you thinking about it?

165
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,680
I said I was not thirsty.

166
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,600
But when I sang,

167
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,960
I was not thirsty.

168
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,080
When I sang,

169
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,360
I said,

170
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,560
hurry up and cut the line.

171
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,200
I will die in the office.

172
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,480
You are talking too much.

173
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,520
What song are you singing?

174
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,360
I sing a song.

175
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,920
It's okay.

176
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,360
Two people's song is good.

177
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,160
We love to listen to two people's songs.

178
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,200
Come on.

179
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,080
Oh, come on.

180
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,040
Cut the line.

181
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,640
Don't let me sing.

182
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,400
Do you sing?

183
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:21,920
No.

184
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,120
If you don't sing, I can't cut the line.

185
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,960
If you can't cut the line, I will die.

186
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,880
I don't sing.

187
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,160
If you don't sing, I will die.

188
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:32,480
A pole is over the wall of flowers.

189
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:37,720
The little maid taught me to be sad.

190
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,640
Is it okay?

191
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,280
Stop singing.

192
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,120
Standing at the edge of the blue sky,

193
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,720
the second maid washed the big beam.

194
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:51,960
The little maid taught me to be sad.

195
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,960
Cut the line.

196
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,880
Hurry up.

197
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,360
Oh, my god.

198
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,000
You are so bad.

199
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,360
You don't know the first part.

200
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,840
I don't know the last part.

201
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,560
What do you mean?

202
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,080
It's sad.

203
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,960
Teach me.

204
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:14,000
The little maid taught me to be sad.

205
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,360
No.

206
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:25,200
Ah.

207
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,200
That's it, right?

208
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,240
It's good.

209
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:27,840
You know it?

210
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,280
Yes.

211
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,440
Okay, I will go back to practice.

212
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:29,840
Okay.

213
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,080
The little maid is so talented.

214
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,160
If you don't sing, you will be sad.

215
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,680
Come back.

216
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,320
Oh, my god.

217
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,320
I am so sad.

218
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,640
You don't know the last part.

219
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,800
Do you forget something?

220
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,880
What?

221
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,200
You didn't pay the tuition.

222
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:49,880
What tuition?

223
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,240
Guess.

224
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,920
Hurry up.

225
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,560
Guess.

226
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,040
Why are you shouting?

227
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,440
I am looking.

228
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,440
Guess.

229
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:07,440
Oh, my god.

230
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,040
Are you going to kill me?

231
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,960
What's wrong?

232
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,400
Why don't you have a pair of shoes?

233
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,600
Take it off.

234
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,600
Take it off.

235
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:25,400
Oh, my god.

236
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,600
What's wrong?

237
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,160
Are you going to kill me?

238
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,760
You wear socks and two shoes.

239
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,160
I can't stand it.

240
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,680
Well, where is the money?

241
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,360
Here.

242
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,160
Take it.

243
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,560
Is it suitable?

244
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,040
Is there any black stuff on the bottom?

245
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,080
What?

246
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,840
Just black stuff.

247
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,640
What?

248
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,760
Is it big?

249
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,280
Yes.

250
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,000
No.

251
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,920
No.42.

252
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,480
It's big.

253
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,120
Okay.

254
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,200
Come on.

255
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,120
I am so talented.

256
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,400
Get up.

257
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,400
Time.

258
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,880
Get up.

259
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,640
Oh, my god.

260
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,520
Back.

261
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,000
Okay.

262
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,080
I am so nervous.

263
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:10,680
Oh, my god.

264
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,160
I am finally done.

265
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,440
Great.

266
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,480
I am so happy.

267
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,040
Really.

268
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,280
I have one minute and one second left.

269
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,280
What?

270
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:25,680
One minute and one second.

271
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,200
You want to kill me.

272
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,000
How can you do that?

273
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,680
One second.

274
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,760
What are you doing?

275
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,480
Don't move.

276
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,160
Stand up.

277
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:33,880
What?

278
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,840
I will help you.

279
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,160
Come on.

280
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,000
I will help you.

281
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,760
No.

282
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,600
No.

283
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,800
I will walk for one more second.

284
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,600
Just one second.

285
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,240
You are forcing me.

286
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,920
You are crazy.

287
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,760
One more second.

288
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,600
Just one second.

289
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,240
Hello, everyone.

290
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,120
I am Song Erlong, who is shouting in the crowd.

291
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,360
Do you know me?

292
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,280
Yes.

293
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,720
I am the famous artist of our village.

294
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,360
As long as the leaders come to our village,

295
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,560
our village director will let me play various roles

296
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,120
and show the leaders.

297
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,240
Mainly, I will praise him.

298
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,160
He is shouting at me.

299
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,960
There must be someone on the stage.

300
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,840
Can I help him to fool the leaders today?

301
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,560
Yes.

302
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,040
Who?

303
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,160
You.

304
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,360
Such a good-looking girl.

305
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,040
She can do anything.

306
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,120
Hey, Song Erlong.

307
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,240
Director Ju.

308
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,440
Are you going to make a comeback?

309
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,480
Why are you here?

310
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,920
I am here.

311
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,280
The procuratorate will be here soon.

312
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,040
The old rules.

313
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,360
At the critical moment, I will rush there

314
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,280
and be a leader.

315
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,920
I will praise him.

316
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,680
OK.

317
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,760
The old rules.

318
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,160
Give me your lines today.

319
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,680
I forgot such an important thing.

320
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,760
It's too late.

321
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,680
You didn't give me the lines.

322
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,000
How can I praise him?

323
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,040
It doesn't matter.

324
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,960
Just say that I have done good things.

325
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,880
Have you done good things?

326
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,880
Do I need you to praise me?

327
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,880
Director.

328
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,480
Can you change another person?

329
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,480
There are so many people in our village.

330
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,120
You can't let me suffer alone.

331
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,800
I don't want to see your face.

332
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,760
Look at your face.

333
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,360
It's so deceitful.

334
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,400
You are so arrogant.

335
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,560
Your face is so simple.

336
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,000
Director, you mean I don't lie to people easily.

337
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,600
I lie to people one by one.

338
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,480
You are so bad.

339
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,400
Director.

340
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,200
Look at the villages around us.

341
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,600
The village head has been leading us to a good life.

342
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,000
The village head has been leading us to build a dam.

343
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,880
Now they are green ecological park

344
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,880
and yellow rice village.

345
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,600
It used to be a famous village.

346
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,920
The village head has been leading us to build a food processing plant.

347
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,800
They have been living in poverty for a long time.

348
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,280
You should...

349
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,600
Baby.

350
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,680
Look at those village head.

351
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,400
They can't even stand up.

352
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,800
Look at my waist.

353
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,120
Where is your waist?

354
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,760
It's none of your business.

355
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,640
My waist is still strong.

356
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,560
This big waist.

357
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,560

365

The most exciting PG game on the line of Aomei New Peking Entertainment City 005005.com

366
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,440
It's so expensive.

367
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,000
Don't think it's useless.

368
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,960
Let me tell you.

369
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,360
If you play well today,

370
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,840
I will give you

371
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,040
a high compensation rate.

372
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,800
What if I don't play well?

373
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,880
You will be in danger.

374
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,800
I will play well.

375
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,600
I will play well today.

376
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,840
But you can't

377
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,520
stand alone in this scene.

378
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,720
I have invited a leading role.

379
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,640
You can help him.

380
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,360
There is someone in our village who can act.

381
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,880
The new son-in-law of Liu.

382
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,200
He is from the county theater troupe.

383
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,520
Can the county theater troupe do this for you?

384
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,840
If he doesn't do it,

385
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,120
I won't give him the treasure of the golden city.

386
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,840
The treasure is a policy set by the country.

387
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,280
You can't give it to him.

388
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,280
What?

389
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,040
I will decide my territory.

390
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,440
What is that?

391
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,400
A donkey.

392
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,400
A donkey?

393
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,560
If I say he is a horse,

394
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,240
who dares to say he is a donkey?

395
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:09,000
A donkey.

396
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,520
Do you dare?

397
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,760
I don't dare.

398
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,800
You just say he is you.

399
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,040
We have no objection.

400
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,040
Master, the meeting is over.

401
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,480
Wait a minute.

402
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,840
The son-in-law of Liu has come here.

403
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,600
I don't know him.

404
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,360
I haven't seen him.

405
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,440
I haven't seen him either.

406
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:23,840
It's okay.

407
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,160
He came here by car.

408
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,640
He hasn't done this job yet.

409
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,760
You should talk to him.

410
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,120
When the procuratorate comes,

411
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,360
you two go out

412
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,560
and give me a high-fives.

413
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,240
High-fives.

414
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,760
Look at his style.

415
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,160
He is like a ball.

416
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,720
How can I give you a high-fives?

417
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,080
Yes.

418
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,720
I am a high-fives.

419
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,360
Leader,

420
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,840
the other villages are very good in this case.

421
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,240
Only the village of director Ju

422
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,000
has a lot of people's opinions.

423
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:55,800
Yes.

424
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,800
I just want to see

425
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,640
how they act.

426
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,600
Yes.

427
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,880
You are here.

428
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,160
The son-in-law of Liu

429
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,800
is here to help the village director.

430
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,880
Act?

431
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,840
The leader is here.

432
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,720
He is here to help the director.

433
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,120
He is here to help the leader.

434
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,480
Yes.

435
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,360
You are here.

436
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,960
What are you doing?

437
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,200
You are from the county village, right?

438
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,440
The conditions are good.

439
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,160
Your martial arts skills are very good.

440
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,200
I tell you.

441
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,080
When the leader comes,

442
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,920
you should be more energetic.

443
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,840
Don't be so crazy.

444
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,040
Don't keep your eyes closed.

445
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,520
No.

446
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,840
I am fighting.

447
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,240
Fighting?

448
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,200
Oh my god.

449
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,160
His eyes are so selfish.

450
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,200
He can see others,

451
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,320
but others can't.

452
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,240
What do you mean?

453
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,160
Nothing.

454
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,240
I am fighting.

455
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,360
What do you mean?

456
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,760
I am fighting.

457
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,600
Oh my god.

458
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,800
The county village is so ugly.

459
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,560
His daughter?

460
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,040
Yes.

461
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,240
Come here.

462
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,480
What are you counting?

463
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,040
The pig.

464
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,280
It's the 60th of the new year.

465
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,320
Yes.

466
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,480
The pig is 36 years old.

467
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,400
Oh my god.

468
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,920
Who can see it?

469
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,760
The face is so ugly.

470
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,240
So ugly.

471
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,560
What's wrong with you?

472
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,080
Nothing.

473
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,240
Oh my god.

474
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,600
I understand that you are here.

475
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,200
You are here for your father-in-law's treasure.

476
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,400
I am here to get our house's renovation money.

477
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,240
Otherwise, who can do this?

478
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,320
What do you mean?

479
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,400
The director said

480
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,640
when the leader comes,

481
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,440
we should rush to him.

482
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,680
We should give him a good blow.

483
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,680
Give him a blow?

484
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,600
What good thing did he do?

485
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,120
He did good things.

486
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,680
He didn't even do human things.

487
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,720
Oh my god.

488
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,760
He is just saying nonsense.

489
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,080
Oh my god.

490
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,840
The actor is the first one to act.

491
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,600
He is so fast.

492
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,080
He can open his eyes.

493
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,960
Oh my god.

494
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,600
He will hear it later.

495
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,920
Your father-in-law will come down with the treasure.

496
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,000
Yes.

497
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,320
He won't act and give you the treasure, right?

498
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,960
The director didn't say that.

499
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,120
He will let you wait.

500
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,680
When will it be?

501
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,280
When the treasure comes down,

502
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:18,080
your father-in-law will come down with the treasure.

503
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,720
I am so lucky.

504
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,400
What do you mean?

505
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,080
I am so lucky.

506
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,120
I am telling you.

507
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,400
When the leader comes,

508
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,680
we should give him a good blow.

509
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,520
No.

510
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,480
I can't give him a good blow.

511
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,200
I am afraid that he will blow up.

512
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,080
Don't blow up.

513
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,600
Or I will be in trouble.

514
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,480
Come on.

515
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,600
Read this letter.

516
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,880
I read it last time.

517
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,560
It's not from the same group.

518
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,640
You wrote it?

519
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,040
I did.

520
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,280
The director spent money on his old friend.

521
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,920
Should I memorize it?

522
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,240
You can't memorize it.

523
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,400
I have read it for half a year.

524
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,600
I can't memorize it.

525
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,600
Why?

526
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,720
It's not a good word.

527
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,720
It's hard to memorize.

528
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,240
I really want to see

529
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,160
what it is.

530
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,080
The legend of the small village.

531
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,560
You can't read it like that.

532
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,040
The director wants a good one.

533
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:07,880
You should use your strength.

534
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,560
Use my strength?

535
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,200
Think about your father-in-law.

536
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,480
The treasure.

537
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,880
The treasure.

538
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:17,000
The legend of the small village.

539
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,320
The legend of the small village.

540
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,600
Let's set a small goal.

541
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,800
Let's earn two hundred million.

542
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,440
One year of earning two hundred million.

543
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,720
The director is the remote control.

544
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,880
The remote control.

545
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,960
When it is launched,

546
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,120
the history record is broken.

547
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,200
The record is the first.

548
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,240
The director is the excavator.

549
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,240
The excavator.

550
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,280
It's stronger.

551
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,640
The director is the

552
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,640
flying machine.

553
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,640
Flying machine.

554
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,640
Okay.

555
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,120
The treasure is down.

556
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,680
You just act like this.

557
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,440
It's too easy.

558
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,120
Oh my god.

559
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:03,460
You are a

560
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,460
remote control.

561
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,720
You have ever acted this?

562
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,360
Then you can show us.

563
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,360
Don't make a scene.

564
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,360
Show us.

565
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,480
The crowd's cheering.

566
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,560
If you don't act,

567
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,960
I won't act.

568
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,440
You...

569
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,840
Play this song for me.

570
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,840
There is music?

571
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,720
Of course.

572
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,960
When the leader came that day,

573
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,040
the director specially arranged

574
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,560
to play this song.

575
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,880
To make the atmosphere more lively.

576
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,920
The director gave me this song.

577
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,440
I usually practice with it.

578
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,440
Start.

579
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:47,240
They started acting.

580
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:51,480
I love you, leader.

581
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,480
Our leader, thanks to our leader

582
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,480
You still think of our small remote village

583
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,480
Actually our life is going very well

584
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,480
Because we have a good leader

585
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,480
Who?

586
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,480
Tao, Tao

587
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,480
Tao, Tao, Tao, Tao, Tao

588
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,480
He is the village director

589
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,480
The village director

590
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,480
He is the village director

591
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,480
He said he would be at the village

592
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,480
He is our village director

593
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,480
Director

594
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,480
Young man

595
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,480
You really cry

596
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,480
No crying

597
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,480
Last time I just got wet and it didn't rain

598
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,480
The director fined me 500 yuan

599
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,480
500?

600
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,480
Your director is so good

601
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,480
Why do you choose him?

602
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,480
Oh my god, this question is good

603
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,480
I tell you

604
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,480
When choosing the village director

605
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,480
Our director has a trick

606
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,480
You see, when choosing the director

607
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,480
Everyone can vote for two candidates

608
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,480
The director said

609
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,480
The first vote, you vote for yourself

610
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,480
Humanity

611
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,480
The second vote, you must vote for me

612
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,480
Humble

613
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,480
The last vote

614
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,480
All the village men and women

615
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,480
Everyone is one vote

616
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,480
Only our director has the most votes

617
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,480
He chose

618
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,480
He chose

619
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,480
Is there no one you are afraid of?

620
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,480
Afraid of people above

621
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,480
Last time a leader came and said one sentence

622
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,480
What's the situation?

623
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,480
He was scared and he was at home for several days

624
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,480
Oh, what if I came from above?

625
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,480
You came from above

626
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,480
You go up

627
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,480
Hey, Sun Erneng

628
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,480
Director

629
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,480
You can go back

630
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,480
No, I didn't act

631
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,480
What to act?

632
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,480
At this time, the police will definitely not come

633
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,480
You changed my room into a piece of paper, right?

634
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,480
You didn't act, what paper?

635
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,480
Then I didn't come even if I didn't act

636
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,480
Then I came

637
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,480
Didn't the inspection team come?

638
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,480
Why didn't the inspection team come?

639
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,480
Are you afraid of the inspection team coming?

640
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,480
If you have that kind of inspection team, go find it

641
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,480
I'll give you a fart now

642
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,480
How do you know I can't find it?

643
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,480
What do you mean?

644
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,480
What do you mean?

645
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,480
The inspection team is here

646
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,480
Where?

647
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,480
He is from the inspection team

648
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,480
You stand up

649
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,480
The production team is all靠 you

650
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,480
You help me

651
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,480
You are

652
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,480
My surname is Gao

653
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,480
Special inspection team

654
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,480
The high tide is coming

655
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,480
You're not talking nonsense, are you?

656
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,480
No

657
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,480
Act

658
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,480
What?

659
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,480
Act

660
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,480
Act

661
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,480
Act?

662
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,480
Act

663
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,480
He didn't give me the reformed room change, can I act?

664
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,480
Yes

665
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,480
He didn't give me the reformed room change, what's going on?

666
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,480
What's going on?

667
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,480
I've already approved it

668
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,480
Take it

669
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,480
Can the old Liu Zou's?

670
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,480
What's going on with the low treasure?

671
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,480
He's already approved it

672
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,480
Take it

673
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,480
Then you'll get my 500 yuan

674
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,480
What's going on?

675
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,480
He's a little hesitant, isn't he?

676
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,480
Give it back

677
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,480
I'm here

678
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,480
Take it

679
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,480
I don't want to fight

680
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,480
Leader, you've seen it, right?

681
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,480
The public interest is no small matter

682
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,480
I'm doing my best for the sake of the villagers

683
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,480
Although I'm sick, my waist is not good

684
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,480
What's going on with his waist?

685
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,480
His waist is fat

686
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,480
Leader, I'll answer the phone

687
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,480
I didn't expect you to be so good

688
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,480
It's a pity that you're just a trap

689
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,480
If you're really from the inspection team, you should hide

690
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,480
Yes, yes, yes

691
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,480
Yes, Chief Gao is here

692
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,480
Please call him

693
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,480
Okay

694
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,480
Hide

695
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,480
Chief Gao

696
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,480
You're here

697
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,480
Okay, okay, okay

698
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,480
See you at the village committee

699
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,480
What's going on?

700
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,480
You're really Chief Gao

701
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,480
Your eyes are not small

702
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,480
Small, my eyes are too selfish

703
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,480
Leader, this guy can't talk

704
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,480
He's telling the truth

705
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,480
You're acting with us every day

706
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,480
Why do other villages live a good life?

707
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,480
Because all the village leaders

708
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,480
are thinking about doing things for the people every day

709
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,480
You're thinking about how to trick the leaders

710
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:52,480
Can the people live a good life?

711
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,480
Leader

712
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,480
Your situation is under control by the organization

713
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,480
I'll talk to you later

714
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,480
Talk to me? What do you mean?

715
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,480
You want to...

716
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,480
You want to...

717
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,480
We'll talk about it later

718
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,480
I'm going to...

719
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,480
Do you dare to form the material of your words?

720
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,480
I dare

721
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,480
I dare to sign and print

722
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,480
The party and the government will support us

723
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,480
We people are not afraid of anything

724
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,480
Leader

725
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,480
I admit that I have many shortcomings and shortcomings in my work

726
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,480
But I never forget

727
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,480
I was born with hardships

728
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,480
I'm a farmer's son

729
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,480
You know you're a poor farmer's son?

730
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,480
When you didn't give the people a land

731
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,480
Why didn't you think of the farmers as your father?

732
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,480
When you blocked the people's illegal reform

733
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,480
Why didn't you think of the people as your father?

734
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,480
When you were in the village

735
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,480
How did you not think of the farmers as your father?

736
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,480
Well said

737
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,480
What's wrong, brother-in-law?

738
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,480
Look at your style

739
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,480
You're a firewood for selling girls

740
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,480
I'm a mushroom for picking up girls

741
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,480
I changed your tongue's shoelaces

742
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,480
What are you doing here?

743
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,480
This is not a girl's rebellion

744
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,480
No, this is not a firewood rebellion

745
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,480
You're messing with me

746
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,480
What are you doing?

747
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,480
Why are you late for work today?

748
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,480
I'm stuck

749
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,480
There is only one road in our village

750
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,480
I can't see people for eight generations

751
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,480
Who blocked you?

752
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,480
You're a fool

753
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,480
I'm late

754
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,480
Then you're late

755
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,480
I'm not afraid you hit me

756
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,480
I'm more ruthless

757
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,480
I know it now

758
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,480
Meeting

759
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,480
What meeting?

760
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,480
What's the name?

761
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,480
National University of the Frontal and Vascular Institute

762
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,480
48th All-Person Education Conference

763
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,480
Brother-in-law

764
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,480
Is it necessary to have a meeting of this size?

765
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,480
Although the size is small

766
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,480
But it must be proper

767
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,480
We have a ceremony

768
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,480
Name

769
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,480
You still call it a name

770
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,480
Name

771
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,480
Mr. Yuwen

772
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,480
I'm late

773
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,480
Mr. Shu Yuan

774
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,480
I'm late

775
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,480
Mr. Ying Yu

776
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,480
I'm here

777
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,480
Principal

778
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,480
You dare to call the principal

779
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,480
Are you stupid?

780
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,480
I'm late

781
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,480
Security

782
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,480
I'm late

783
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,480
Get up

784
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,480
Yes

785
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,480
You said our school is a total of two of us

786
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,480
You ordered this name

787
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,480
I said, bring the microphone

788
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,480
Why do you take the microphone?

789
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,480
The horn has been almost for years

790
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,480
What do you use it for?

791
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,480
Can't you do it without a microphone in a meeting?

792
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,480
Give it to you

793
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,480
Give it to you

794
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,480
This ceremony

795
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,480
Another

796
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,480
Who has no microphone in a meeting?

797
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,480
You don't have a horn

798
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,480
Can you make the effect of the horn?

799
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,480
Hello

800
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,480
Hello

801
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,480
I said

802
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,480
Is it fun?

803
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,480
Is it fun?

804
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,480
What are you talking about?

805
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,480
From that Shifan University

806
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,480
A few college students graduated

807
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,480
Ready to come to our primary school to teach

808
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,480
I think this is a good thing

809
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,480
What do you think

810
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,480
You said it earlier

811
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,480
Go to

812
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,480
How to get it?

813
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,480
Our village's highest standard

814
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,480
The horse to pick up

815
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,480
beautiful

816
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,480
It's not yet here

817
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,480
President Jia

818
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,480
Here

819
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,480
President Jia

820
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,480
Come

821
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,480
Someone picked it up

822
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,480
Someone picked it up

823
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,480
President Jia

824
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,480
Thank you, thank you, thank you

825
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,480
President Jia

826
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,480
We came all the way here

827
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,480
Look at this mountain and water show

828
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,480
It's really good

829
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,480
Yes

830
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,480
At first I heard that

831
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,480
Use the horse to pick us up

832
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,480
Really don't need

833
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,480
This is still talking

834
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,480
The one who is honest

835
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,480
Why don't you use it?

836
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,480
No

837
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,480
We walked here ourselves

838
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,480
You didn't pick it up

839
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,480
I picked it up

840
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,480
He called the horse

841
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,480
President Jia is really humorous

842
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,480
Humorous

843
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,480
I think it's still a little bit missing

844
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,480
President

845
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,480
Someone is here

846
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,480
Then I'll go back

847
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,480
Then you go to the health center

848
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,480
No, you come on

849
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,480
No, go to eat

850
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,480
Hurry up and go in

851
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,480
Come back

852
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,480
I'll put it outside

853
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,480
Oh my god

854
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,480
I mean, the university is

855
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,480
People are so angry

856
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,480
Just like the sun at 8 or 9 in the morning

857
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,480
How did this sun fall?

858
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,480
Is this your school leader?

859
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,480
No, President Jia

860
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,480
You misunderstood

861
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,480
I am also a college student

862
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,480
I am their junior

863
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,480
Why

864
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,480
No, you

865
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,480
You are too

866
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,480
You said you are my junior

867
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,480
I'm not happy

868
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,480
President Jia is so humorous

869
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,480
Hurry up

870
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,480
Take the uniform

871
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,480
Take the uniform

872
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,480
Don't be so happy

873
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,480
To save fabric

874
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,480
You look a little bit like a little princess

875
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,480
May I ask which one is Zhang Muguir

876
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,480
Teacher

877
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,480
President Jia

878
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,480
My surname is Zhang

879
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,480
But I'm not called Muguir

880
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,480
My name is Zhang Lincun

881
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,480
Lincun

882
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,480
Why did you write the word flying?

883
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,480
Lincun has grown a wooden stick

884
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,480
What is this?

885
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,480
Sorry

886
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,480
Come on, sit down

887
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,480
Come on, sit down

888
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,480
Take the stool

889
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,480
I'm so happy

890
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,480
This is great

891
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,480
You must be thirsty all the way

892
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,480
Pour some water

893
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,480
Let me ask you something

894
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,480
If I don't pour the water

895
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,480
They won't be thirsty

896
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,480
Do you believe it?

897
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,480
I don't believe it

898
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,480
Then why don't you pour it?

899
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,480
Come on

900
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,480
Drink

901
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,480
This is great

902
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,480
This water is really sweet

903
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,480
Sweet?

904
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,480
The little river behind our house

905
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,480
The water is sweet and clean

906
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,480
Very good

907
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,480
By the way, President Jia

908
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,480
If we wash clothes in the future

909
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,480
Where to go?

910
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,480
The little river behind

911
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,480
What about bathing?

912
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,480
The little river behind

913
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,480
What about going to the toilet?

914
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,480
The little river behind

915
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,480
The toilet next to it

916
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,480
Are you scared?

917
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,480
I'm just kidding you

918
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,480
I can let you eat a lasagna

919
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,480
Solve it in one box

920
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,480
President Jia

921
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,480
We've heard about your design

922
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,480
Look at you

923
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,480
You are guarding such a mountain village elementary school

924
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,480
It's been decades

925
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,480
I'm afraid too

926
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,480
I'm lonely and lonely

927
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,480
This time, the committee asked us to come

928
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,480
Is to pick up your class

929
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,480
Don't worry

930
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,480
We can definitely suffer

931
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,480
You can retire in glory

932
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,480
This is the letter from the committee

933
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,480
Notification

934
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,480
In two days, the committee leader

935
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,480
I'll give you a special delivery

936
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,480
I take it back

937
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,480
I tell you

938
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,480
Whoever asked me to retire

939
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,480
He's not here to open a delivery

940
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,480
What is that?

941
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,480
Drinking party

942
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,480
Come here

943
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,480
What's the situation?

944
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,480
I was still hosting guests

945
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,480
Just now

946
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,480
As a result, the guests came

947
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,480
The class is the main

948
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,480
You can retire

949
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,480
You've been doing it all your life

950
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,480
I think those kids are pretty good

951
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,480
What kids

952
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,480
These kids

953
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,480
Take the kids

954
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,480
Kids with kids

955
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,480
Isn't that a school brand?

956
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,480
What brand are you?

957
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,480
We have a total of ten kids

958
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,480
Ten or so kids is my life

959
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,480
I can give my life to them

960
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,480
Have you finished your notification notice?

961
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,480
I'll tell you in a mouthful

962
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,480
What?

963
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,480
Go away

964
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,480
What are you doing?

965
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,480
Delivery

966
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,480
No, President Jiang

967
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,480
We're here to give you a lesson

968
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,480
If I'm not capable

969
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,480
You can let me go

970
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,480
I said you're not capable

971
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,480
Go, okay?

972
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,480
If you question our ability

973
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,480
Let's make a mistake on the spot

974
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,480
Okay

975
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,480
Let's make a mistake

976
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,480
Whoever loses, goes

977
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,480
You first

978
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,480
What are you doing?

979
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,480
I'm a master of art

980
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,480
I'm a professional piano teacher

981
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,480
I'm a violin teacher

982
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,480
You're just a beginner

983
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,480
What?

984
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,480
You're a beginner

985
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,480
What does your DJ teacher have to do with me?

986
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,480
Because I didn't say I was going to compete with you

987
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,480
Please excuse me

988
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,480
As the saying goes

989
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,480
Good men don't fight with women

990
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,480
But I have a personality

991
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,480
That knows how to play the drums

992
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,480
And is more like a volcano

993
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,480
Come on, lady

994
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,480
Let's fight

995
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,480
What are you doing?

996
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,480
Hello, President Jiang

997
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,480
I'm a major in science

998
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:08,480
I was the top student in science in the province during the college entrance examination

999
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,480
During college

1000
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,480
I represented the school

1001
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,480
And won the Olympic Math competition

1002
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,480
On behalf of the school

1003
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,480
I won the championship

1004
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,480
My graduation thesis

1005
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,480
Was also included in the textbook

1006
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,480
At California University

1007
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,480
I envy you

1008
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,480
But what does it have to do with me?

1009
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,480
I just want to pass you

1010
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,480
And get in touch with this kid

1011
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,480
What do you do?

1012
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,480
I'm a sports teacher

1013
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,480
You're so funny

1014
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,480
A sports teacher

1015
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,480
Come here

1016
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,480
You can't even stop me from teaching you sports

1017
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,480
You want to teach you sports

1018
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,480
How do you develop your language?

1019
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,480
Little muscles

1020
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,480
Hurry up

1021
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,480
Don't move the stomach

1022
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,480
It's not appropriate to move the stomach

1023
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,480
Since you teach sports

1024
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,480
And you're so sharp

1025
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,480
I want to ask

1026
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,480
What are you doing?

1027
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,480
Let's compete

1028
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,480
Let's compete

1029
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,480
Let's compete

1030
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,480
If you think you're a math student

1031
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,480
You can pick whatever you want

1032
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,480
Brother-in-law

1033
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,480
We're a team

1034
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,480
I just want to ease the embarrassment

1035
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,480
Mr. Jiang

1036
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,480
We don't have to go, right?

1037
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,480
You have to go this time

1038
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,480
Our major is fine

1039
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,480
Your major is too problematic

1040
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,480
It's not a problem

1041
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,480
You guys are so proud

1042
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,480
Our temple can't use you

1043
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,480
You just got up to the top 10

1044
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,480
You went to our 10-mile-high village

1045
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,480
Where did you go?

1046
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,480
Who can afford a piano?

1047
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,480
Play

1048
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,480
And you, big girl

1049
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,480
You're like my family

1050
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:53,180
You have a big

1051
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,480
I told you

1052
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,480
You have to make this book

1053
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,480
And the rest of the things clear

1054
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,480
That's it

1055
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,480
That's the virtue

1056
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,480
We can make this book more clear

1057
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,480
You're so brave

1058
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,480
Come on, you have to figure it out

1059
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,480
You can just send a text

1060
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,480
You can read it

1061
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,480
See if I can accept you on behalf of the child

1062
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,480
Swim the goose

1063
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,480
You swim

1064
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,480
Goose, goose, goose

1065
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,480
Go to the sky

1066
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,480
White hair, green water

1067
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,480
Red palm, wave the green wave

1068
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,480
Stop it

1069
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,480
This goose is asking you to wave

1070
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,480
You're so useless

1071
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,480
Why do you read a goose

1072
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,480
I have to read it out

1073
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,480
It's not my taste

1074
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,480
Then how do I read it

1075
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,480
You have to be clear

1076
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,480
You have to let the child remember at once

1077
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,480
Goose

1078
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,480
Look at me reading

1079
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,480
The goose is reading out the big and small

1080
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,480
A big goose brings a small goose

1081
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,480
Go to the sky

1082
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:11,480
White hair, green water

1083
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,480
Red palm

1084
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,480
I didn't understand the last sentence

1085
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,480
This performance is too exciting

1086
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,480
Let's turn the scene around

1087
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,480
Red palm

1088
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,480
You're not listening to the broadcast

1089
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,480
Then I'm a blacksmith

1090
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,480
Why are you in the shield

1091
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,480
You're a swan

1092
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,480
Don't swim the goose

1093
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,480
Go to the team

1094
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,480
Don't swim, go

1095
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,480
I can't go

1096
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,480
Brother-in-law

1097
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,480
Can you stop making trouble

1098
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,480
Can't you just rest

1099
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,480
How can I rest

1100
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,480
Can I give the child to them

1101
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,480
Can you

1102
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,480
Who can sit down

1103
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,480
Get up early in the morning

1104
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,480
To grind soy milk for the child

1105
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,480
Can't get up

1106
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,480
What to eat and drink

1107
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,480
Order takeout from your city

1108
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,480
Soy milk is already soy milk

1109
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,480
I'm not leaving

1110
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,480
School is my home

1111
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,480
The child is my life

1112
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,480
This is my root

1113
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,480
I can't leave

1114
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,480
I tell you I call the school committee

1115
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,480
I let you guys go

1116
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,480
I called you to let you go

1117
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,480
I don't believe it

1118
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,480
Brother-in-law

1119
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,480
Lin Kun

1120
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,480
No, let's go back first

1121
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,480
What to go back for

1122
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,480
Isn't this person sick

1123
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,480
Yes

1124
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,480
He is sick

1125
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,480
You guys

1126
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,480
You don't know

1127
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,480
My brother-in-law has been in poor health for the past few years

1128
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,480
I went to the hospital with him last month

1129
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,480
I found out

1130
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,480
Late

1131
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,480
Everyone in the village knows

1132
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,480
Only he doesn't know

1133
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,480
Do you know why you came here

1134
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,480
It's the people of the village who wrote letters to the school committee

1135
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,480
Tell them the situation

1136
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,480
Teachers

1137
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,480
Thank you

1138
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,480
Can come to our mountain ditch

1139
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,480
I have a request

1140
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,480
You take my brother-in-law

1141
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,480
As a child

1142
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,480
Accompany him to complete

1143
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,480
Last wish

1144
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,480
Can it be

1145
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,480
Have you left

1146
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,480
So you

1147
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,480
Teacher Gao

1148
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,480
Our school's teaching building

1149
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,480
When can it be built

1150
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,480
It's about to be sealed

1151
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,480
